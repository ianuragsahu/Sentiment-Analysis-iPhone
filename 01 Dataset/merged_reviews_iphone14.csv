reviews
That ad had some questionable music Did a double take
Theyre acting like it still having last years A15 is a feature lol
RIP iPhone Mini
Play your mOsT iNtEnSe GaMe  shows some random ass rail shooter Alright then
Has anyone noticed the ridiculous price increase in Europe The iPhone 13 still costs 899 the AirTags increased by 10 and the base Iphone 14 now costs 999 Why 
Only thing they did was basically replace the number 13 with 14 and get rid of the Mini
God damn it now all the android manufacturers are going to start removing some trays
Did they just renamed iPhone 13 and sold it again at full price addressing existing features
As every year passes phones get less and less impressive in general Not just Apple but in general IMO Makes it easier to hold onto your existing models
RIP iPhone mini 
At its European price point its an iPhone 13 with slightly better features for pretty much the full retail price of a 13 Pro Converted in USD which is 11 btw its 1030 How are they selling this
deleted
Definitely a skip generation Literally  iPhone135
"This aint it chief

Old chip minimal if any improvements

edit lol no sim tray either All downgrades no upgrades Miniscule improvements in low light photography is not worth a thousand bucks"
The marketing people at Apple are the real MVPs Imagine having to create a 15hr underwhelming presentation but making it seem exciting
A15 
I was really hoping that they at least upgrade it to A16 bionic This is just iPhone 13 renamed to iPhone 14 with extremely minor improvements
Lmao 1019 euro for a base 14 Go home Apple youre drunk
still has notch and no usbc Not impressed
Not gonna lie The SIM removal is a huge dealbreaker and massively anti consumer I run dual sims so apple can frick right off
Iphone 14  basically just an iphone 13 just more expensive Buy now
eSIM ONLY WTF
Im on the XS and will keep waiting until USBC is implemented
Gonna stock up on bunch of 13 minis
"So let me get this straight

 Souped up camera versus iPhone 13
 iPhone 13 will remain on the market
 Retail price likely to be 200 dearer than the iPhone 13 by the time this is released in the UK
 Almost all the new features are exclusive to the Pro model

Itd have made more sense to do what they did with the X  keep the old one on the market and just concentrate on the Pro model"
The lack of iPhone mini is a real punch in the dick I dont want a large bulky phone
They removed SIM tray entirely for US models Holy st thats dumb Relying on dumb service providers to manage something you could swap yourself is just idiotic The moment they do this in Europe Ill stop using iPhone And same goes for all other brands This removes users control over connectivity entirely and I think its terrible
"Lmao they really took away the SIM card

Thatll be problematic for a lot of customers Like me 

Im a cheapo on prepaid plans Att refuses to let me make a esim now so how the hell am I gonna be able to transfer it over when I move phones

Dual sim use Thats the other thing right now Work line Home line Its nice to keep the work sim physically 

This aint it for me sadly"
Could hear all the US folk booing at no physical sim
Cant believe they didnt throw in a new processor I hope this trend does not stay
Waiting for surprise iPhone 14 ultra with spiky rubber and snow falling  off it
Its a scam they are trying to sell me last years phone lol
lol iPhone 14 is the worst upgrade ever
"Jesus their greenwashing is so cringe they just released a new model of AirPods Which again are not repairable Once the battery is done they just go to the trash

Do people actually believe that bullshit"
"	Same design as iPhone 13
	Same A15 Bionic
	Same launch price
	Gain new camera hardware
	Gain Plus model
	Lose SIM card tray in the US only
	Lose Mini model"
I see nothing different I rather stick with my pro max and wait to see what the 15 is
Welp Maybe Ill get an iPhone 15
I was so excited but am now so disappointed guess Ill buy the 13 mini then
The pricing in Europa is way out of control The iPhone 14 is now priced almost the same as the 13 Pro last year Insane
no physical sim is bogus very anticustomerwhich is on brand for apple I guess iPhone 13 here I come
"14Plus was underwhelming Hoping Pro is more exciting

Edit Pro was indeed more exciting"
"RIP iPhone Mini

Looking forward to the review comparisons between the 14 and 13 though"
Theres gonna be a black market in the US for international iPhone models with SIM trays
A repackaged 13 Pro
Still no native support for the FLAC audio format
"Im an Android person but the death of the Mini is really sad I hoped for an Android manufacturer to copy it While I still thought it was too tall it was so much better than anything else My sister has an iPhone 11 and I laugh at how big it is Mad thats where Apple starts now

Edit Makes sense now They can get rid of the cheapest price"
No usbc yet Apple is a joke
"Its so funny watching them sell the same phone

I wonder it all camera features will come to the 13Pro since its the same hardware essentially"
I thought we were gonna get a 
I was gonna get this if it didnt have a notch but now I just might upgrade my XS to a 13
"Im guessing that people dont want it to be eSim because it will be too much hassle to sell the phone in the 2nd hand market or use the phone abroad with a carrier from the country you visit

Am I right on my assumptions"
And the prices fr Europe are just incredible 1000 for the cheapest model which is basically the same as last years model
Is there a point in buying iPhone 14 or should I buy 13 or 13proif price drops in budget
I used to buy a new iPhone every year just for the few interesting innovations it would bring Last year with the 13 Pro was the first time in many years that I didnt upgrade I figured I would upgrade this year with 14 Pro but Im having a hard time seeing anything exciting here either I might get one anyway but its not very thrilling is it
Funny how they keep bullshiting about saving the earthrecycle shit while giving USBC is the most efficient way to reduce ewaste from all that extra cable and adapter
"Apple shot themselves in the food yesterday Bigtime failure  hope people will not buy iPhone 14 and they wont do these stupid things next time

The pro version should have been the normal one  they hold too many features for the PRO now making this one a crap

Even in the mostpositive sub ever this one people are not happy with these models wonder why 

Hope last years chip is not gonna be a trend but more likely a chip shortage and it wont happen next year But theyre starting many stupid trends recently  the iPad app drawer that works only on the newest models no USB typec and so on"

My apologies to anyone who might have been looking for something useful I had posted in the past Perhaps you can find your answer at a site that holds its creators in higher regard"
So esim is gonna be a thing now Hmm not sure if I like this or not I like having the ability to just pop my sim on a new phone
The fact that the base iphones start at 800 and 900 respectively yet they dont even have 120hz displays is absolute bs Cmon apple even 300 android phones have 120hz displays it does not even need to be ltpo for fk sake
To be honest the 14 Plus is really perfect for those who wants the Pro Max sized iPhone but doesnt require the best internals or material used My dad is definitely one of them he loves his iPhone 12 initially but hes now wishing it could be bigger but doesnt require the specs of a Pro Max iPhone
Im happy Steve Jobs didnt witness this bullsht
Hard pass Nothing truly innovative to make me upgrade from my 12 Pro Max
No USBCIm out
So we are going with AX1 chips for non pro models going forward This is what lack of competition does to a MF
I have the 13 pro and I love it Ill upgrade once Apple moves to usbc
These are just renamed iPhone 13  Wut
" No WiFi 6E
 No USBC
 No 2TB
 No SIM card my company has SIMs mandatory actually a set of SIMs depending on target country for the business trip
 No bigger sensor for the telelens just a larger lens
 The 2x zoom with the main 48MP cam is a native 12MP sensor crop using 14 of the entire sensor 48412 Quality will suck

x200B

Looking at the Pixel 6 the photos it takes are amazing The videos suck though  
I definitely will pass this years IPhone and keep my IPhone 13pro   
But I seriously consider to switch to the Pixel 7 this year if they step up in their video game"
"Everybody complaining about this needs to understand the iPhone 14 is a decoy model Decoy pricing is used in marketing to push people into upgrading to a more expensive device Heres a really solid blog article about ithttpsprisynccomblogdecoypricing The 14 is lackluster because they want you to buy a 14 Pro It exists to highlight how good the 14 Pro is and shorten the distance in pricing between the two with an expansive list of nextgeneration features that are and this is the important part outwardly very visible

Apple doesnt want a compelling option in the midrange lineup not that the iPhone 14 and iPhone 13 arent compelling They want 7 out of 10 or more iPhone users to be using a Pro

This is Apples move to marginalize and kill nonpro iPhones I expect they will be very successful"
Did they accidentally play the iPhone 13 video This looks the exact same pointless upgrade hoping the pro models are way better
Lmao this was the most mundane and disappointing iPhone announcement Literally the same as the 13 lineup
"Same chip same design

Common Apple L"
Caron Thor is now my new favourite apple employee please tell me she has a pet named Mjolnir
nice to see a bigger nonpro phone can finally upgrade my moms old phone
Loving the soft colours The blue and purple are super subtle Feels like weve been fading year after year and Im all for it
"I had to stop watching for work

Did they say a price"
Theres simply nothing like iPhone 14 Except iPhone 13
Kinda bummed the mini is officially gone
"The price increase in Europe is huge The 13 61 started at 909 the 14 61 starts at 1019 


Edit And the 13 didnt even get a 100 decrease it still starts at 909"
ok but why doesnt the 13 Pro with basically the same camera system and processor support Photonic engine and Action mode in iOS 16 I see no reason why it wouldnt
Anyone have an idea when the iPhone 13 price will drop in the UK
"In Italy the starting price for the iPhone 14 base model is 1029 euros

I am having a really tough time understanding wo would buy this instead of an iPhone 13 which is basically the same phone which can be had new for 789 euros"
No mini no thank you
Apples like how do we piss off people who travel a lot and need the SIM card slot Thats right lets remove it just like we removed the head phone jacks People will still love us for it no worries
Can someone list the actual differences between this and the iPhone 13
EU prices are a dealbreaker for me I now wait for the SE4 to retire my 6S Plus If that is also an abnormally expensive device I might even look at the Google Pixel camp
"The 14 Plus model is going to sell like hotcakes at 899 with the most important aspects of the 13 Pro Max and the new camera battery and connectivity features on top 

The 14 itself is a more minor upgrade outside of camera improvements and battery and connectivity but is still solid for those upgrading less frequently"
why was the advertisemens song saying the n word surely Im not the only one who noticed that
In my shitty Eastern Europe country the price for pro max is 1530 usd xD what is this
Wake me up when they decide to use USBC instead of lightning
Guys  Dont waste your time on the 14 and 14 Plus Just get a used or refurbished 13 Pro or 13 Pro Max for cheaper 
bruh their trailer literally says the nword like 100 times
Holy shit THAT is a creative way to use the pill cutout
Its the same as last year and youre gonna love it
Lmao the us event doesnt even have a sim tray 
Looks like Im keeping my 12 pro for another year 
No sim is a huge miss i run dual sim in my pro max its legit my favorite thing about the phone Guess Ill be hanging in to it
I know damn well they didnt take away the sim tray
Does anyone think we may shift to 2 yr cycles for iPhones sometime in the future This is basically the same as the 13 pro just with no physical sim Might make sense for Apple to shift to 2 yr upgrade cycles especially given their shift to a focus on services
"Still waiting for the Pro

Normal 14 is a disappointment"
wtf
This is the worst one yet Literally no selling features either
"eSim only and the same a15 chip

YIKES"
Basically an iPhone 13 pro without the ProMotion display
Its the iPhone 5C all over again but this time its more expensive rather than slightly cheaper
The entire show was talking to shareholders about why they shouldnt sell their stock the number of times they said these devices are essential shows they are gearing for the recession and trying to control the conversation about why they remain a good stock buy
Not much updates it seems which is okay
"REMOVING SIM TRAYS IS 100 DEAL BREAKER  When traveling internationally it is often required to buy a cheap local SIM to get cell service  I also swap back and forth between my nice phone and a burner phone when traveling to reduce theft risk  This alone is a total 100 deal breaker for me  I travel internationally every year and its already very difficult to get a sim in a foreign country in a foreign language  imagine trying to buy and troubleshoot an esim in a foreign language

Also I regularly swap between my main iphone 13 pro and an old iphone 7 with no apps to technology detox"
My 12 is kind of crapping out so I wanted a new phone but this definitely will have me getting a 13 once the prices drop lmao
This is my upgrade year every 4 years and I really dont know if I should upgrade from my XR Really would prefer the A16 but I dont have real use cases for the higher priced 14 Pro Dangit Apple
"Holy shit they are still refusing to go USBC not even on the Pro in fucking 2022 

Im seriously considering getting an Android phone Thats just insane Ive been waiting since 2017 for a device that has 100hz and USBC 5 years later and Apple still fails to deliver"
LOL they are acting like they invented what starlink is doing with Tmobile except Apples version is worse
LMFAO
Im gonna riot if they call it the 14 Pro Max
No mini Count me out
Holy shit the pro looks sick
the Dynamic Island is a clever way to work around the notch The integration of other apps is smart
Im sure this will be a profound upgrade that revolutionizes smart phones Definitely not just a miniscule upgrade at a steep price
I bet theyre switching to a new feature release on iPhones where the New iPhones will have last years pro model SoC and the Pro models will get the real new SoCs
"I get the newest phone every 4 years and this year was the 4 year mark iPhone XS Max is still running strong Guess Ill change in 5 years 

Edit Wait they are showing the 14 Pro Might change my mind"
iPhone 10 v4
removed
I have a iPhone 13 max and had iPhones since iPhone 5 This is the first time I genuinely did not give a shit that Im behind a number Lmao
The Sim Card Tray follows the headphone jack and charging brick
Did anyone have SIM card removal on their bingo card
"Im on iPhone 7 Plus and wanted to upgrade to the 14

I guess Im getting the 13 then if theyre exactly the same"
The Plus is going to sell like hotcakes That will further entice people who dont want the Pro to upgrade
"Apple Watch Ultra 
iPhone 14 Plus
iPhone 14 Pro Max 

Wheres the consistency"
Am I the only person thinking that last actual upgrade and excitement was iPhone X Im on 11 pro max now and dont feel any need to upgrade and Im a heavy user
No WiFi 6e is pretty lame considering its on a good amount of androids already
Who tf is going to spend 900 on the 14 plus Especially with the 60hz screen and chip from last year
No pro motion display Lol
Watch gruber and the other apple journos say how amazing this device is without pointing out its literally the exact same
Great 
I am whelmed
Does it have more RAM at least If not might as we just get a 13
Guys this is just an entry point for people who dont have iPhones if youre looking for tech and spec go for the pro model thats it
I have a 13 Pro but damn does that Dynamic Island and always on display look awesome Young me would have instana purchased when preorders go live buy older me says you dont need any of those features they are just super cool
"iPhone 14 Plus A iPhone XR with newer features better camera night mode AND a 67 screen instead of 61 

Ill take one"
"Ugh 
I got a 13 pro last year and now I want a new phone already

I cant do this every year I gotta wait at least 1 more year

Edit I do not plan on upgrading I am just a victim of FOMO I usually go years between buying iPhones
I had an XR before getting the 13 pro last year I dont expect to get a new phone until the 15 or maybe even 16 if the 15 doesnt excite me"
So many people overhere complaining about same chip Just chill pro will get newer chip 
All day battery  LOL
"Apple Watch Ultra is just Samsung Watch yet it still cant properly sync phone calls texts still dont clear when you do an action on the phone still has a trash keyboard Its all health upgrades

The iPhone itself claims to have the industry standard for pictures Thats a scam Im taking better photos on my s21 ultra than I did on my 13 pro max and iPhone still has a trash zoom

But hey They finally got lock screen widgets 10 years later

I love both sides for their own reasons but Im sick of apple and their fuc boys claiming everything is innovative game changing industry standard when all they are doing is finally catching up to android from 4 years ago You pay for the name Thats really it"
"Without USB C its not worth getting unless you absolutely need a phone Its basically good for one year The SE became a better deal since it has the A15 and finger print reader I prefer it to getting blasted with invisible light all the time but they didnt lower the price at all I was hoping 

Come on Apple give us USB C already Rumor is its coming NEXT go around Like it was supposed to be here THIS go around"
The plus and pro oh boy
What Space Harrier wannabe game was on display 
Finally tthey going to make something different between normal iPhone  Pro models
Why they explaining crash detection again
They didnt talk about materials or did I miss it Glass back Aluminum
Was that an Idris Elba song
Bruh they ended up with There is nothing like iphone 14
"So question now

x200B

Upgrade from iPhone 8 to 13 or to 14 lol"
Gonna be fun to justify the EU prices after a nearly nothing update
Well Im happy because my back market iPhone I need will now be cheaper
Always on display on the pro version
"At least they didnt call the iPhone Plus the iPhone Max as rumors suggested

That would have been confusing since Pro  Max according to the M Series chips"
If it has the same processor what exactly is different about it
Plus
Was that the iPhone 13 Mini still being sold in the last shot with the pricing
Our Chinese friends have stopped making small displays enjoy your bigger battery anyway
Ive never seen Apple look so flat about announcing their own product It was clear that all of the energy was for the higher end models
Lmao that was whelming at best
This is the first iPhone thread that Ive seen thats been mostly negative But yeah I agree its like a stripped down version of the 13 Pros
Moores law starting to peak Apple marketing is going to be working hard in the coming years to keep consumers buying slightly better models
I hope the new Ios can close all opened apps at once Coming from android to Iphone and finding out you cant do this is ridiculous
 Comedy show
How many more iPhone models until they implement USBC
The iPhone 13 caught flak for not being much improved over the 12 but now I foresee a big rush to buy them after this debacle
iPhone 14 is truly bizarre to me crash detection and satellite location are nice and the camera updates are always welcome but theyre not 14 Pro level so who tf is this for because to me it sounds like a slightly beefed up iPhone 13 that comes in a slightly bigger size if you want it
Looking at the tech specs this is officially the first iPhone since 2009s iPhone 3GS to not support CDMA since US carriers are shutting down their legacy CDMA networks this year
"What exactly the lenses are on 14 pro

On their website it states 4 lenses yet physically there are only 3 

Pro camera system

Sapphire crystal lens cover"
Lol I came here to read about all the people complaining who will instantly order the new phone still 
Does anyone know what happened to the 13 pro max on the website
the photos they show on their website is clearly taken with a  camera yet they claim its been taken by iPhone Only fools would believe thay
"I have XR hoping for smaller notch

I honestly dont like the color options that they have here"
does anyone know if always on display is an iphone 14 feature only or will it be available on older devices once ios16 is available
"And they literally killed the 12 mini

Only 13 mini available to buy new "
I still have the Xr
"might go on the 14 finally 

x200B

In canada the 13 is only 100 less then the 14"
Seeing that Apple kept the A15 chip for the 14 series phones makes the a used iPhone 13 more appealing Im seeing used 14minis for 450 on eBay might have to pull the trigger and upgrade my wifes 8
iPhone Pro from now on will have the latest chip while the iPhone will have the chip from previous year
Am good with my S10 plus No thanks
Why does the non pro has better audio battery life
The fact that the plus version needs a whole ass month to come out I just want an iPhone without the massive camera and they have to make it so hard 
As someone whos needing to upgrade the iPhone7 plus Ive been using for the past 7 years should I just get the iPhone 13 Pro or go ahead and get the 14 Pro
interesting
"So I must now be 3 years deep in mysecondhand iPhone Xreplaced battery last year but it has been hella slow over the last week or so Shock horror 

Anyway I do really like that Dynamic island stuff although I dont think it would change my life I was in the Apple Store recently and honestly the main one I think Id change to would be a secondhand iPhone 13 mini Looking at the comments though it seems thats no longer on sale Guess I might look for an iPhone 13maybe Pro again second hand"
Yeah the esim threw me but for me the apps I use even with my MacBook etc going android is no big deal Because of this keeping the iPhone 13 pro max and will probably get the S23 ultra when it comes out for my second phone keep this No iPhone 14 this round Plus the camera upgrade is not as big of a deal as they proclaimed Bigger upgrade will be next year and hopefully the apple store will sell an unlocked international version If not no big deal
Wheres the 90hz refresh rates though
Killed the Mini and instead added a 14 Max Sooo was there market research completely wrong when they released the Mini or what happened
Literally iPhones have no actual useful mew features keep removing stuff that and making incessant changes Seems like every year the biggest is a better camera
Holding onto my 13 till typec comes on the iPhone which I hope is in the 15
Will the new ceramic screen negate the need for a screen protector Came out with iPhone 12 I believe so I dont have experience with it Im most concerned about keys etc in the pocket scratching the display like they have with my iPhone 11
Time for me to get the 13 Pro Max then
looking at the spec there isnt to much difference from my 12 to the 14
Wow same phone again repackaged yay
Ignoring the Plus model for a minute whats the difference between the regular 13 and regular 14
As the proud owner of an iPhone 13 mini with an A15 and a SIM card tray Im happy that I got my mini when I did and Im sad to see that the 14 has no mini no SIM and the 13 Pros chip
I know that as time goes on phone upgrades are getting more incremental but I at least expected incremental This is essentially the same phone at the same price They definitely are trying their hardest to get people to go let the Pro model It surprises me with that in mind that they didnt increase the price of the Pro model as expected
"Why the hell they refuse to add touch id in power button as in ipads I regularly unlock my iphone without even raising it to have short glimpse I do not trust face id
Also where the hell is usbc"
Even tho its overpriced in my country I still think Im gonna buy it because my iPhone X already have crashed screen and back I dont want to wait another year meh
This is great news If it were 2020 again Keep copying and trying to catch up crapple
I was really hoping they would make the jump to USBC this year Oh well
Still no USBC
Im glad theres no inflation price increase
Starting at 1000 in Germany 
The lightning port lives on another year
"The notch integration with UI is pretty smart but not a big reason to buy it really   
Top features I think that are good  
Action mode is pretty cool but im sure there are apps available its good to be integrated  
Satellite mode is really good but not for everyone who will most likely be in cities   
The camera upgrade is intense but how much more quality does one need when just taking simple memories 

Overall not a good reason to buy only unless your 3 years old on your phone "
iPhone upgrade program not showing the iPhone max option why
Every one please order the purple So that I can get my space black 14 pro easily
What about the US unlocked version of the 14 will that have a SIM tray Im currently on the 12 pro max and to order the 14 pro max but Im on my bosses plan Typically Id just swap the SIM card but what do I do now
Does anyone really feel the alternate fonts for the clock actually look good Remind me of those cringey android skins from 10 years ago
I was interested to see what they came up with at the unveiling but I think Ill skip this year and stick with my 13 Pro
People who have had the iphone 1213 pro max vs iphone 1213 Is the screen size really that much bigger I wanted to upgrade from my 12 mini because i love it but its just to small for the stuff i do on it on the go Should i get the 13 or get the 14 plus to get the extra 06 inch screen
He Yea bring ing back the S model and selling us the same shit again woohoo
iPhone 14 max predictions should have been correct and not incorrect as only the name differ mods
I was hoping they were going to get rid of textured matte glass on the back Ill just keep my 12 pro max until it dies
iPhone 13 is kinda vintage now lol
Same as last year this is the phone marketed to people who havent upgraded in years Its not meant for the guy who just got the 13 last year
ARRRRGGGGHHHHH NO USBC damn you apple
I decided to get the Z Fold 4 instead
Such a boring release Apple peaked and the punch out is basically the notch
Im actually curious to know this one thing since US models have no sim tray but outside of US theres still is a sim tray does that mean the US models get bigger battery with that unused space What will they use that space for
Im so disappointed in the watch I was really hoping for a change in design
So this update has the one thing i truly wanted and that was 4k cinematic mode i do a lot of recording so the camera is the main draw for me I really do like the notch idea and turning that into a great mutli tasking tray it was always something i felt was holding phones back just being able to simply tap when listening to music to simply switch songs i know you can swipe but its not quite the same i like having the info at a glance The price is an absolute killer so if i do update to this i wont update to another phone for years but ill sell the 12 pro max and grab the 14 pro cause im wanting to go back down to a smaller size
"No physical SIM on the US models

Hello darkness my old friend
iPhone 44S

Ive come here again  to ruin your day"
"Honestly aside from saving money there is no reason why anyone should be buying the base iphone and not the non pro varients

Ridiculous that apple basically strong arm you into spending more to get the new features and newer processors now Whats the fucking point of using last years chip in this years model"
I have the 12 pro max Ill upgrade to the 14
999 starting price 
I currently have an 11 Ill be upgrading sooner rather than later By October
IMO the 14 isnt worth it Barely an upgrade over the 13  Pro series To rub insult into anyone looking to buy the phone in the states no SIM card Im grandfathered in that if I attempt to change anything on my plan I would be charged almost double the amount of what Im paying now So eSIM is off the table Then there no USB C which I was kind of hoping for but expect Apple to be like nope you get lightning There also fact that they pulled all 13 Pro models off the market because they knew the phones be exactly the same So yeah Im not a happy camper with a dying iPhone XS
I was planning on jumping from a 12 to 14 but I dont see any advantages of switching to a 14 when it is essentially a 13S
Was looking to upgrade from my SE might just get the 13 instead for 125 USD cheaper than the 14 I can probably pile on more discounts in a couple of months
i think minis gonna make a return for people whos holding back maybe in 23 years and Tim  thinks youre gonna love it
Pretty disappointed with Apples offerings this year
Can anyone here convince me to upgrade from an 11 Would love to upgrade if I can justify it other than just being new
Meanwhile Im still using an iPhone 6  yikes
"I hopefully doesnt touch reddit users to scream at my comment I think the 14 Plus and Pros are great Definitely they hyped up so much for the features but who doesnt It is quite exciting to see Androids existed features get refined more like the interactive notch bigger but also more clarity A brighter screen with a display engine The A16 chip is not far from A15 but still an improvement and more efficient Overall it is not innovative however the features they brought is greatly refined Looking for an upgrade iPhone 13s are still wonderful value an the family If no money budget and you have no constrains the 14 pros are good to go unless the features doesnt make a difference to you then the 13 pros are still on salesomewhere Anyway I think 14 pros reveal is exciting 14s are just a 13v2
Edit This is my genuine thoughts I got more excited in reality but Im scared of people calling me dumb or something Okay the removal of the sim card tray is ridiculous"
Apple hasnt convinced me to buy an iPhone since the iPhone 5S
"One thing I dont see anyone talking about in regards to the dynamic island is how much smudge will accumulate Youre constantly pressing tapping and holding the same area of the phone

Not to mention how far will you have to stretch your thumbs to reach it on the pro max versions"
"fuckit





























"
"This year we can have the Large size without having to go mandatorily to the Pro Max version I know the 14 Pro Max is the best but for a given budget would you pick the 14 Plus or the 14 Pro no max  
  
I watch a lot of videos and battery life is also important I make horrible photos whichever the phone I have So Id goy for the 14 Plus but would I miss the Dynamic Island"
iPhone 13 Pro Junior
Why would anyone buy this over the pro max
Planning to buy one iPhone 14 will it be worth or waste
Now that we know there is a new iphone how long does it normally take for all the other phones to be discounted
Dogshit
Theres still gonna be people buying it Its a nice phone cool its bigger with nice theme but its still the same phone regardless the version
My X needs to be replaced but I see no zero reason to buy a 14  Ill just pick up a 13 somewhere and wait to get the 15 with hopefully USBC
Is it worth getting the 750 trade credit for a 13 pro max to get to a 14 pro max
Oh yes iphone 14 plus buying a downgraded iphone 13 pro max for the same price  MAGICAL
Im surprised they havent announced a foldable yet
Looks like Ill be holding onto my 12 Pro for a while longer
Was really hoping they add peer to peer wireless charging
Do we think dynamic island will eventually be on all iPhone models Or will that always be a Pro only feature
"Lmao currently viral on Twitch Pretty funny

httpsclipstwitchtvShyGoldenWaffleRiPepperonis75PvhsRCULS9ifBN"
"They must sell it somehow
Last years iphone 13 pro and pro max will be a much better deal than the 14"
Last year we invented the best processor everand this year you basic bitches get to enjoy it again and Tim think youre going to love it
And no sim tray is a feature I mean I use esim and I travel a lot so thats something that will be very inconvenient I might have to hold onto my 13 Pro Max a while longer then which thankfully is a very good phone
iPhone has officially peaked
"Since iPhone 14 has the same SoC as the iPhone 13 Pro I do wonder if well see 4K cinematic mode for the 13 Pro in a future update 

Probably not though right"
For real
"bro its the A15 BIONIC

x200B

I think

x200B

Other than that uh  yeah  seems like mostly theyre heavily focusing on software revamping the inner workings to make it harder to fix no doubt and The environment Im laughing my ass off at this one"
I have a 13 and I had to google to see if my processor as the A14 or this A15 bionic was new and my was only the regular human A15
Its not the same chip though but wtv just ignore that
They could have said more ram as iPhone 13 to make it feel faster Thats something
Is it still 60hz
Im surprised they put as much emphasis on it as they did thought they were going to just be like oh yeah it still has last years SoC and then quickly move on
Is has A16 chips
Hopefully they are just taking a break for a few years and theyll bring it back  I love my 12 mini so much
Maybe it will come back as a new SE
You wanted a small phone but didnt buy enough As punishment were making it extra large this time
I left android for apple specifically because of the mini If they stop making it thats going to suck Fuck big phones
Dozens of people will be disappointed
"thats why i went ahead and bought one just the other day 

Sad no one makes a good small smartphone these days outside of the now extinct 13 mini"
Yeah or theyll do a mid year release Maybe the next iPhone SE will be essentially the iPhone 14 mini
This is the only reason Im on iOS Looks like Im back to Pixel in a year or two
Long live the mini
Willing to bet it comes back as the new SE  developing the tooling to create an entirely new device is not cheap and theyll keep it around as long as possible
Anddd iiiiwill alwaysLoOVe YouuuUU 
"I mean what are you gonna do download emulators lol



 Tim probably"
When people think of intense gaming they think Apple
The entire keynote this year was gen z inspired cringe statements lmao There was even that part where they cut to Tim and he does a little jump like he wasnt ready Kinda sloppy
Yup kill me pls
Dude in Poland pro max costs 1530 usd xDdD
"Euro depreciated a bit against the dollar And apple will die before reducing margins 
So fuck the consumer it is Whatre we gonna do anyways Buy an android s"
Probably weakening of the Euro
14 Pro also costs 1300 euros
Because the US dollar is crushing the Euro
No offence but Plus is a terrible name for the new phone All it gets is a bigger screen as far as Im aware S22 gets more additional features from S22 other than a larger display
EUR plummeted in the past year
EURUSD Exchange rate and sales tax
Base model 14 starts at 1050 in Norway The 13 is also somehow more expensive now than a month ago when I bought mine thank fuck I bought mine a month ago
The Euro weakened so much that its now basically the same as a US Dollar Prices have also risen in the UK since the Pound has depreciated as well
Seriously Wow I like Apple but I will never spend more than 800 for a new iPhone There isnt even a 14 mini any more  Their greed is getting worse and worse
It slots the internals of the 13 Pros basically I mean I guess its a smart way to keep using those chips over time
im confused I need a new phone and have an dying 11 currently What you recommend I go for
They also introduced a larger form factor for the regular phone Thats a huge deal for a lot of people
discounted 13 Pro Max on Amazon are gonna be sick deals pretty soon
"And jack up the price

Every time I upgrade it feels like theres nothing new Ill just buy iPhone 13"
"Ive got 2 Sim Cards in my S22U atm and they are both in each dedicated tray This is because both operators I use dont support eSim

I dont think theyll take these away anytime soon as it will upset operators especially virtual ones

On a side note Ive had an eSim before and tbh I dont like it It was a pain transferring the eSim from one phone to another That could depend on each operator though I had to wait 2 days for a Sim Swap kit to be posted out to my home It was literally a QR code to scan my plan onto the new phone "
Wouldnt mind the sim being gone but I would really love some microsd trays back
Dont worry wont happen for ages most of Europe wont adopt this for awhile and android is huge there Apple just did this for control this isnt a leap in technology as far as removing the sim tray Its just to lock you in more and use carrier overseas roaming packages
eSIM isnt a new concept RAZR was the first to remove the tray and that was back in 2020 But funny you think Apple is somehow ahead of the times by doing so
What value does the tray have over esim
They epoxyd the physical SIM slots for Americans China of course still gets the SIM physical slots plural yes two
Apple moment 
Technically the camera is better both back and front and you dont have sim tray anymore and the whole satellite thingie I think thats it
Seriously what a dud
In Europe its 100 more
"Basically the 13 with a slightly brighter screen and the 13 pro main camera  better processing


 the bigger size Since they view non pro customers as different"
Theyre selling it for 2025 more in some European markets the old full price wouldve been way better
Pretty sure the 14 has 2 years of emergency satellite service
The Plus model seems more interesting news for those who had to buy the Max for the size
That is their way
I mean honestly how much more features can you add
This isnt the early 2010s anymore Were starting to reach stagnation and the only thing that can be done from here is to find the smartphone replacement
Its definitely come to a point where almost no one needs to upgrade every year So even if its only a small upgrade year to year when you need a new phone in 35 years thats when youll see a difference in performance and features that of course arent locked behind just software
"I am gonna disagree there just because I think the phones are already unbelievably impressive if we just think about it for 30 seconds

I can access billions of webpages even from the backseat of a moving car I can take stunning pictures at a cost that is literally so cheap nobody even considered calculating the cost I have more pictures of my parents cute dog than of my self as a child

High quality video Video conferences with my parents at any time It can pinpoint my location  almost anywhere on the fucking planet at any time I need to I can organize events with an entire group of people distributed across the planet at no cost

Merchant shipping empires could have been built on just the GPS feature alone The screen is better than the screen in my laptop just ten years ago

And all of this at a pretty small cost and available in our pockets

The phone is mindblowingly amazing if only we actually looked at it

Of course This update is not a big change from the previous one

But your phone is amazing"
Dont fix what aint broke
Well every year you have to fear that they remove another valuable feature Now the SIM tray is gone Next year it might be the physical port Smartphones get more expensive for a marginal gain
I suspect you mean the rate of change is slowing not that the phones are getting less impressive
True the real excitement is in the mid range market right now Especially outside western markets the mid range segment looks really attractive now
Yeah I kept my last iPhone for 3 years for the first time normally on a 2 year cycle but just wasnt worth it and the year gap between paying back a loan was more worth it
"Fellow iPhone mini fans

it has been a privilege and an honour

Insert musicians playing on Titanic meme"
Every Phone Manufacturer LEtS jUsT keEP making phones bigger than peoples pockets  
They still sell the 13 as well Im wondering what kind of moron would pay 20 more for the 14 when its this small of an upgrade
Should never have stopped with the S naming This is an iPhone 13s
Most advanced iPhone yet
Youre better off buying a refurbished 13 ProMax instead of a 14
"Only 3 hardware changes

1 New component layout inside
2 New satellite antenna thing
3 No sim card for US models LOL

So there is literally no way at all to tell the difference between a 14 and 13 physically outside the US"
Bit of an overreaction Apple updates looking the same is pretty standard at this point
Its 25x better
Same 
Except a bit heavier on some models backwards
Rip in peace
RIP in peace
131
"This is Apples first Minus series The iPhone 13 Minus

Its the iPhone 13 but without the physical SIM slot or a Mini screen option"
now im laughing at all these people guessing that the notch is rounded
Honestly the last time there was compelling reason to upgrade over 1 year was the iPhone 7 to the iPhone X Maybe iPhone 5s to 6 before that There rarely is a reason to upgrade every year
iPhone 13S
" lol no sim tray either

New Feature We took away a feature thetrollfacejpg"
" no sim tray either 

I mean we knew it was coming eventually when they allowed 2 active eSIMs with 13 Apple was always first in removing hardware slots they consider nonessential 

Since its only US for iPhone 14 its probably a testrun to see how its received Also a big warning shot for carriers all around to world to allow for eSIM soon or they wont be able to service iPhones in the future Which will kill their business"
The best feature is the relay centre used for emergency services
In Europe its still here but I am afraid that wont last long sadly
The lack of sim tray must be a US thing The UK version defo still has it on the 14 and the 14pro You can view them in AR on the Apple store app and look at all sides
" edit lol no sim tray either All downgrades

How is that a downgrade  One phone multiple phone numbers if wanted easier to add carriers if traveling one less piece that can break etc  eSim is definitely an improvement"
Do you expect major upgrades every year
Watch and Airpoda are cool
Yeah like they were loook It lasts a daaayyyyy Wtf is wrong with them
14 Pro was hype as fuck iPhone 14 was very underwhelming and Watch series 8 is pretty boring too and before someone replies no Im not sexist its just kinda a lame upgrade
Quick roll another insanely expensive flashy product video that will be obsolete by next year
And how many years has it been since the chip inside really made a noticeable difference
A16 go to pro
You act like they dont take the pro chip from the previous model and put it in the lower end phone for the current models IIRC they do that every single year
WHERE IS MY IPHONE FLIP DAMMIT
No USBC is rapidly becoming the new 16gb base storage bullshit that lasted 4 years longer than it should have
Lmao damn Keeping my 12
Yeah no usbc is basically a deal breaker for me Definitely switching to Android when I can So annoying that between an iPad  iPhone I need two cables
If you saw a single leak here you would know that no one these were supposed to happen for 14th its been talked about since the start of the year
Yeah this wont be the year I upgrade from the 11 Pro
Not a notch  a dynamic island 
Really seems like this shouldve been the year for USBC given the lack of new CPU form factor etc
"still has notch

Yall have been griping about this since 2017 Have you gotten bored of beating the same dead horse on a yearly basis yet"
Even worse notch
They said you can have multiple esims active at once Would that not meet your current use case
What you going to do when most other manufacturers follow suit
Yep my contract ends in July I will either stay with my iPhone 12 or just go get the new Pixel if it isnt completely bugged Need also two Sims
I dont think its massively anti consumer its just where the tech is headed and should help improve the implementation
They literally said you can use two sims in a phone and switch back and forth
Whats the reason for using dual sims I know very little about sims but I thought it was one per phone
Its so your carrier can sell you roaming packages at an absurd price in spain you can get a 10gb sim for 5euros or 30gb for 15euros and now your carrier will sell you 1gb for 15 if you are lucky and a well touristed area queue gasp if you go somewhere less so think kenya or bali
Get an older phone or a backup phone I guess for travel
The iPhone 13 had a physical SIM slot and a Mini option
There was no price increase tho
NO APPLE FLIP PHONES YET IS REALLY WTF Thats what I was hoping for
i tried but the battery was too bad
I am on the 6 Waiting until USBC is implemented as well
I wish they gave us a warning before phasing it out so I can renew it then
Not enough people bought it 
There is an iPhone 14 mini its called the iPhone 13 mini
Wanna see when people would start thinking the iPad mini is the perfect sized phone
Im still hoping itll come back for 15 or 16
It wasnt selling well I know theres a niche group of people that absolutely love the form factor but it wasnt selling as they had hoped
Right I dont want to carry a BRICK in my pocket
SE and lack of pro mini together cannibalize mini sales
You will be shocked when you google ESIM and see how many options there are I travel constantly and use it constantly Its cheap and super effective
Cricket can do eSIMs now and they are ATT prepaid as an MVNO Its still a call or visit system though at the moment since they only added the option last month
Only in the US right
Mint Mobile They have eSim
Same  Going to try and find a discounted 13 pro max now
Most consumers wont care The group of people who regularly swap sims might but Id imagine very few people swap sims on a regular basis
I know a few people here who use eSIM I havent looked back personally
Spoiler It will
With the  current geopolitical I think it will
but like for what activity is the A15 not more than enough are you constantly exporting 4k 60fps hdr videos while playing genshin impact at max settings theres absolutely no perceptible difference between these two processors
Its our most rugged iPhone ever
And Tim thinks you are going to like it
Pressed the upvote button using one hand
Apple just cant figure out under display fingerprint or is simply too stubborn to understand that the notch is ugly
Yep Ill keep my iPhone X for one more year for sure
"Being environmental isnt an all or nothing proposition  Are they perfect No  Do they do some things that reduce environmental impact  Yes  Are they better than most big corporations  As far as I know yes

Until you are perfect in your own life stop holding others to an impossible standard  

Also batteries can be recycled even when a product is not userrepairable  Youre conflating two issues"
Isnt the launch price 100 more
Well you cant compare the base model with Pro models
iPhone 15 better be amazing I wouldnt be surprised though if its just a iPhone 14 with 1 more Battery Life and a 01 inch Bigger screen whoaaa 
Hope the iPhone 15 is a Flip phone before my ADHD ass goes to Samsung lol
But sadly not that much
The 14 is 13 but chiller The plus is when the 13 and Pro had a baby but the baby lost most of daddy pros features
Hong Kong models have two SIM slots with none of the weird system changes lol
but less than 13pro no 120hz screen or telephoto lens unclear if it got 2 extra gigs of ram or not
They have ALAC though
This right here iPhone 1213 mini is perfect size for me All the normal models are too big and thats where theyre starting now Really sad
Unfortunately the Mini didnt sell like gangbusters Too bad Apple got rid of it for the minority of people that liked it
There are android manufactures who make actually small phones like the Jelly Bean Sadly it has potato camera but other than that it at least exist
"Dont worry youll be okay

Lol people just dont get it do they

The next step will be portless It isnt rocket science"
The live stream for Apple showed that theyre now using USBC
Yea like we put the 13 pro in the basic 14 but f you proraw and cinematic mode will stay disabled
for the Pro and Pro Max only
Its coming
I have an XS and Im planning on replacing the battery It should hold me over until an actual refresh I dont take many pictures and the only thing I would like is 120hz screen
Might be correct on the 2nd hand market but I used to buy sims when I travelled now I just have Tmobile which has unlimited data and texts in 215 countries When I was in Europe earlier this year I went to 5 different countries and the data was fast enough to use maps make calls on whattsapp It was only slow for downloading apps which only happened once when I wanted to download a city bike app I would still like the option of a sim slot but I dont think I would ever use it A sim card is also old tech if you think about what it actually does
"13 will remain on the market

Buy the 13 Pro or max if the price drops some"
I recommend the 13
At least a couple hundred upfront for the unit and around 20month for the satellite service  Yeah this is pretty huge for the recreational hikeroutdoors person who may venture outside of cellular range from time to time but not often enough to justify getting a standalone satellite unit
Yes very awesome for the 00001 of all apple costumers who are ever going to use it
RIP my garmin inreach subscription
150 at a minimum plus service costs
Yea take that Garmin 
That is in point for sure A lot of people want bigger screen but will never use the upgraded cameras etc
I wanted this phone coming into today but without a new chip and the 120fps screen of the pro Not to mention the esim only and no usbc Ill wait another year on my XS Max
Same I have a family member that wants a bigger screen than the XR they have now Only way to go bigger is get Pro Max and the 13 is selling for about 900 used right now So a new 14 Plus seems to be the better way to go off screen size is the main consideration
Yeah I imagine playing this at that time First it is a wow Then show the rest it just give him the Apple disappointment he feared
Cyaaaaaaaa
people like you that bought an iphone are the exact reasons apple keeps using the lightning port
I was actually surprised at the lack of USBC I figured that was a slam dunk at this point
I actually think the 14 is a more compelling phone than the 14 Pro Honestly if you were deciding between a 13 pro and a 14 pro Id say get the 14
Eh The 7 announcement was worse for me
Pro will get different chip Just chill 
They dont need to reinvent the wheel every year man The phones design is fine how it is tbh
starting at 799 plus is 899
350 
79900 
799 899 for the plus
"799

plus 899"
Same reason the 14 with 13 pro internals wont get proraw They want to software feature force you into the next one because the hardware has peaked
"Sure 
1Satellite Connectivity for SOS
2A15 with 5 GPU Coresame as 13 Pro now
3Crash Detection
4New Main Camera13 Pro Camera too
5Plus Model replacing mini with longer battery life
6New Colors
7Photonic Engine for better low light photos on all cameras
8New TrueDepth Selfie Camera with AF and Aperture for better in low light

Hopefully 6GB of ram too but Im not getting my hopes up"
Apple tax Apple always sets its selling price higher in developingweaker economy countries
Exactly Although I would like a Max model so maybe 13 Pro Max will be a good deal somewhere
"This comment and 8 year old account was removed in protest to reddits API changes and treatment of 3rd party developers

I have moved over to squabblesio"
you can still use dual sim standby with eSIM as long as both provides support eSIM
Amen xs brother
Waiting for USBC My X is still fine
"This 2 year cycle thing has been said for a while but its not happening If everyone was on the 13 then sure but thats not how it is 

Its for people further back looking for a new phone There are still many people with an X or 11 and for them it is an upgrade There will always be a large population of people with iPhones from a few models back So there will always be new models released"
"Nah since some people upgrade on even years some on odd some every 3 years etc

A model every two years would diminish sales a ton in year 2 of every product so theyd have to discount a ton only to release a new product With the current setup they can keep the last couple designs around for longer so that theyre not too old and discount each one a little bit"
Its not especially green telling people to buy a new device thats full of rare and environmentally relevant materials every year either
a person who upgrades every year too wont feel the same sense of change compared to the person upgrading every 35 years
And without proraw or cinema mode Wtf its literally the 13 pro internals Whats the excuse here
In what way The 5c and Xr are the two most embarrassing phones apple has ever released These phones are very average but theyre no where near the caliber of bad those phones were
Its the same every year We have to compare at least two upgrades for the changes to be noticeable
You can sign up for international roaming eSima though Its pretty quick just not cheap
same here
My wife experiences laggggg and freezing regularly I got 12Pro and have none of that So weird
"Yeah its really weird Is the apple version piggybacking on Starlink still I feel like theres no way a phone could reach the other geostationary satellites but I would have said the same thing about reaching Starlink satellites a few weeks ago

I guess they invented the message compression capability but geez"
What else are they going to call it
Nice
Ikr This is exactly the same as 13  11 to 12 to 13 all had significant changes Wtf is this
iphone 20 is just a raw A18 chip in a case If you want to see visuals or audio you need airpods and apple glasses
Or wait for the 15 and hope for USB C
Yup Go ahead and get the 13
Might as well I am on the 8 Plus and sticking to it Love the camera and I take videos very often
I still have the iPhoneX and Im thinking of upgrading just because its been a while and this one is starting to slow down a bit
Theyll sell so many of those phones you wont believe it Almost no one cares about the screen refresh rate
Absolutely not for 999 of users anyway Only you know if youre in that 01
Same thing I was thinking I loved the XR  I have ip 13 max and I dont like it I only bought it for the battery and now the plus has a big ass battery at a nice price ima get it
"these dont even look like they upgraded them same chip no usbc no promotion display same notch same form factor same camera placement 

your 13 pro is better than these 14s in every way

edit and they took away the sim tray hahaha"
bro it looks like its an iphone 13 but just slightly better
It essentially the same phone I dont get how anyone could be compelled to upgrade after a year but I guess youre the people Apple loves
"
I got a 13 pro last year and now I want a new phone already

Why"
How does that benefit ppl looking to buy the base model 
Expected comment from nft user
13 Duh
Wait for 15
Not really there is plenty of innovation in the phone hardware space Apple just isnt choosing to adopt newer tech
"None

Theyll go portless before adopting usbc on the phones"
Same thing that happens every year after they announce the new model it got removed
There is no more 13 pro
No The only way to prevent swirls and scratches is with a glass screen protector
Not much
The 13 mini accounted for 3 of the total iPhone 13 sales Down from 5 for the previous model Its a little surprising the 13 came in a mini after such poor performance the year before
It is everywhere except USA
It always will Apple makes WAY to much money off certifying lightning cables with companies like Anker and others
All US iPhone 14s have no sim tray
I like the sort of bolded one in white I think the others and that any other colours look like shit
just go hold one in a store thats the only way you could remotely know what will be best for you Try to not overcompensate though coming from the mini ask yourself if you really will value the large screen or youd rather have it more one hand friendly Theyre pretty wide phones
nothing will beat the jet black iPhone 7 anyways
honestly does it even matter at this point They made a great point that even the a13 from a few years ago outperforms the current flagship android processor If you really need the processing power that bad I would imagine its because you have a very specific use for your phone but for daily regular use the a15 is probably great Plus the differences between the devices need to be more significant I guess I dont know Either way the A15 is likely plenty powerful for most people
Whats wrong with that Im not native I dont get it
Glad I wasnt the only one who did a double take like Whatt
Lmao
xqcs face OMEGALUL
Gonna be interesting how they price the iPhone 13 Pro vs the iPhone 14
"13 Pro is no longer on the website Its not in the refurbished store either not yet atleast

They dont wanna sell it to us I ordered a 13 Mini instead 599 "
THe iPhone 13 is now 599 which is a far better deal than the 14
You basic bitches get to enjoy it again 
Its the best iPhone yet
Exactly Same issue I travel internationally and buy local sim This is just pain in the 
"New Feature We took away a feature

courage"
I guess it does at least force carriers to get on board with it
This is a huge blow to people who travel Setting up an E sim is not easy or consistent among different countries Shocking and disappointing decision on apples part
"A small PERCENTAGE of people use ESIM This alienates everyone who uses a carrier without esim Most prepaid carriers

So until those prepaid carriers adapt unlocked or prepaid sales will be slim"
esim
Yeah that is going to be interesting I dont think my current provider even supports eSims I am on the 13 so it will be a while before I upgrade
Yeah wtf Cant take my phone on travels anymore No way they got e sims in African countries just ready to go for international tourists
Meh the industry needs to be pushed to esim apple has given them years to do so
Only in the US as always
Nah I think lucky number 13 was the peak Between the A15 battery and promotion Its the perfect package
It peaked in 2017 honestly
iPhone X was the peak I have an XS and I really dont see why I need to upgrade They just keep making the camera better but anyone with half an interest in photography will get a DSLR
This is very true
WHERE IS MY IPHONE FLIP DAMMIT Bring back 2010 phones please
iPhone 14 nonPro has a weird hybrid of the 13 Pro SOCCPU but the 13 nonPro camera
Just like when the A12X became the A12Z in the iPad Pro they enabled an extra GPU core no other changes in two years
Last year was also A15 Bionic for the 13 lol
"Yeah its about as different as the A12Z was to the A12X

Hey guys we enabled a previously disabled core on the GPU Totally different chip"
"Even better when that Chinese lady goes on to sell us the A15 Bionic and all of its achievements

I mean lady were aware Weve had it for a year"
Imma upgrade from my 12 mini to my 13 mini any day now Gonna hold onto to that 13 mini as long as I can lol
Hoping the cost for parts will get low enough where it can be the next SE
The good news is that youll now be able to buy a small phone with the same exact chip of the iPhone 14 for a lower price when you need to upgrade
Im rockin my 12 mini til the wheels fall off 
They wont They discontinued it because of lackluster sales The next SE might use the 12 Mini body Or might not Who knows
I love the form factor but I hate the screen I can barely see anything on it when the sun shines and the battery is absymal
I pray
"SE is not for your benefit It is what left from what theyve order for iPhone 8 in large quantity Theyve replace its inner and sell them as Special Edition

Im not sure if they have extra part left for mini because theyve ditch it"
12 mini is dropped from the apple store So I hope it will soon become SE
SE Plus all the features of a regular SE but smaller and at a convenient higher price
Id figure a refreshed iPhone Xr would better fill that role tbh
Android hasnt had a decent small phone since the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact in 2015
Only reason I got rid of my X was for the smaller 12 mini Thinking of getting a 13 when the price inevitably drops to use as long as possible
Theyll probably update it every 2 years or so
Guess everyones moving to the Asus Zenfone lol
They stopped production on the 13 mini really quickly It was a phone a ton of people wanted but didnt buy
I did the exact same thing
Not many of us but the iPhone Mini is the single best phone Ive ever owned and Ill grab a 13 mini to hold onto until the end of time
Dont discriminize my small hands
True on handed operation light fits comfortably in my front pocket  Whats not to like  Battery life
iPhone Mini was fucking amazing Truly a shame
Im going to hold on to my iPhone 12 Mini for dear life now I was thinking about an upgrade so thanks to Apple for saving me the money
My small hands are very disappointed
Thats me 
Seriously though it makes sticking to my 13 mini for the next few years really easy If it was up to me it would be even smaller I like small phones and big ass tablets
13 mini isnt extinct 12 mini is
EU Digital Markets Act will be ratified in a month will probably shake that up
I meanyes lol I just played through the entirety of Metal Gear Solid 1 on my iPhone with my Backbone
AAApple is why its called triple A titles
Arent they the performance leaders on the mobile side though
I waited 1 year so I could get the 13 for 100 less but I guess that was time waisted 
My jaw dropped when I saw the prices too its like a 2025 increase ridiculous
"But it is on par now 1 Dollar is one Euro So Europe paid the same number even when the euro was way stronger and now Europe pays way more even if it is now on par

What logic is that"
if it got more features you will get people complaining that the small phone doesnt get the full features 
So they basically SEd the 13 Pro
13 on clearance at a carrier if you dont care about Pro Motion 1314 Pros if you do  the camera upgrades
iphone thorteen
Yeah if they want a Max without the Pro options or going fully pro
Samsung probably When it comes to this shit they have trended to follow Apple removing 35mm jack removing ability to replace battery
Samsung First theyll criticize it and then copy it 2 years later
Whats an eSim Is it literally just a virtual sim opposed to a physical one
"monkey paw curls

Laptops stop providing sufficient storage internally and expect you to use your own microsd cards"
Im enjoying the iPhone 13 pro max but will see what the s23 ultra will offer and will probably jump on that Plus Samsung has sweet trade ins on pre order so giving up the pro max on a trade in deal is in the cards The 14 is the same phone and the cameras are suspect its mostly software tweaking other than the 48mp on the pro which I believe wont make that a huge of a difference due to binning
"The thing is Apple removes a feature other companies mock Apple for removing the feature and then those companies remove the feature the following year 
Nobody thinks Apple is doing it first"
"Not all carriers support eSIM In particular many cheaper MVNOs in the United States as well as many international carriers There is a reason they didnt remove it from models sold outside the United States This move really hurts budget conscious users in the US as well as people who travel internationally

US carriers also dont handle eSIM that well and often force people to go to a carrier store to activate one It also adds another hurdle for those switching between iOS and Android"
Source
"	and the whole satellite thingie

If you live in USCan"
"Its EUR 999 for the iPhone 14 and EUR 799 for the 13 mini in Germany Its insane to think that it costs you a grand now to buy the entry level iPhone in Europe 

In the US the 14 starts at USD 799 Even with VAT which is 10 max it is a lot cheaper there"
This is sad but I think Europe will stabilise again soon
i realise people like crying but 800 2025 VAT is 1k euro
"always on display
promotion
microsd
usbc
more cameras
smaller notch

i know that these were basically all added to the pro model but the fact that these bare minimum features are getting added to the 1000 dollar phone is dumb"
Foldable displays with IOS would be cool if you ask me
"I want a camera that slides up like my old oneplus 7 pro No notch in the screen At all

I want big easy to use volume switches on the back like my old LG 4

And I want a fingerprint reader on the back in addition to the face scanning for when we all have to wear masks again

And I want them to use the extra space caused by the massive camera lenses to put in more battery so it can lie flat on a fucking table again"
Id genuinely rather have a portless phone than the same phone as last year with 1 new feature most people would never use
headphone jack
"One wouldve been enough usbc

It might sound petty but no usbc is the only reason why I will keep my 6S until the 15 and if that still doesnt have it then I guess android is the way to go"
Performance also all the pro features
Its insulting the base 14 models didnt even get ProMotion displays
I would love to have night sky photography over the air charging no notch functioning siri
I want a fucking FLIP IPHONE pleaseee Apple
Agree another disruptive technology next year
"I mean youre listing pretty basic smartphone features that an iPhone 6s running iOS 15 can pretty much do An iPhone X pretty much covers the modern interface and OLED box By the time you reach the 11 Pro the cameras are already fairly similar to todays phones Maybe a 12 for 5G and other niceties 

Basically weve truly reached peak smartphone People said this years ago and I had to disagree from an enthusiast POV but tbh I dont really see anything groundbreaking that will make me change how Im using the phone coming from a 12 Pro Max Definitely a bigger upgrade than the last few generations and nice to have but fundamentally its fast enough the camera and display are good enough that its going to be identical to 95 of people in daily use 

Its diminishing returns coming from a 2020 flagship Oh well maybe 2024 when they build even further on this new design"
"But your phone is amazing

From a technology standpoint absolutely but you also have to take the good with the bad

Those fancy camera upgrades every year Every teenager and young person thinks theyre a TikTok influencer or Instafamous

Wireless headphones connected to streaming music How many times have you seen people walking completely oblivious to everyone and everything around them

Social Media on your phone You can now interact with your cousin you havent seen in 20 years or the 2nd grade bully you never cared to see again or the random family member youve never even met Of course these interactions are mostly stupid crap involving politics or sports or religion but hey interaction 

Technology is cool but its also quickly becoming a cancer on society"
App integration yes but in a vaccum one ui is very close with a nice touch of customization and openess to it
If it aint broke dont slap a new name on it and sell it like it is fixed
The average phone size grew by about 33 since the iPhone 4 days but Im pretty sure the average size of our pockets or hands didnt really increase during the same time period
"Its around 30 Some countries have bigger adoption some smaller Depending how rich the country is 

I dont expect 14 to sell that well tbf Europeans gonna be happy if they pay for electricity this year"
Which I sort of feel is an iPhone 12S tbh 
Its even less of an upgrade than the S line use to be
Not even S series iPhones at least had a new processor
s stands for You wanted to keep the physical SIM sike
"The Pro cameras feel more like a dramatic upgradethe restnot so much aside from that dynamic island haha

Kind of makes me feel like its the iPhone 6S era where the cameras megapixel count went up and the body design stayed largely the same"
Phones dont evolve at a rapid year of year pace And particularly in the mid tier market most people arent looking to upgrade every year The 14 isnt for someone with a 13 and probably not for someone with a 12 But there are a lot of people with iPhone 7s and Xs that might be looking for an upgrade and this is a little bit more than last year Im curious to see how much better the battery is over the 13 and for many that may be enough
We think youre gonna love it again
Its 1 more advanced so we arent lying
"the best iPhone weve ever made

and we are taking whatever to the next level"
Is that gonna be better than the 14 Pro though
The camera upgrades seem very solid
the standard model is using the processor from the last years pro version as well
Not even new satellite antenna a communication satellite antenna already existed in the 13 it was just unused
NAME
Colours
"Every year I hear apple releases the same phone again and every year I hear I cant believe apple did exactly what everyone says they do

Smartphones are just boring now"
Yes and its a terrible thing Im keeping my 11 Pro still they introduce a real update and not the we made this thing 10 better and this thing gota 31 improvement
Not overreacting is exactly what they hope we do
122
For me its 129 considering they removed the sim card tray
"I personally would agree but some people need way less for a yearly upgrade

However i would add the jump from 11 to 12 if we are talking about the nonpro version It had 5G Ceramic Shield for the front Display MagSafe OLED Display Nightmode for the front camera

Definitely one of the biggest year over year jumps we have ever seen for nonpro Probably a bit too much given how 13 and 14 nonpro seem to stagnate"
"you are not wrong Iphone 1112 nonpro was such a massive upgrade that nonpro now seems to be stuck because they cant possible remove even more features from the pro series At some point pro aint even worth it 

However I feel like next year could be good for the normal one because the smaller notch with Dynamic Island has to come to nonpro No way they redesign the homescreen alerts that much for only a small part of the userbase"
"i mean skip generation only really applies to people staying on the newest iPhone every year If you come from older devices like 11 or 12 its just as worth as 12 and 13 had decent improvements you will also receive

My iPhone is companyissued and we get new ones every 3 years Im due for next August meaning i will receive a 14 aswell But given im coming from 11 14 is fine Although i would say slightly unlucky because im fairly convinced the smaller notch and Dynamic Island will come to the normal iPhone next year Its just too good to stay on PRO"
"Hey its so bothersome to MANUALLY SWAP the SIM every year

If you can afford it Lmao gottem"
"The floppy The compact disc The jack

All removed by Apple Your phone could have a floppy drive if it wasnt for that evil Tim Cook"
Maybe if there was an easy way to transfer the sim number to esim it would be ok but i find crazy cheap sims internationally
Wait if I can have two esims why do I need a sim tray Thats just annoying either way
"Its ok to live without iPhones bro No carrier in will go out of business outside of US

Edit not to mention iphones outside of US still have physical sim trays This only specifically screws Americans"
its not a feature its a service u gotta pay after 2 yrs
Yeah thats the only thing that intrigued me Sounds like a lifesaving thing in certain conditions
The 13 already had all that and kept the SIM tray Eventually the space will be used for something better in future models but shortterm it is a downgrade
I expect SOME upgrades You cant sell the exact same thing an year later with LESS features at the exact same price
Sounds to me like they spent most of the presentation talking about existing features for those devices and then barely touched on the new features which are super underwhelming
Watches were alright AirPods are meh iPhone 14 lineup is extremely disappointing
So much of this presentation was stating what everyone already knew about the devices OR features that arent noteworthy
Im not racist but I totally agree that the iPhone 14 Pro was hype The only thing that was eventworthy IMO
its not sexist to say its a shitty upgrade the feature is objectively useless for half the user base
Im not sexist as i get hot flashes too
"The performance isnt really the reason this is disappointing its that the base model iPhone has now set a precident of getting the last gen tech rather than being effectively in lockstep across the lineup

It wont matter much but more segmentation in the lineup is a bit unfortunate to see"
A15 was only 1015 faster than the A14 So with the iPhone 14 youre basically getting minimal performance improvement from two years ago In the past upgrading every two years would get you a noticeable performance improvement
My main reason is that if Apple does something all others follow them meaning that it could only be a matter of time till we see a Samsung Galaxy S phone with an older Snapdragon
It always does when you want to play games
But the phone costs more with last years tech If it was 599 starting I could see it but not at 700
You should keep it until iPhone 17
Keeping my XS until they stop supporting it These new phones are a joke 
Keeping my XS lmao battery life is a bit of a problem now but it still does everything else I need
Im keeping my iPhone 12 until usb c comes to iPhone
i have the 11 pro max and was looking to upgrade 2 key things I was expecting new processor and more ram phone has neitherlooks like Im dealing with this phone for at least another year
I am keeping my 6 
Pixel 7 event next month Oct 6httpstwittercommadebygooglestatus1567182794681454603
Not sure what that has to do with their comment Knowing whats coming doesnt make it any more impressive
Well as long as its a thing why would they stop complaining if they dont like it
And Ive been seeing people like you complaining about the complainers for just as long I guess you should be easily able to empathize
They now beat the dead horses dead clone
Going to a PITA if you have a main plan that doesnt support eSIM
I dont know about his case but there are tons of countries that do not have eSim I travel to DR frequently and I am pretty sure they dont have eSim yet
Travelling  It will be a nightmare to have to go into a phone store in a country that isnt English friendly and try and get them to port in a secondary esim for you
Ill have to adapt then
Legit question why do people need two sims
Consider a galaxy as well if you are willing to consider a pixel Its more likely to be discounted and the Samsung has a higher quality standard  than Google does and I say that as someone that absolutely loves google products
10 a day it is
What are you suppose to do when you travel I buy a SIM card for the country Im in so I can text and stuff in foreign countries
theres a massive price hike all over the EU tho
Im fairly handy so I may get and ifix it kit and replace the battery
Replace it for 59 dollars at an apple store its that easy 
You can still buy the 13 mini from Apple
Its rare enough that people think I have an extremely old model when they see my 12 mini A lot of people dont even realize it exists
Was shopping for a new iPhone recently and wanted to get a mini Went for the normal sized one when I found out it was 50 euros cheaper than the mini lol
Not enough people bought it because Apple fucked up the marketing Delayed the mini for an extra month at launch and everyone forgot about it Literally every person I show my mini to says something along the lines of Oh man thats a nice size I didnt even know that was a thing
Tried it and it sucked felt like using a phone from 10 years ago constantly worrying about my battery life
Yes
It was the price if it was significantly cheaper maybe 100 more than the SE it would have been a hit I think that body comes back as an SE 
One thing is having an option another not being able to use a physica SIM anymore At all
"Interesting Im on ATT itself and they wont let me do a esim with my account 

Debating clowning off to Visible as is given coverage problems 

God bless Apple if they can really force carries to get over themselves and let customers swap around as they please Would be nice to jump every 6 months to another carrier and drag my phone along with me at the press of a button"
yes
I use it for my main plan son tray was for travel and areas where Verizon doesnt have service
Have only heard bad things about eSim in the UK but maybe its better in the US
Im sorry but when you guys defend stuff like this I wonder if yall have stocks in Apple or something
""
underrated comment
ipad air is usb c too
The iPad Pro was already USBC years ago
It does have usb c 
"Sure but theres gotta be a design for taking apart earbuds that doesnt destroy them

Since right now not even Apple can nondestructively get them apart since the cost to replace a battery through them is the same as the cost of an entire new earbud

I just cant spend that much on something whos battery will be dead AF in two years with no fix"
"	Being environmental isnt an all or nothing proposition  Are they perfect No  Do they do some things that reduce environmental impact  Yes  Are they better than most big corporations  As far as I know yes

Then do research on the topic Apple isnt as green as they like you to think they are Classic greenwashing They also have a massive responsibility considering their market share And no they are not nearly doing enough 

	Until you are perfect in your own life stop holding others to an impossible standard

Oh but I do a ton 

	Also batteries can be recycled even when a product is not userrepairable  Youre conflating two issues

They are glued into your AirPods so no Once the battery dies they are done Period"
"Until you are perfect in your own life stop holding others to an impossible standard

This is such a bullshit argument Apple is responsible for a shit ton of ewaste and anything they can do to improve that is their moral imperative"
"iPhone 13 128GB base model was 799 at launch

iPhone 14 128GB base model is 799 at launch

At least US prices are the same"
"alwayson and the pill thing is enough for me to upgrade 

Ill pay off the remainder of my 13PMs instalments sell it then I can start a new instalment plan with the 14PM and even have a bit of  left over from selling the 13PM winwin"
Yeah however the additional satellite connection is a kinda cool new feature
Said the exact same thing when they dropped the iPhone 4 size  Baseline sizes just keep getting bigger and bigger  My pocket and hands are still the same sizes 
They still sold millions of them This is silly
Theyre the other extreme Theres nothing in the same sort of screen size as the iPhone SE although the bezels on that make it effectively a much bigger screen than it should be
portless sounds like hell
Really I wonder why lol
But then especially for Europe you could just get a 10GB SIM for 5 and have a go for the while
and how much are you paying for your contract
In India we are getting 13 at 880  14 at 1005  and 13 pro at 1368  so will mostly buy 13 as it will be the cheapest even after some more discount
Yep will mostly buy this as it is the cheapest 880  between 13 13 pro and 14
2nded Love it
The Huawei Mate 50 pro has satellite emergency services oh and 2 sim card slots too
The 13 Pro Max is what youre looking for I think Well except for USB C But that and SIM seem mutually exclusive now
"I mean I went from a 6s to the XR and then 13Pro I only went to the 13 pro because I wanted a better camera and screen 

Now I wont until its usbc"
it sucks too bc I was really excited for the AirPods Pros
Copium
Apple knows they need to re invent something hence the sick Pro models of this year Its the first time since iPhone X have I fell in love with iPhones again
Gotta hit up that Loch Ness monsta
For the larger one
And Apple wont sell you the 13 pro anymore so you either get the 13 the 14 or the 14 pro series
Like I have a lot of issues with the keyboard locking and not working call volume checked with my carrier they say its the phone but ya know freezes a lot etc
The large model of the 14 is a plus yet the Pro is a max
What has yours been doing My main issue is storage on 256gb
Pardon my ignorance The only time I use the lightning port is for charging I use iCloud to access media wirelessly Would I benefit from usb c
It should be an included feature regardless if no one cares about it Especially on a 900 phone Keep up with the competition
I changed my mind and Im getting the 13 Pro Max now lmao
"Someone mentioned pro motion earlier

What is pro motion exactly"
"Exactly why I am holding myself back

If I wait another year the 15 may be a big enough improvement that Warrants the upgrade"
"13 pro was the first time I bought a new phone at launch 

I am gonna hold off until the 15 at least before I upgrade"
"Mostly FOMO
But also I think the battery on my iPhone 13 pro is not as good as it should be 

Ive only had it a year and the max capacity is 94"
People that buy iphone always upgrading their 25years old phone with that its alrdy consider upgrade Who the hell upgrade from 13 base to 14 base 
"Because it feels like every year they say the same thing and some way

x200B

I might just be hating on apple thought"
"I guess it depends on how much the 13 drops in price

But yeah 13 Pro might be the same price as the 14 normal lol"
What are some good examples
Gotcha
"I dont think so Wireless charging is slower and less energy efficient and wireless data exchange is significantly slower then a wired connection Given that they make a pretty big deal about thge amazing cameras the Iphone has and its storage capacity a wireless download of all your pictures and videos to your mac could take a day

Honestly I expect Apple to just keep the lightning port and try to drag possible trials so long the EU will just give up"
Thanks If you come across a reputable brand that has one for the Pro Max please let me know
Oh I know why the mini was cancelled Those of us who love small phones are ultimately a small yet passionate niche that compounded with the fact that the 12 mini was released when the also small but much cheaper 2020 SE was around certainly hurt sales even more Though it still doesnt stop me from being sad to see it go

True but there was talk that Apple could switch to USBC next year as the EU is trying to make it mandatory plus USBC can deliver faster speeds then lightening
The music sounds like they are repeating the n word over and over
"Not even The iPhone 13 pro has already a better camera and display 
They could withhold the newer photo processing"
I no longer allow Reddit to profit from my content  Mass exodus 2023  mass edited with httpsredactdev
The 13 pro is no more
UK update the iPhone 14 Plus is the same price as the 13 Pro
Is that discounted from what it was selling at previously Im probably going to trade in my 12 Mini for the battery life upgrade
Wow thats actually a pretty fantastic value especially in our inflationary environment For all intents and purposes the phones are basically the same
How do people afford these I busted my ass out to get an iPhone 6
It was the best iPhone yet
"Not the first time either

Rip Jack Headphone"
My 6s is dying and nearly seven years old but Im babying it to keep my headphone jack I have two really nice pairs of headphones one with a really good microphone I use so Im dreading upgrading A friend uses that little dongle but thats annoying and shes had to replace her Lightning jack twice
yeah within one year eSIM will be the norm thanks to Apple Not a single telco will want to miss out on iPhone users Easy to activate online voila done No more messing with finding a local walmart type of store to buy a sim card from a bored student who doesnt have a clue and takes 15 minutes to activate the damn thing

Grow bigger hands Steve Jobs
Do you know if theyll be knocking the price down on the 13 Mini would like to trade in my 12 Mini as well
I bet the mini series will become the SE soon
"My 12 Mini is at 85 battery health now Seriously thinking of just getting a 13 mini if Apple does not announce a replacement when Im due for an upgrade

x200B

NGL I was planning to skip this generation anyway but the iPhone 14 series confirmed that the annual Mini is dead I want to hold on to hope that it becomes the next SE or that a Mini will be released every other year but it seems unlikely"
Thats my expectation The 13 mini will become the new SE
"I felt like the old man yelling at clouds when Apple announced their transition away from the original iPhone into phablets They spent a decade explaining the philosophy behind the design of the iPhone and their focus on the onehanded user experience 

Love or hate Jobs he built an empire on the idea of selling users solutions to problems they didnt know they had rather than blindly building products that people are asking for The original iPhone is a product of the former while the iPhone of today is the result of design by committee"

When it comes to Android small phones are the size of the normalsized iPhone Theyve been calling the Zenfone 9 a small phone
"there are many phones to be found around 661 screensize Those tend to be as wide as the Z5c and just 2cm longer For me that is acceptable still fits in my pants very easily

My Z3c was probably among the best phones I ever had but the Z5c was actually kinda a piece of garbage Ran hot camera was blurry near the sides common problem Sony refused to acknowledge and it had some weird software bugs like the audio dropping in calls

And unironically the best Android Ive ever had is my current Huawei P30 awesome phone But I have to pick a new phone from work and I refuse the Samsung Craplaxy Might go for iPhone this year"
Samsung s10e was pretty solid
Pixel 3 was great
Why would they do that It sold like garbage Great phone but theres clearly not much demand Successful companies dont make products people dont want to buy
Yup Already looking forward to the price drop and going to grab a completely maxed out one Its going to have to last me a long time
What Im wondering is are the iPhone mini crowd even likely to be the ones upgrading every year Like if they come out with a mini every 34 years wouldnt that satisfy most mini users
I cant agree with this comment enough
My only continued gripe is battery life Which I fully understood would be a trade off when I got my 12 mini Now I guess Ill get the 13 mini after Apple inevitably drops the price
100 me too Best iPhone ive ever had I just had kids and being able to use the phone one handed while holding a baby is utterly clutch
Really wanted to love the mini but a normal work day with it the battery was atrocious
I dont know how they managed to stick such a better camera into the 12 Mini compared to my 11
I dont know what mini you have but the 13 mini was a significant improvement in battery life over the 12 mini My 13 mini has plenty of juice and I spend way too much time on my phone
Upgrade to the 13 mini Its much better in terms of battery and screen
Agreed if youre intending to keep it in the future extract the resale value of the 12 mini and settle on the 13 mini with the much better battery a brighter screen smaller notch A15 and better camera Small improvements on a regular year but given the mini is gone the 13 mini would be the one to hold onto
You side load the emulator from a PC or are you jailbroken
Too bad you cant use it for much more than Genshin Impact
A VERY good decision for me was to buy the 1TB 13 Pro off a guy that didnt like the size in March for a hugeee bargain  5500 z It was selling for 8500 in stores and having to wait for weeks to get it
well why should people pay the same price in every region Its Apples decision on whether they want to charge the same prices in different markets when converted into US dollars
Pretty much except you lose a lot of the Pro features for a minor increase in sustained performance
any difference on the durability between them I dont really mind the camera stuff too much tbh
Was a joke I believe OP meant SIM trays
you can already send the data of your phone to another virtual sim so theres no reason to keep the sim card tray
Google introduced native support for multiple eSIMs in Android 13httpsblogesperioandroiddessertbites19esimmepandroid139683475 so youre probably right Dual SIM is huge in some markets where Samsung dominates which means theyre probably safe to introduce it in a couple of years with carrier sign on
"Yes

However you can attach certain conditions to them in software much like regular sims but you cant take them out to get rid of the conditions 

So hypothetically if you didnt pay your bill due to an argument with the operator they could stop you from adding another plan on to the eSim Then youre stuck as you cant take the eSim out and put another one in 

Also look at pricing When Apple Watch with eSim first came out in the UK only 1 operator supported it and they set a stupid price 7 a month for 10GB data You also couldnt roam Not a big deal in a watch but imagine this in a phone This is what will happen to the iPhone 14 as youre taking away competition from operators that cant sometimes because of the network they piggyback onto use eSim 

The fact an operator could attach conditions to your devices connectivity and you do not have an option to remove it should be pretty worrying to consumers"
"You know not that I need to answer some rando Apple fanboy defenderapologist who claims source but

"They typically dont change the design year over year anymore and theyve essentially had the same chip in the Apple Watch for like 3 or 4 years now

Even the A16 is barely faster than the A15 its not like its 2x fast like back in the A7A10 days

Weve plateaued as far as smart phone tech is concerned"
chips different suspected this is exactly how it was gonna go down with the regular 14s having the 5core GPU version instead of the 4 core GPU version that the regular 13 and 13 mini
theyre saving for later 
A15 has one more core than last years A15
The service is worldwide the subscription is USCan only as far as we know
" In the US the 14 starts at USD 799 Even with VAT which is 10 max it is a lot cheaper there

Amazing let me just buy it in USA where its cheaper and put a SIM card in when I return home"
How much is the SE  Thats the entry level
Well its 1100 eur here and the 13 is just under 900 eur
Bare minimum features and they think youll love it
microSD lol Pixel OnePlus and now even Samsung flagships are done with it It is pretty old school tech given how much fast standard storage these devices have and that microSDs are much slower to write to
microsd and usbc wasnt added to the pro model tho

Which makes this the iPhone 12SS
because it was
"Yeah at least the S upgrades included pretty big bumps in performance 

IMO it used to be that the S upgrades were a bigger deal than the nonS upgrades iPhone 4 to 4S was a bigger step up than iPhone 3GS to iPhone 4 or iPhone 4S to iPhone 5 iPhone 5 to iPhone 5S was a bigger upgrade than iPhone 5S to iPhone 6 Same goes for iPhone 6 to 6S compared to iPhone 6S to iPhone 7"
Feels more like a iPhone 13c
Best battery live ever
What you gain in camera you lose out in screen material LiDAR additional lens etc Its a worse phone than the 13 ProMax overall for what will be a similar price
Exactly 10  15 even 20 improvements to many things they tout are barely noticeable
The 14 pro looks to be a substantial upgrade to the 11 pro particularly in terms of camera
All they hope is that we buy them
Did the USB people get their hands on iPhone naming now
They should bring back the headphone jack
"SIM card isnt dead though

For that matter neither is the 35mm jack"
Alex i take stupid stuff Americans say without having any clue for 500
Yeah we use the landline for calls around here My rich friend even has a radio phone its pretty dope
Yeah if both your carriers already offer eSIM you dont need the physical one anymore if you own a 13 or 13pro
Ive always liked being able to just swap SIM cards when I buy a new phone This eSim thing Im sure its fine but that seems like itll be more annoying than just replacing a piece of hardware one time
Because esim is unheard of and not used in the vast majority of the world It affects people who set foot outside of US
"After SIM is gone there is only one port left The cable connector at the bottom 

One has to assume they have hardlocked plans to remove that last port within 12 years otherwise they would have made the jump to USBC by now At this point Lighting is probably a burden for Apple Its old slow and just a straight out L for them in every comparison to other devices"
Really
I mean with current alternatives SPOT Garmin inReach you also need to pay and you dont get 2 years free I think but you also need to buy or rent charge and carry with you a separate device
Well tbh if I ever need it Im not gonna complain about paying for it
"Yesterday the iPhone 13 was selling at the exact same price as it was a year ago but you were ok with that

Seems like a strange distinction"
What features did we lose with the 14
At least the iPhone 14 PRO features are interesting so far
Other than the Ultra is there really a reason youd upgrade from a series 6 I feel like everything they said these new watches do 7 and 8 the 6 already did
Starts at 799
Or trying to sell problems as features
Im a satanist and I agree
They have been stealthy doing this to Apple watchthey change the SoC number but CPU says the same for 2 gens and a few times with the iPad notably the ipad pro 11 1st and 2nd gen
"I mean its not really a new precedent The 11 got dual cameras two years after the X 3 after the 7 Plus The iPhone 12 got OLED displays 2 years after the XS The 13 got the 13 Pros cameras one year late 

Meanwhile the base iPad has almost always gotten lower power chips one generation late"
Im hoping they have smth big planned for 15 Im still on X
Lol nah Im good When they add USB C and remove the Notch Ill buy
Man we need a phone name reset or our kids are gonna be comparing the iPhone 42 to the Galaxy S65
I broke the screen on mine this weekend and am out of coverage obviously Might end up just getting the 13 pro in green as a replacement
I looked at Apple website it does have usb c 
And it also assumes we all pay attention to iPhone leaks
Im not saying its supposed to be more impressive Im just saying people shouldnt have unrealeastic expectations
Cars still not flying Annoying
At the very least this should force carriers to support eSIM
Youd be surprised So many people dont even know ESIM exists
You can google country name esim and find tons of options instantly downloadable Its great actually
You know its inevitable I can see Samsung mocking Apple for this then adopting the same thing in a few years
"Personal sim and work phone sim 

Or if traveling you can add a second sim for better data coverage if your primary plan is spotty at your destination

Just a couple situations where it could be useful"
"Apple assumes youre rich enough to just buy an iPhone in that country with a month of that countrys service

Apple Dont be poor"
I didnt know about that sorry
I had mine replaced and it didnt seem to help 
I tried that too still so unimpressive compared to my 13
But the 12 mini is gone without a warning
"Odd decision to make if you wanted a mini I mean the difference is so big between the models and the iphones are so expensive that 50 bucks should be what changes your mind

At least thats how I think about it but you obviously disagree "
Most people dont upgrade their phones at launch and the majority of consumers who do tend to be more knowledgeable of the market
People naturally fear change Personally Ive used ESIMs for years and have found them massively more convenient I dont have to go to a store or wait for anything to ship Its great
Odd that ATT doesnt let you Grandfathered account Ive set up an ATT eSIM on a friends Apple Watch so I know its possible
The only bad thing I can say about it is the switch I needed to free up the physical Sim port for a work Sim and had TMobile switch it to eSim They just disabled my phone line and never sent me the eSim which is more on TMobile rather than the technology itself
"quips like this dont make it less true though the most processorintensive things your average iPhone user does are scrolling instagramtiktokwhatever watching youtube videos and playing candy crush if the performance of the A15 in peoples phones was limited to the performance of the A11 or A12 overnight they would not even notice

again you can go lMaO yOu aPpLe sHeEp and all that but it doesnt change the fact that the overwhelming majority of iPhone users dont even remotely use the full potential of their processors by a long shot so upgrading them each year is arguably useless and is done mainly for show and to provide an artificially manufactured reason to upgrade

they should instead do something about the terrible RAM management for example now theres an actual usability issue even on the 13PM apps constantly reloading and the feed I was scrolling reseting the comment I started writing disappearing etc etc thats the real bottleneck not the processor speed which is arguably plenty for the next 34 years at least"
Its a running gag Also Im using my phone Cant go on Reddit at work

Only US its a lot more expensive in other countries
Im not a financial expert  but you havent payed of your Iphone 13 and now you want to buy the 14 sell the 13 and make profit What makes you think that will work If you cant afford a new phone dont buy it youll just do the same thing again next year Installments on less expensive things close to the 1K are a bad financial habit especially when you repeat them every year
Yes but not enough to justify the expense of the tooling and other manufacturing costs I guess
Just like eSIM but here we are

I agree with you aside from weight My gut says wait a year

Fast fashion isnt good"
Yeah since I bought a washing machine and dryer I do Saves money
Have you tried resetting Thats not normal at all
"USB C is the new standard the EU is making a law about that so you dont need different cables for each device

USB C can charge way faster but I dont think it would be much faster on mobile Phones due to technical design

And wireless data transfer is slower compared to a cable connection but if that doesnt bother you or you dont have that much data it doesnt really matter

If you want a new phone soon dont bother waiting I personally only own 1 Iphone so I want to get rid of that single cable that isnt usb c"
For what purpose Why would they spend the money to do that if the demand isnt there Thats not good business
120hz display
120hz
The 13 pro and presumably the 14 pro has a up to 120hz display The 13 and 14 do not
or just buy a new phone when you actually need it
"
Mostly FOMO

Welp

Ive only had it a year and the max capacity is 94

Hmm are you by any chance a heavy user Is it coldhot where you are"
How does that have anything to do with what I said 
usbc folding screens ois modern bluetoothwifi versions under screen cameras larger camera sensors periscope cameras higher capacity batteries
Wait it was not the n word What was it then
I thought it was MAGA for the first few seconds
Would you rather they introduce a new device and say We made this but its not that much better honestly You might as well keep buying the old one
Youll be able to get them on the apple refurbished store in due course
Doesnt mean youre not going to be able to get remaining stock and used ones
"Pity since the 13 Pro would be a much better device for that price 

But gotta gate that telephoto and 120Hz"
"I wonder what they do with all those unopened 13 ProMax units then 

Possibly parts for warranty swaps carrier promos"
Yes its 100 cheaper From 699 down to 599
The only Pro you can buy is the 14 pro now
Yeah They didnt sell the 12Pro after the 13 came out either
And we think youre gonna hate it
Airalo is good but its significantly more expensive than a local sim if you need a lot of data Or if you need a local number Niche use cases admittedly Honestly though it cant be too long now before lost places a true local sim will also just be esim I can already get most us carriers as esim rather than physical Im sure thats true in a lot of places as well
Not for all counties and some counties offer data plans only I guess will buy international version for dual sim or just carry another phone So tired of apple that one day will just switch to android and call it a day
3D Touch
At least when you are forced to upgrade Bluetooth headphones have gotten really good now
you dont need a physical sim card for when you travel
Surprising since even my local German provider doesnt even have eSIM set up yet
Same thing I have a Sony A7iii for taking pro photos I wish they add some other noncamera features to the phone
"That line was crossed at least 5 years back The features and quality of the camera in the newer phones is way beyond what can be appreciated in a casual social media share 

Theyre using this to justify the price Makes no sense"
"Nope both the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro had the A15 Bionic The 13 Pro just had an extra GPU core but they both were called A15 Bionic

Heres Apples websitehttpsimgurcomaZbzZtV8

Bionic stands for the neural engine which they both have"
Im baffled that the iPhone 14 is pretty much a bigger iPhone 13 mini Never seen a base model generation change have so few features added I have a 13 mini and cant possibly see why I would want to upgrade
Starting at 599
Why would they use it for the next SE if it already underperformed in sales Seems much more likely theyll use the XR body or something
"Yeah theyre not small theyre medium sized

Hell the XR and Note 9 my two current phones are both basically identical in size the notes 1cm taller but thats the only difference So Id argue even iPhone medium phones are bordering on large Sure the 13 is a tiny bit smaller than the XR but barely

Meanwhile the mini is basically identical dimension wise to the Z5 compact Which imo is still the perfect size for a small phone anything larger than that area aint small lol"
"Yeah sadly no good real compact phones

The reg s22 xiaomi 12x and if its about size in the pocket flip are all on the smaller side compared to most of current phone market Nothing with the size of the 1213 mini tho"
too bad that phone doesnt work on Verizon 
"Nearly an entire inch taller nearly an inch larger screen so not small

I had the Pixel and the Pixel 2 and they were amazing but theyre not a small series of phones"
Id love USB C but at the same time I havent plugged my phone in in like a year Wireless charging has sort of taken over for me
If it had a telephoto lens itd be perfect
I assume thatd be ok if they made it part of the cycle
"12 series had bad battery life across the board

13 Mini fixed the battery life

13 Mini is the one to have longterm especially since its CPU is good enough to make it to the iPhone 14"
"My 12 mini wasnt too great when I got it and now its downright dismal Toying with just getting a bigger phone for the battery life after this experience 

I could swap the battery and string it along for another year but a size up seems inevitable at some point"
And dont forget the screen which is impossible to see anything on outside
Yeah the battery isnt the longest I personally get through a day and a half with my usage but Im finding I must be a grandpa compared to a lot of users who dont make it through the day
Mine really is fine but sometimes I need to charge it in the middle of the day if Im taking a bunch of photos or watching too many dank memes   Its never really been a hinderance  I have very large hands and it just sits in there nicely
In what way is the screen much better
side load with AltStore
It annoys me that my iPhone 6 had better games than my iPhone 12 Pro Infinity blade the Xmen arcade game metal gear solid mobile now the whole App Store is full of garbageware pay to win games
Apex Legends mobile is cool but yeah its a shame that there arent more deep mobile games considering you can literally slap a controller onto it and its basically an extremely good handheld console hardwarewise
Plus on average 100 in addition to tax Also no one else is doing that so far So ya can people stop defending the greed of the literally richest company on the planet
What do you mean minor increase in sustained perf Did they go with vapor chamber or something
Better just get a used 13 ProMax than getting the 14 and 14 Plus
Dont believe so ancedotally people around here have talked about the regular ones holding up better due to the brushed casings
Interesting Thanks
" Weve plateaued as far as smart phone tech is concerned

Id say so given there is only so much one can do on a smart phone At the same time instead of upgrading every year or second year now I am upgrading every threefour years"
Its the same as it was in iPhone 13 Pro
Cause fuck the rest of the world
Unfortunately for you iPhone 14 sold in the us will no longer have a sim tray 
Yeah obviously I meant entry level for the newest gen SE was technically outdated by the time of its release
just get the 13 or 13 pro u dont even get 120hz for this extra money a feature budget 200 phones enjoy
"Its old school tech because they want you to think it is the fact is that its just cheaper and easier to IP certify a phone without trays a reason as to why they have work so much in eliminating ports and now sim cards 

Also these slow storage are way faster than the practically necessary cloud storage The speed of this SD is fast enough to do anything youd do on your phone anyway including installing and playing games from it Dont get brainwashed  35 jack SD card slots arent irrelevant they are just an inconvenience for the manufacturers"
I just think its cool
Has to come eventually Dont see it anytime soon though Maybe 510 years
But 36months will not work for new iPhone release People will just get new iPhone every 3 years now Apple will not be happy
Vroom vroom
"Id imagine most customers would notice visualfeature changes more than performance bumps though 

4 Retina display stainless steel design glass back

4S Siri dual core CPU

5 T a l l lightning 

5S Touch ID 64bit CPU

The 6S I think was where an average consumer would notice a lot of changes despite being an S iteration 6 only had a larger size 6S had 3D Touch Touch ID 2 and was when the performance truly pulled away from Android devices"
The number changed the outside the S changed the inside
Or 13s
120 hz refresh is also missing a big one that ppl dont notice
Ah thats fair I record all my YT videos on my phone so the video improvements make it better than the 13 despite not having ProMotion LIDAR etc itll be a tough choice next week lol
After going through more details youre right It seems like the 13 Pro still has more camera features even if some of these newer ones seem kind of gimmicky
I see you can connect the dots keep going and you will get there

Outside the US Android has like a 75 market share
Got the pro max everything else is too small for my likes
Im in Europe and all carriers have esims in my country
I mean they can pretty easily change to usbc and will likely do so next year They just have no need to do it yet Theyre not going to go entirely wireless as the technology is not there for it to be viable yet
thats what they said they offer it for free for 2 yrs
Not enough worth upgrading Ill see next year
"I feel the same about my S5 Battery life isnt as good as it was and I want to buy a newer generation as a replacement S6 5Ghz Wifi and a oxygen sensor which I dont think is accurate or useful S7 new design which I personally dont really like S8 data roaming and temperature sensor 

So the upgrade from S5 to S8 would give me 5Ghz WiFi biggest selling point my Apple Watch is the only reason our 24Ghz WiFi is still operating a temperature sensor that was mostly marketed towards woman data roaming pathetic to not give older watches this ability and hopefully better battery life Not sure if this is enough for me maybe it helps you to decide"
Ive never owned an Apple Watch and dont really plan on it Maybe Ill grab a series 3 used or SE used I dont really care about all those extra features
Temperature sensor is new
Most of the time its because of RAM Im guessing they bumping it to 6GB so it should be fine
People say this every year Just bite the bullet and get the 13
"USB C I could see eventually happening

While Im with you on the notch I dunno if thats happening anytime soon I feel like its getting worse with the floating notch thing the iPhone 14 Plus has"
Those features are so minor in the whole experience of the iPhone
"They will probably NEVER Switch to USB C Just because the EU said that every phone has to have the same connector USB C at some point doesnt mean Apple will implement it Apple would rather remove the charging port entirely than adopt an open standard which isnt proprietary 

They brought back magsafe with charging capabilities so that the apple consumer can slowly live with the idea of not having to plug in the phone They will beef up qi charging on iPhones make it like 18  25W and sell you the stupid magsafe charger thus completely getting around adopting USB C on iPhones 

They will then sell you a MagSafe Go powerbank or some shit like that with like 10000 mah so you can charge on the go which will be the MoSt CoNvEnIeNt iPhOnE aCcEsSoRrY yEt They will charge you 59 for it and people will buy it 

They could also adopt USB C fuck who knows"
usb c to lightning not usb c to usb c
Or that theyre even remotely accurate  Which 90 of them are noise and I just dont have time to sort through them all nor care
this is apple forcing US carriers to switch and telling worldwide carriers youre next
Yes unless you want to go somewhere more off the grid and then you end up funneled into some third party reseller who rips you off  Losing the sim is not a win lol
In a few years I expect the mocking adverts soon and eSIM only for the S23 lineup
You can have two ESIMs
Yeah that one had battery life issues the 13 mini was where it all came together
"Well the idea was Im going for a mini because Im upgrading from a SE so the jump isnt as big and its probably cheaper My initial logic was just proven wrong its not like I absolutely didnt want a normal

Was just giving some anecdotal evidence as to why some ppl might have gone for normal over mini"
buddy do you understand the meaning of options 
That might be why this number and account have been with them for an extremely long time
I understand that most people just use their phone for social media Still Id expect to get the latest hardware if Im paying for a phone at that price This literally doesnt benefit the users in anyway Also does this mean they will get less year in software support 
	Yes  Are they better than most big corporations  As far as I know yes
"Well theres information about Apple readily available on the internet httpswwweuronewscomgreen20211001appleaccusedoftryingtoderailclimatelegislationinnewreport

Also I have a very different responsibility than a mega corp like Apple

Also could you stick to one commentthread thats just getting out of hand"
" you havent payed of your Iphone 13 and now you want to buy the 14 sell the 13 and make profit 

thats what Ill do 

 What makes you think that will work 

the remainder of my 13PM instalments is 180k local currency Ill pay that as a lump sum then sell the phone for 350k so Ill have 170k left over then Ill start a new 2yr instalment plan for the 14PM at 25k a month and rinserepeat next year

I could pay the whole thing right away but due to record breaking inflation in the EU paying in instalments at 0 APR is the better financial decision in this particular case as my fixed instalments are going to inflate away more and more as time goes on"
Wouldnt it be the same body as the 13 Like the SE is an 8 The machinery is already there to make it
"Yeah weights definitely a thing to worry about My 13 Pro is quite heavy already

Not holding my breath for ProMotion in standard models though thats a big differentiator"
Yeah I actually have multiple times Itll work for a bit then goes back to it
Thanks for the information friend
For the price theyre charging for the phone they can definitely afford to include a high refresh rate I hate to compare IPhones to androids but if 300 Samsung phones can afford to include a high refresh rate screen the 900 iPhone 14 Plus can This was just an excuse to make the pro models look like the better buy which they kind of are at 100 more Its genius
"Oh Gotcha

And the new ones dont have that"
How do the new phones not have that
Also fair
"I live in Georgia and it is hot as of late

And I charge over night and use my phone every day I am an addict"
Bigger
I think it was saying biggest Just with god awful enunciation
You think Apple would really do that Like what
Doubt it They didnt do that with the X or XS or 11 pro
I think you can only get the 12 pro at refurb store  and judging from the price of those it will be very close to 1k USD anyway
"All the pros gets replaced every year

Only the base models regular mini plus stays with lower price"
"They dont have many Apple is really good about making only what they need They may sell some of them off to resellers a couple weeks before the release if they have more than they need and they keep some for apple care replacements if they are low on refurbs

You can see if Costco or Best Buy have any 13 Pro sales but if they do theyll be short lived"
perfect thanks
Which version has dual sim
Touch ID
My AirPods quit when I lean back in my office chair from my Mac mini They still arent great Also even if I lean forward they often get out of sync so dialog is hard to understand
Not all countries have esim providers
13 mini is comfortable for sure man Im sticking with it even though the battery life sucks a bit
Thats what I was thinking
Usable with one hand and I have small hands
Only thing I use it for is CarPlay
Does magsafe or whatever that puck is work on the 13 mini
Whats your battery health Just checked battery health and mine reports 87
It uses a faster pwm setting so if youre susceptible to pwm headaches or migraines the screen is usable The one on the 12 isnt It also defaults to somewhat brighter auto dimming IIRC probably because the battery is better
" Also no one else is doing that so far

What do you mean by that because this pricing issue doesnt only occur with Apple You pay more for almost every tech product in Europe compared to the US Apple has no obligation to harmonise its prices across territories just like how a Big Mac costs different amounts in different countries"
Europeans constantly complain about everything and anything American so this is just background noise at this point Nobody cares Your currency got weaker Pay the price it costs or just dont buy it Theres plenty of low end android phones you could pick up right now for almost nothing Stop being cheap Or at least stop complaining about it and decide if you want the phone or not The price isnt gonna change
They just mentioned better thermal so it might be it
cool thank you
Exactly My XS lasted through my 13 Pro and with a battery change it could have kept going My 13 feels fine a year later I cant see much persuading me to upgrade for now
Yeah I had my XR from May 2020 until this year February I was planning on using it till the 14 came out but Sprint had a trade in deal where I could get the 13 for 0 and I just couldnt pass up that deal
Because laws regarding satellites are different per country and they cant just charge a subscription for it My bet is within a year it will be available to 50 countries
I know I was being sarcastic 
"	35 jack SD card slots arent irrelevant they are just an inconvenience for the manufacturers

hmm i dunno i havent missed those at all to be honest dealing with failed and bootleg SD cards failed wires in headphones excessive cable noise from wired headphones etc is just not worth it"
No its old school because its slow and obsolete Every time apple makes waves by removing things new better tech becomes mainstream True wireless headphones didnt exist because everyone had a headphone jack and now they are basically the standard Every phone manufacturer and their dog makes wireless buds now Does apple make money off of removing features then solving the problem with another product Absolutely its basically their business model by now but youd be obtuse not to see the leaps in technology that result from it
its objectively not cool its hot generates heaps of waste heat which fucks up your battery and results in an overall slower charging speed vs using a cable
Depends how you read it Comparing operating systems Android has the majority of users Comparing phone manufacturers aka people rolling with iPhones instead of with Samsungs or Pixels then yes Apple has the majority
A 25 drop in revenue within a year will cripple any business actually Their cash flow will be fucked and the management will all be sued and fired by the shareholders especially if the reason was to not service iphones
" Theyre not going to go entirely wireless as the technology is not there for it to be viable yet

Thats the thing though It feels like Apple made the bet that it would be didnt plan the migration into the roadmap and now they are stuck with Lighting And every year they keep holding off hoping that wireless finally becomes fast and efficient enough

Why else is it not here yet They have done it on other products like the ipad so its not like they cant There has to be reason they keep not doing it The only reasonable idea is that they keep making the bet that they can go full wireless before usbc is required"
fucking lol no wonder they spent so much presenting it with video montage and all I wouldnt be surprised they charge for the womens health thing too lol
"nah thr good thing about their devices is the longevity i really have no need to bite the bullet rn cause my shit still works im stull able to do everything i need to do everyday on my iphoneX 

have it on usb c then im upgrading instantly"
i mean at least with the 15 well get usb c unless apple decides to make a europe only model of the iphone lol
I want 120 as well but honestly Theyll probably never add it to the standard devices so Ive made peace with it If it happens great if not no biggie for me
USB C will be a requirement by the EU later next year I actually thought they were going to do this with this one but we will see
"Absolutely not Im not buying any device thats not USBC anymore Period

Reasons are plentiful from environmental aspects to personal convenience"
"MagSafe is intentionally limited to 7w charging on Qi with anything higher being apple proprietary

But it still would let them skirt it they officially support an open charging standard but if you want the good stuff gotta by MFA products"
MagSafe batteries already exist
Oooohhh well that sucks
Yeah thats the worst part Im super hopeful they do switch but it aint gonna help me next month in South America
I know was just answering the commenter asking why to have two different SIMseSIMs at once
For me I got the 12 after owning the SE v2 for a few months because the battery life was too low for my use case Id originally have gone with the mini but heard that the battery was small on that one too so I went for the normal 12 and havent regretted it once
If youre looking for options Apple isnt going to be for you
"So how was what I wrote wrong or inaccurate

httpswwwcsrhubcomCSRandsustainabilityinformationAppleInc"
"The link you provided is about Apple lobbying against environmental laws being set and NOT about how Apple isnt being environmentally friendly in its business practices  But its not just Apple fighting the regulations its a lot of corporations  On the one hand corporations may not want environmental regulations because they dont want to clean up their act  On the other hand a corporation can also be or are working to be environmental but still dont want the regulation so that they arent forced to regulate in ways that arent applicable to them  

Example  I am a doctor  I understand that there are certain requirements that are needed to maintain my licensing  However when they added the need for retaking board certification exams every 10 years I was EXTREMELY angry about it and supported all efforts to oppose it  Not because I want there to be a low bar for licensing or board certification  Or because I myself dont do any reading or keeping up with the latest info  But because it was a bullshit requirement to begin with which did not ensure better quality doctors  The exams were designed for a broad range within my speciality  34 of the questions had nothing to do with my practice  Probably 30 of the questions were things I hadnt encountered since residency over a decade ago  Ie They are testing me on things that are irrelevant  It also provided a way for the board to regularly collect a large sum of exam fees   I am not alone in feeling this way  The 10 year requirement was finally dropped recently after widespread dissent and exposure of corruption amongst board management members

This is a longer answer than you deserve  What Im saying is that your view and standards are too myopic  For the final time Im not saying Apple is perfect or doesnt have room for improvement"
I didnt know Apple has a 0 installment plan Interesting
Maybe there are other components that are specific to the mini ie logic board that dont justify the cost of maintaining specific processes for their production
"Yeah maybe im dreaming on the promotion front lol

Oh well at least im in a place where my phones working and not slow"
"Damn thats so weird

With resetting do you mean pressing the volume and the power buttons or actually resetting to factory"
You figured it out
apple just didnt include a screen that refreshes 120 times a second
I upgraded from an iphone 7 to an iphone 13 pro all this time I had the money to buy a new one whenever I wanted but I just wasnt compelled to that was until my 7 broke down im probably not going to upgrade until this phone slows down or there is VERY big upgrade not saying you have to upgrade every 6 gens like me but think about hpw many of the Innovative features mentioned in the iphone 13 pro conference you remember or use and youll see how niche some of them are and you dont need for the most part
If youre a heavy user and running through the battery cycles fast it would make sense for your battery to degrade faster
So would I but theyre not going to do that because itll hinder sales of newer devices
The 12 Pro and Pro Max are available right now to purchase refurbished
The iPhone 12s have been there for the last year Where have you been
Right If they sold last years Pro at this years base model price no one would buy the base model That would be good for us but bad for Apple indicating that thats what people should do if theyre looking to pay base model price
I have 13 pro I use eSIM and physical sim
iphone se 2
What percent is your battery health down to
"Eighty six 

Its fine if I dont like use it But if Im traveling or on the road Im always thinking about the charging strategy for the day"
Ok the PWM setting sounds like a big deal for some people
theyre literally the same amount right now 1dollar is 1 euro wtf are you even talking about
" My XS lasted through my 13 Pro and with a battery change it could have kept going

Im still on my XS Was going to upgrade last year but decided at the last minute not to due to it being rather underwhelming for me The battery is in service stage and I might just replace the battery and use it as my second line"
Wouldnt bet on it There are enough features which are still US only after some years
"dealing with failed and bootleg SD cards failed wires in headphones excessive cable noise from wired headphones etc is just not worth it

Ok this comment is ridiculous Bootleg SD cards Seriously Failed wires in headphones Just not worth it LOL SD cards are dirt cheap interchangeable and can easily be replaced compared to the cost of buying another phone Wired headphones not working or giving cable noise Throw them out and replace them with another pair of wired headphones theyre like 10 at Walmart LOL   


Forget buying new Apple devices Ill just buy more Apple stock because at this point its obvious people can convince themselves of anything"
Its fair that you dont miss em that was where apple put most of their efforts into Convincing people they dont need it a feature Remember we dont need smartphones everything is a created necessity  But there is something to be said about the company manufacturing our necessity instead of the consumer demanding it No one really asked for it we cant miss how we would use SD cards nowadays either
" Every phone manufacturer and their dog makes wireless buds now

And every year there are hundreds of videos on YouTube of people talking about the limitations of so many of those same headphones"
Plurality not majority
LOL
This is just completely baseless speculation and youre just grasping at straws They have no need to change away from lightning Theyre not going to box themselves in by saying theyre going to do something in 5 years and sticking by it if its not viable They could easily change to USBC if they want
i know ur battery life is ass
Cant they push it back to the 16 though since the Europe law says fall of 2024 I believe
usb c is a fucking game changer

Like what
im not sure what the incredulity is for yes cables and sd cards fail and they dont provide any benefits that outweigh any of their issues internal phone storage is much larger than it was back when microSD was standard i havent needed any storage expansion sd cloud or otherwise since moving away from SD simply because my phone already holds enough data as for the earbuds 10 shitty wired walmart earbuds sound like garbage and they have loads of cable noise not to mention the lack of ANC and other niceties all of the new stuff is just better whether or not it comes from apple you can tell because all of the android phones are following suit like they always do
"Nobody convinced me I dont need a 35mm jack With the crazy prevalence of Bluetooth headphones I can say Ive never once used my 35mm adapter

I would like an SD card slot but iCloud integration into things like Photos has made that point nearly moot as well Aside from Podcasts filling up my entire phone without me telling it to one time Ive not run out of space on my phone since the days of the iPhone 4

I think theres an argument to be made about a company deciding whats necessary and what isnt  but this always reminds me of automakers creating electric cars and the very vocal gearheads complaining that their V8 is gone instead of being excited about zero gas costs and being faster in every measurable way I personally havent missed anything thats been removed I was skeptical about not having a home button I love not having a home button now I was skeptical about the idea of switching from android and losing expandable storage Ive never really needed it"
There are millions of people on YouTube that are dumb af too whats your point Wired headphones have a fking leash as their main limitation but if you want that tangly breakageprone passive noise generating rope at the end of your earbuds then have at it I guess With wireless charging cases and decent battery life I dont even notice that I have to charge them I have amazing active noise cancellation and they are objectively faster to get out of my pocket and connected to my phone than any wired buds Ive ever had
Majority can be used in place of plurality more specifically referred to as relative majority but in the end its just linguistics
battery health at 69 babyyyyy lmao but honestly its fine cause i have a wireless power bank
Facts And gets hot as shit also
technically yes but it would be in apples best interest because the ruling dictates that there shouldnt be products on the market that are not compliant and usually Apple sells the previous gen in parallel so theyll wanna be a year ahead

"I use my phone quite a bit most days But yeah Ill usually juice it from like 60 to full in the late morning and then be on fumes by bedtime Probably around a 100 cycle per day when you add it all up 

Still cant avoid charging during the day without cutting it ultra close or losing"
"currency devaluation

What currency devaluation when they are both worth the same exact amount"
Apple Cash
"A headphone jack doesnt prevent you from using Bluetooth headphones way to miss the whole point

	all of the new stuff is just better whether or not it comes from apple you can tell because all of the android phones are following suit like they always do

Better in this case meaning all those manufacturers can produce their own line of expensive wireless earbuds like Apple did when they removed the jack"
"10 shitty wired walmart earbuds sound like garbage and they have loads of cable noise

I own both the 10 shitty wired Walmart earbuds the 30 Apple wired earpods and the 250 AirPods as well We can split hairs all we want but the AirPods also have a ton of issues as well that offset most of the benefits of wired earbuds the only real difference is price Yeah you get ANC with AirPods but you also get reduced battery life along with long term battery degradation   


Question Whats cheaper a microSD card or a new iPad If I want to have an SD card loaded with music or movies for a flight an SD card with work information and a SD card with vacation pictures its easy and straightforward For an iPad I either have to buy an iPad with more storage which equals more  or I have to sacrifice storage for something else   


As for Android following suit theyre not following suit because Apple does it better theyre following because they want to rake in the cash like Apple does Thats it Thats all it is   


Youre welcome to believe whatever you want but you need to know you look ridiculous when you make an argument that buying a 20 SD card is somehow more inconvenient than buying a whole new iPad or that 1030 wired headphones are somehow more of a hassle than 250 wireless headphones"
"Your example of car is just not the same Having a headphone jack sim slot and sd slot are independent from good cloud service good bluetooth and esim capabilities That is all can exist at the same time If so besides more cash whats the point of removing them Space constraint is bs since we have 2 current examples with all of those feature plus all of the modern features too

On the other hand upgrading to a new engine means the old one is no longer in place"
"The crazy prevalence of Bluetooth headphones was inevitable but removing the 35 wasnt  I use an iPhone but I often feel jealous of my coworker who have both Bluetooth EarBuds and also a 35 jack for their expensive headphones He has cloud storage as well as SD cards which he uses in a clever way to bypass some hassles of entertainment in the locked out of fun computers we use The fact that now we think we dont need want em because we dont have the immediate necessity doesnt mean we are better off without it 

Most of the features smartphones have nowadays we dont need its just a convenience that we appreciate Same with the features companies convince us if we want it or not"
Yes it does You think ever usbc cable is the same Because they are not
Typically backup I did it as a new phone once or twice I figured it isnt a big loss because my lease with TMobile is up in a few weeks
And therefore I shouldnt call them out on their inconsistent behaviour
Even if you change it it wont fundamentally fix the issue I think when Im below 80 Im gonna change it Either way you should just for sanity Its like 79 I think
The Euro used to be worth more You didnt know that
and a floppy drive doesnt prevent you from using USB ports so we should really include one in all newly made computers i need to read my floppies and i just cant make do with an adapter
Oh lord you have absolutely no idea what youre talking about sorry mate Go google it and then come back when you at least have a basic knowledge about how things work
"I see That really sucks

 I figured it isnt a big loss because my lease with TMobile is up in a few weeks

Ah at least you got that going for you I wish that type of deal existed in my country"
"The difference between the headphone jack and your stupid analogy is that wireless earbuds werent superior technology to wired earbuds at the time And they still arent in many ways

Just be honest that they removed them to push AirPods because thats what they did Ive come to terms with the fact that new phones wont have headphone jacks anymore but hearing people bullshit about how this was actually a proconsumer thing is gag worthy"
Itsalright I usually dont upgrade my phone very often I usually wait until it starts having issues like now but I can see the benefits I hope they get something along the same lines for where you live
"Yeah I usually wait a few years too Currently using an Xs still deciding on wether I should upgrade now or next year

Thanks"
Cant wait for Spotify to not make use of the dynamic island for at least a year lol
The Dynamic Island
Dynamic island is the most apple name Ive ever heard but god damn is that sleek how it interacts with the software
removed
Love the Purple Shame they didnt bring back BlueGreen though
"2017 eww a notch 

2022 wow a dynamic island "
That Dynamic Island is sick cant wait to play around with the developer APIs for it
That new notch and software around it look sexy
This is a very clever use of the display space
Did Apple just make me WANT a notch
Dynamic Island is pretty fucking cool  whoever came up with this deserves their salary for sure
The notification animations are a return to classic Apple whimsy Is it needed No But its fun and embraces it Love the look
I like what they do with the pill The dynamic island is such a cool integration
The fact that the pill is interactive is so cool
"I like this Theyve sold me on the island lol Ill still stick with my 13 Pro Max but I like what theyve done

2000 nits of brightness is insane

edit that snipe at the competition lol Nice"
"So the leakers really had no idea what was going on with the pillhole punch thing did they up until about a week ago 
 
Lesson learned not even the reliable sources have good inside info necessarily theyre just speculating off of the dummy units floating around"
"The dynamic island is first piece of truly incredible interface design that Apple has made in a long time Bravo

As a design engineer this is truly beautiful

EDIT Some more thoughts on the operational aspect of this and maybe why no ORMs on Android have implemented something similar

This is impressive because its genuinely a lot of effort to implement and maintain since it requires core OS changes that also deviate from other iOS devices Its a large decision for a feature with a lot of sideeffects that will affect tons of iOS developers as well as the core developers of iOS itself for several years

More interestingly its on a feature that is likely to be transient go away in the medium term so its brave lol that theyre investing a bunch of engineering and design effort  and subjecting all other iOS devs to it  on a feature they eventually probably want to phase out Definitely leads me to believe that the cutout is here to stay for a while"
They kept the 999 price
deleted
Always on display is here too
That software and hardware integration of the notch is freaking cool
Finally now I can afford to buy an iPhone 12
At first seeing the 14 models I was certain I was keeping my 12 pro for another year  Now seeing the pros Apple really did make the pros stand out way more this year than years prior outside of the typical camera upgrade Im honestly considering it Dynamic island looks cool too Also does this still have MagSafe
The German price increases are insane 1000  for the basic iPhone 14 and 1300 x for the 14 pro is just a joke
That purple 
The biggest feature here is not the stupid island but rather the 2000 nits brightness Thats amazing
"1300 for the Pro 1450 for the Pro Max 

What the fuck"
Holy shit i love the dynamic island and how they leaned into it so Apple
The front camera will be so dirty
Dynamic island is such a fun little Apple UI treat
They must be giving up on the EU market with those prices
I have to say What they did with the dynamic island is very clever softwarewise That alone makes me want the pro more than the others
"I thought Id take the notch any time this wastes even more screen space But it doesnt They used every single pixel of it for notification margins and so on Smart sons of bitches 

Looking at this design I know Steve Jobs is still smiling somewhere"
How to transform a flaw into a cool featue  hats off apple designer
"Goofy ass name aside From a design perspective the dynamic island is very clever integration between hardware and software Excited to see how well its actually implemented in apps 

And this is the best implementation of always on display ive seen yet So I guess theyre forgiven for being late to the party 

And also we are getting damn close to the practical limits of photolithography these days  Crazy that were already at 4nm transistors on consumer devices

edit I also commend the folks at apple for advocating womens health in the watch Idk any other company that has such a good implementation"
1329 for the pro wow
Vitor looks like hes been awake all night
Ill be upgrading from my 11 pro but wish it had usbC and WiFi 6E
USD 1400 for the cheapest version here in Denmark God damn
Typec would have pulled my trigger
Nice price increase everywhere else but the states Nice on them not mentioning it
My wallet is ready
"Holy fuck the 14 Pro is 1100

150 increase from the 949 13 Pro 170 

US stays the same Jesus Christ"
My hands are sore just looking at all of that top of the screen UI
"It seems like a decent way to get androidlike notification

Im VERY happy to see it Notifications has always been the one thing Android has excelled at

AND ALWAYS ON DISPLAY FINALLY"
Im seriously disappointed The base model price has increased by a fourth to 1000 in Germany The base model Without 120Hz with base 128GB storage and basically no improvements to battery life still the same old processor no further resistances Nothing For 200 more The pro model only costs 13 more but still only has 128GB base storage And overall there are no faster charging methods no better magsafe nothing
Thats actually pretty cool
so much for all the people that said it just looks different
I dont think anyone saw the Dynamic Island animations coming Apple definitely justified changing from the notch to the pill
"Did they really get rid of the sim card slot

Having tMobile with eSim then putting a local sim card for data is really helpful while traveling Is that feature gone"
"Frickin love the Dynamic Island notch interface and holy crap that 48 MP camera

I have an iPhone X and I surely will be upgrading to a 14 Pro Biggest upgrade to the UX since the X"
Who cares the next one has usb c
Im a fan of just the two options lol but why in the name of christ are they still using the lightning port Its been way too long
I like how they make good use of the new notch instead of hiding it like some other companies do
Every time Im ready for a new phone they dont have any good colors And next year I bet there will be a color I want if I grab this shit
This is some real lemonade from lemons shit
150 price increase in the UK  expected but still hurts
The EU prices bro
1569 for the 14 pro max in hungary
The idea behind this is brilliant We have this hardware thing how do we integrate it in to the ui so it becomes cool instead of annoying As someone whos in graphic design I love this
No WiFi 6e to take advantage of my Orbi 6e black edition and still no usbcso Im on the fence of whether to jump on the pro max or another year of holding onto my iPhone X and waiting for the next product announcement
No USBC
What is dynamic island As somebody at work that cant watch at the moment
Its possible to disable always on display
Happy the leakers didnt figure this one out such a dope feature
Wondering what battery life is compared to 13pm which I have Havent been watching so will check specs for 14 pro and 14 pm vs my 13pm
Im sold
Still so expensive
Ive never gotten a phone any color other than black or white but that purple is really tempting me Purple is my favorite color and while its a slightly darker shade than I like its really good looking
I actually feel like Apple has outdone themselves with this new 14 Pro and the new rugged Apple Watch
For Europeans Too Expensive  No Satellite  No USBC
1500 starting price in Europe lol
It starts at 1299 for the NonMax model damn
Flat 2000 NZD for the regular pro What the fuck
Wow this is cool if only there was a mini version  maybe in a few years
The Dynamic Island is the coolest way of creating an inscreen camera and is the reason Apple is so above other smartphone manufacturers
For those of us in the UK apparently 999 now means 1099 Someone should remind Apple which way the conversion rate works Fuck me
That Dynamic Island feature alone would help Apple sell that iPhone like a hotcake
Still no USBC
REALLY loving the way the pill interacts with ios this is the first iPhone update that ive been genuinely excited about since the X
Dynamic Island will looks super awkward with screen protector applied if its not covering whole screen no cutouts
1099 in the UK Wouldnt be surprised if this doesnt do too well here
For the first time ever the iPhone costs more  than the  Apple have really arse fucked us UK people now 999 or 1099 
Oof UK price is 150 more than the 13 Pro for the base model at 1099
Do the pro models support USB 30 speeds on lightning
Very tempting Rocking my iPhone 13 Pro that I got for very cheap but the satellite calling for hiking might be enough to push me
16 price increase is savage
The new notch looks cool but will make iphone even more harder to use onehended ios navigation needs a deep redesign these days android phones have much better design and are more comfortable to use sadly
Tempted to upgrade but I am not totally sold on that dynamic island tbh I dont really like how interacting with it ends up taking up more space than the notch ever took
"Pricing in Europe is INSANE exchange rate EURUSD was 115 last year and 099 now

iPhone 14 Pro Max 512GB is 1869 Im consdering buying it either in Canada or the United States US version has the limitation of being eSIM only but then again is an additional 180 cheaper than Canada"
Can we please get a RED iPhone Pro Ive been holding out with my 11 patiently waiting but alas no red again
I went from iPhone X to iPhone 13 pro and I am seriously considering getting the 14 pro This is a first for me
Dynamic Island really
They purple will look great under my phone case
Damn that island and the screen brightness might finally make me upgrade my iPhone 11  Always on display and the purple are icing on the cake however 1100 is a fat steamy shit on top
As an Android user for around 5 years now I have great respect for Apples design decisions regarding the cutout The Dynamic Island implementation is super creative software design that feels intuitive  cohesive  I think many Android OEMs could learn a thing or two from that approach Hoping Android devices take a little inspiration it is very cool to see software that is creative  exciting like that
Im thinking of the purple one My wife said purple is feminine my response you cant associate gender to a color Plus its deep purple
"48mp photos 

Still same 128gb base storage Come on

Thats not pro


1459 for iphone 14 pro with 256gb 
W t f"
The new notch  I didnt expect them to put all that stuff around it I like it 
Keep your black pill shape in the middle of the screen Im about that always on display
Didnt like the leaks but its so pretty seeing it in action
I think the dynamic island will be the touch bar of iPhones Cooler idea but not really other things like 2000nits of brightness and removing sim cards great
They really made the notch a god damn feature
Terrible colour choices for launch of pro purple is really average Really loved the blue and green from 13 pro but think there should of been one more feminine colour But with this we only have 2 feminine colours and two neutral
Is the island the notch
When can I buy in the UK
Havent been blown away by Apples SW HW integration in a long while That dynamic Island is incredible
As someone who lives outside of North America and needs the SIM tray RIP asking relatives to bring cheaper iPhones from the US 
Pink iPhone Pro when AGGHHH
Not sure if worth the upgrade from an 11 Pro Max    Thinking about it
The dynamic island is a cute feature Very fun use of the pill cutout
Space black color is sexyyyyyy
Starting at 1450 for the Pro Max in Germany is just madness 
Finally I think Its time to upgrade from my iPhone 3GS now
Starts from 1349 expensive
Fucking finally some great design again from apple This is bringing life back into the design of our tech
"I see this being an awesome option for XS 11 11pMax and 12 users or people like me coming back to Apple after a year away

Question though No mention of battery life on pro"
"Very tempting iPhone and I would really love to replace my 12 mini 

But here en Denmark prices are crazy The pro line is starting from 1400 usd 

Maxed out pro and pro max is 2080 usd and 2217 usd Thats waaay more than I would pay for a phone"
I wonder if the iPhone 15 will have the Dynamic Island 
Too expensive 
Yes its cool but the price is getting out of hand wont be upgrading this year
wish they kept the blue 
No USBC no buy If apple wants to bring more Android folk over theyre going to need to start using the technology thats been in phones for the last 6 years
I dont really get it Is it like notification centre
UK pro max price increase of 150 is not ideal to say the least
Why is that campus completely devoid of employees during these events  I think its weird
Sierra Blue when are u returning
My wife and I are both dropping our iPhones 11s for these pros We were going to get base 14s but they got me with the Island That is super slick
"1450 in Germany 

Was really thinking about getting into the Apple ecosystem but not if Watch iPhone and AirPods will cost me 2300

Guess Ill say hello to Google Pixel"
Shame apple supports china when it comes to Taiwan issues
The purple seems a bit too dark
Holy fuck I am pumped
what the fuck is a dynamic island
In Japan with 2 years of Apple care the base storage 128GB model Pro Max will set you back 2000 inc tax 
Dynamic Island was the shing star of the whole event Such an elegant and clever use of space that makes a tangible improvement to the experience of using the phone Im seriously impressed and cant wait to get one
I dont understand what the Dynamic Island actually is or why its such an amazing feature From the article it just shows notifications Where is the dynamic island
Yup looks like the last one
Im pretty sure this will be my first iPhone pro but Im a little disappointed by the colours
Does dynamic island mean they occasionally purposely blacken part of the screen
I want it to have a super dark mode Fuck even brighter give me barely legible except in a blacked out room at midnight in the arctic on the 21st of December
I like the dynamic island  I think they should add a dynamic peninsula for the old notches as well
Does anyone know if the AOD actually shows you incoming and unread notifications I havent seen anything showing that and more just showing widgets
"Ive been waiting for a purple Pro MaxPlus for years 

But I upgraded last year "
Confirmed  Apple thinks Thanos was right hence the purple phone
I cant wait to get this thing for Christmas Will be switching from an Android for the first time so Im excited
They keep doing all this extra stuff but we still cant get simple features like a better Keyboard with a number row or the ability to close all open apps at once Or even somthing as simple as multiple audio sources so my music doesnt stop playing everything a webpage has an add that is on mute but hey dynamic island right
Does it have USBC
No USBC no reason to buy Till next year
They repurposed the touch bar UI and integrated into the notch very clever I admit Bravo Vince
allday battery life sounds interesting but if you have an alwayson display it makes sense
I fear this notch is going to be like the toolbar on the 2016 MacBook Proutter waste of time
Dynamic island is an awful name But love how they designed around it Really clever
Was really hoping this was the year to replace my 12 pro but no usbc Is a deal breaker at this point
They need to start releasing iPhone generations like game console generations
Imagine making a iPhone with ONLY eSIM and NOT USBC What a joke
Ill wait for iPhone 15 instead
I have noidea why people are happy about this  Its the same regurgitated shit as the last 3 years Little faster cpu you wont notice smaller notch so people know youre a pro and satalite for emergency that 99999 people wont use No USB C half ass redesign and killed the mini
"I am a samsung s21 ultra user here I was potentially thinking about switching to iphone as all my friends and family give me a tough time for not imessaging them

But switching to the iphone seems like an hassle tbh I travel a lot and constantly switch sim cards when abroad In fact I have a trip planned to Namibia this December Good luck trying to find esim services abroad Meanwhile my phone laptop camera drone power bank and everything charges with USBC I carry two cables max If I switch there is another cable to worry about

While I had hoped to switch using an iphone in my context seems like a headache tbh

Apple clearly innovates The satellite feature is really cool But it is appalling that they cant get the basic things right Come on Apple Stop making your things so difficult to use"
"Last Year my iPhone 13 Pro Max 256GB was at 1369 
This Year the iPhone 14 Pro Max 256GB is at 1579
Wow Apple"
"In light of Reddits decision to limit my ability to create and view content as of July 1 2023 I am electing to limit Reddits ability to retain the content I have created

"Still a notch  
Still no USB C  
My 11 Pro stays to fight for an other year"
All the features of the phone was good until they killed off the physical SIM In the times of traveling the physical SIM is still being used around the globe Even in US it is still not as widely adopted
D Y N A M I C I S L A N D
"So they keep us pricing but the UK gets shaftedthe pro starts at 1100 which is 1267 USDand thats not the plus size

I get inflation but jesus Christ stop pandering to just the us"
Im not sure about Dynamic Island  I think Black Hole would be more apt
I think its way thicker than those leaked pics but the interaction it has in the software is really cool Im scared of getting this and seeing it all the time unlike the notch which I never notice
Does it have a simcard tray or did they remove it on the pro series as well as the other phones That makes this a hard sell to anyone who travels regularly
They spend like 30sec talking about the A16 Bionic This does not look good for the M3
Definitely love the gorgeous purple color and Dynamic Island holy heck I am excited
Is it esim only now
I love the island and I love the purple and that it has an AOD Great product Contrary to the 14 which is shit
That dynamic island looks cool with the software bubble features
"I am currently on the 12 Pro Maxwhile I am tempted to upgrade to the 14 Pro Max and might if there is a good deal from TMobile like 1000 off with trade in I will probably wait till I get USBC next year on the 15 It will be much easier with my Sony headphones MacBook Pro iPad Pro Power banks etc 

x200B

It is honestly pretty irresponsible they are still using Lightning in todays age"
I was really rooting for Animation Archipelago
I legit gasped at the first animation on the island
I love the animations they added to the island My only question is if people are touching it wouldnt that smudge the front facing camera Or do you have to like not try to touch the camera
Apple finally embraced a new BT standard Bluetooth 53 for both the new iPhones and AirPods Pro
"So

A16

AlwaysOn display

Dynamic Island

New 48MP main camera

Emergency SOS via Satellite 

Crash Detection

A much better front camera with autofocus

Photonic engine 

1600 bits peak brightness HDR

2000 nits peak brightness in outdoors 

Bluetooth 53

And new purple finish

All of that with no price hike Awesome"
No notch is an island
Will the iPhone 14 Pro max work with 13 cases Or does the new camera mess with the dimensions
Weird The iPhone 14 has a longer battery life for audio playback playback than the 14 Pro 80 hours vs 75 hourshttpswwwapplecomiphonecomparemodelListiphone14iphone14plusiphone14pro
"Ive been bitching for years that companies need to use that space better And Ive been bitching that iOS needs better notifications

This kinda fixes the problem Maybe well get better notifications eventually 

Although if course with phones being massive no one can reach the fucking thing 

Rip mini"
I was hoping the carrier indicator and proper battery percentage would come back
Dynamic island is some shit Id see in a jailbreak tweak Im glad it came to the 14 pro
This is the best way to sell a notch imo kudos to the team that put this together Cant wait for iPhone 1516 when this comes to the base model
Shoutout to the jerk on the 9to5mac forums who told me multiple times that the pill now called the Dynamic Island was bad design and that Apple would never do it over the two cutouts that was rumored before The best part is when he finishes with No one at Apple is ever hiring you as a designer is what we learned here today Gotta love when people are condescending to this extent to you and then theyre proven blatantly wrong Heres the threadhttpdisqusp2m3mvnn wish it wasnt locked haha
Does the Deep Purple one come with a free download of Smoke on the Water
"1750 here in India up from the previous 1500 price point 

That dynamic island stuff does look cool af though"
The regular 14 does not worth upgrading to if you currently own a 1313 pro 14 pro does have intriguing features like AOD and satellite connection but I worried that for normal user price dropped 13 pro from a carrier might be a better option
"looks at dynamic island

looks at my undynamic notch"
Im actually disappointed the leaked bronze color was not real
Really not loving the new colors and I was thinking it might be time to replace my 11 pro
Too bad no mini version I like that mini option
Im wondering how the dynamic island works with landscape a mode I use a lot for browsing and video playback Because the notch is terrible and awful in landscape I truly wish I could just turn off the pixels to the side of it and make the apps think the screen is smaller
Going to stick with my 11 Pro for maybe 1 more year then Ill grab the 14 Pro Great job Apple
Iconic and how long until it gets copied
"Having the island further up as a smaller notch would of been far better

Great now instead of a big block notch we have a little island with a tiny amount of screen above it that will never serve a purpose "
So is the iPhone 14 P  the Pro or Plus now
"Yeah the weak euro has really made the prices incredibly high in Europe this year

Expect even worse in the coming years"
Dynamic island is a cool use of the punchout but its stupid it exists as a new feature Feels like something iPhones should already have
I wonder if it be shipped with iOS16
They need a idgaf if its a little thicker version so we can get the front camera behind screen and bigger battery and storage
Meh not impressed
"I really like their hardware but man i hate my ipad and work iPhone due to the limitations like adding my own music my own ringtones and the worse one forced to use safari even when is another browser its still safari 

If they ever relax with that I would jump all in but as it is Im jumping out"
The dynamic island looks amazing Will have to test it out in person But if its as smooth as the trailer I might have to finally move out of Samsung after 10 yrs Apples privacy announcement last yr has got me thinking hut this might be the push
No sim card 
Am I the only one that isnt a huge fan of this I forgot about the notch after a while But this is dead black space within the screen and a lot of it Would rather them have made the Pros like the 14s to take up less real estate There is less usable screen now
Any update if the ProRaw is still limited to the 256 GB phones
Cant wait for the prices to drop on other phones so I can buy a iPhone 6 
It looks pretty slick As a photographer the new camera is really enticing  but I picked up a 13 Pro last year so theres no real need to switch
Why didnt they move the island up against the top of the device
"Cant wait to see how the island works with shortcuts running compact UI notifications 

I am sick to death of those notifications covering up the UI Im actually trying to work with"
i was amazed by it totally shocked when seeing it makes me way excited to get it
No difference between pro and pro max other than screen size again right
All I want is my alarm clock on the lock screen
"This is a lot better than the leaked seperated pill plus camera design
I still would prefer if it was just a tiny notch on the top to waste less screen space but this is far better than what I thought it would be
Really the only other interesting part of the iphone this year is the 2000 nits Otherwise barely an upgrade from the 13 pro series which was already barely an upgrade from 12 outside battery life and promotion"
Not too keen on the esim though What if you break your phone and you need to use an old one temporarily while its getting fixed Now you cant move your sim over
The Dynamic Island is a cool compromise for the notch in 2022 would still prefer if it wasnt there
Ugh guys Im suddenly noticing how bad the notch looks on my phone after years of not perceiving it I hate what Apple marketing can do to my brain
I think its safe to assume that the notchdynamic island is here to stay for at least another 4 years
"Great for notification woefully for interactivity

Apple just moved notificationmusicwidgets all the way down in the lockscreen so its easy to reach now they will those miniwidgets very top part of the screen

Imagine trying to skippause something with a single hand on a propromax

All gimmick for something that should even be solved if the camera lived under the display as other phones"
Finally an IPhone that looks like a Covenant Plasma Pistol
Wish it came in more colors although the purple is nice wish there was more options aside from the goldwhite and black
So I never use always on for Android but its cool they have it
is there a way to preorder with tradein for pick up so i dont have to send my current iphone away in the mail i kinda dont wanna go without a phone until im syncing my current one into the new one
Are the making a pro mini yet
Ngl Im sad that they dropped the nice blue the base 13 has I love it so much 
Can someone please explain like Im 5 what the dynamic island is
I cant wait for people to smudge the front camera by constantly touching around up there lol
I have to be honest and I like the old notch better then this dynamic island It looks so off when watching a video Hopefully it gets smaller or gets completly removed by hiding everything behind the screen and switching to usbc by iPhone 16 since my guess is that they are keeping this identical with next years iPhone 15
As an android user can someone explain this to me  Im being completely serious I just dont understand what the big deal is with the dynamic island I just watched a little video by the verge on it and it basically seems like a different way to control stuff but it was the same as me just swiping down and controlling my music from the drop down menu I assume the iphone has something similar so why would you want a bigger black bar at the top instead of just a hole punch for the camera
Is having dynamic island better than notch I feel if you have notch you get uninterrupted screen view
Does it mean the user cannot use one hand to operate anymore coz the action area is moved to the top
Might actually upgrade from my iPhone 8 Plus at this point
Still no fingerprint sensorthe one feature Im still waiting for
Apple still out here charging premium price and not giving base models 120hz
I want this phone But not enough to pay the 1500 US it costs here Going to buy a new OLED TV instead
"As a software engineer the Dynamic Island is just an amazing feature

I want the 14 Pro but not sure I need to upgrade from my 11 Pro"
China You will be in awe of our dynamic islands in the South China Sea
The astroturfing in here is ridiculous Nearly every comment says Dynamic Island with exactly the correct punctuation and something about how great it is It looks like total shit Design is going backwards they are trying to sell a horrific compromise
Give us USBC already Im not upgrading my phone until then I dont care how much money they are making on lighting it is horrible for the environment and the consumer and each year they continue to use lighting just means that many more cables that will be thrown out when they do switch These phones are not future proof until they move to a universally recognized standard that the EU is essentially forcing them to move to
One of the most underwhelming announcements Ive ever seen from Apple The way they focused on the photo processing I knew they were out of innovation
"Hiding the notch behind a new function is honestly a genius idea
I hope the person who pitched it got a nice bonus"
Dynamic Island is cool but I think Ill stick to my 13 Pro 14 Pro would not make such a big difference
I dont know how popular this opinion is but I am quite a fan of the Dynamic Island silly name aside What theyve shown with it so far has been impressive and I cant wait to see what 3rd party apps manage to do with it
Not upgrading till my 12 blows up lol
I just hope this doesnt become the new touch bar
Missed a trick should have been dynamic iland
Question So will the Dynamic Island be the sole receiver of notifications or can you have both the island and onscreen notifications function at the same time And will they show up on the bottom of the lock screen on Pro models
149800 Japanese yen for the base 14 Pro Weak YEN
To utilise the 48MP camera do you have to shoot in ProRAW
why would I buy Iphone 14 instead of Iphone 13 That makes no sense
So is there any reason to believe that next years iPhone will actually have a USBC port I would like to upgrade to this 14 Pro Plus but if the iPhone 15 is going to have USBC then I think I can wait I have a iPhone 12 Pro Max right now but really like the Dynamic Island feature and better camera on the 14 Pro Plus
While keeping US price intact they also increased it in the EU by 200 Polish prices are even crazier as base iphone 14 costs exactly the same as iphone 13 pro which is better in almost every aspect
"Apple unveils phone costing 1329 Belgium  
WTF"
I swear to God if the next iPhone has two dot like cameras
Im looking forward to all the tech YouTubers testing the crash detection
I still dont understand where the from facing camera is
When pre ordering can I choose to pick up instore
I havent bought a new iPhone in 4 years Do they no longer ship with charging cables I heard they dont ship with charging bricks anymore but was expecting a usb c cable to be included Super pumped for pre order tomorrow
Removal of the physical SIM card tray is a huge bummer
"I really like Reddits comments compared to any other social medias comments on this phone or anything regarding apple

They are civil and constructive You can respect what apples doing without having to make snarky remarks regarding competing technologies People seem to take it personally as to what apple and any phone brand does better"
Well damnit I just got a 13 and purple is my favorite thing
I just want a phone that has that same sleek matte silvery purple that the sides of my 12 has on its back as well
I only want this iPhone for the purple color 
My 11 is going strong  I might toss it in the lake so I can claim on my insurance and get a new phone
Id like to upgrade from my 11 Pro Max but Im not that motivated to spend money
Seeing as I havent gotten a new phone since the 8 Im thinking its upgrade time
The pill is a 4D chess 200IQ move Pretty sure well see every Android OEM implementing something similar on notchless phones in a month lol
Still rocking my iPhone 5 When it goes I go back to a chorded wall phone
"This year we can have the Large size without having to go mandatorily to the Pro Max version I know the 14 Pro Max is the best but for a given budget would you pick the 14 Plus or the 14 Pro no max  
  
I watch a lot of videos and battery life is also important I make horrible photos whichever the phone I have So Id goy for the 14 Plus but would I miss the Dynamic Island"
I like The Future Island
Another iPhone and another year I will stick with my XS Max
Hope they integrates it to the normal iPhone 15
Sodoes the deep purple Pro come with Deep Purples discography
Great I can finally consider upgrading to the iPhone 12
I wonder how well the dynamic island will function on the pro max I want the pro max but it will be so hard to reach that far up the screen
Im trading my note 20 Ultra 5G to get this beast And airpods pro
At least we can agree that weve prepared for the pill but the island came out of syllabus
I hope they resolve this issue by 2024 A fully clean under the screen camera slab phone
Gonna get the 14 pro max coming from XS MAX
"I wonder if the screen stays on all night as well What if its face down

Having it always on is cool but I dont know if it really needs to always be on"
Real question is which colour are you guys buying Im stuck between silver space black and deep purple
The one thing I was looking forward to was USBC and it didnt happen Were still stuck with lightning for iPhone and USBC for macs and iPad Makes no sense Going to stick with my iPhone 12 pro for another year I think
Genuine question but why did Apple make the dynamic island with 2 separate cutouts and not combine it to make the overall width of the dynamic island shorter Is there a reason why they left it like that Was it because of hardware limitations
Do we think dynamic island will eventually be on all iPhone models Or will that always be a Pro only feature
I am most curious about that 2x zoom camera if it is any good at all Using the center 12MP means they cannot do pixel binning but it is also the distance I expect to shoot most of my photos at
Am I the only one how has spotted two lights in the dynamic island in the iPhone 14 pros commercial One to indicate if the camera is on and one to indicate if the microphone is on
So question for the masses I have iPhone 11 Pro Max I cant charge my phone with cord for some reason can only charge using wireless Battery doesnt last as long as used to Do I upgrade or wait for IPhone 15 and hope by then they have switched to USB type C since I hate lightning Should I try and wait a year or get new phone this year
Is it just coincidence that I updated my iPhone 11 after daily reminders just as the 14 came out and now my phone is noticeably slower with worse battery life
Thinking of swapping my 13 pro max for the 14 pro Gone through the reviews and it seems like a downgrade batterywise but an upgrade in all other specifications What do you guys think Would you make the same choice if you had the same option available to me Thanks
Dynamic Island is Applespeak for We couldnt get rid of the cutout in the display so we hid it with fancy animations
This might be my long term iPhone 13 was almost there but this might do it for me
them raising the price in europe by 200eur is incredibly disappointing ill keep my 13 pro max
"Am I the only one not impressed by this

They made things pop in and out of it Thats all

Or am I missing something"
"How do people actually like this Its ugly for full screen content

At least with the cutout from last gen you could have 2 black bars on the side 

I guess nobody watches videos on their phone"
"dyNamiC IsLaNd


Interesting name"
That Island would be sexier with a usbc port
dynamic island UI is INCREDIBLE
"In typical Apple fashion they immediately show you why you should care about the pill 

And man that purple is nice "
Disappointed with the size I have an 11 Pro just now and its the perfect size for my hands
Ok im upgrading from my iphone 8
Dynamic Island sounds like a failed band
"Dynamic IslandROFL What a joke

x200B

ButI like it"
"Coming from an iPhone 12 Pro 256GB

You guys think its worth the upgrade to the iPhone 14 Pro 5121TB"
"Dynamic Island is absolutely ingenious it now makes total sense why they wanted it to be one long pill 

I hate this term but Im going to use it its a gamechanger"
The satellite emergency SOS is such a big deal I spend a lot of time in the Colorado mountains and Utah desert and without signal most of the time make sure to carry a personal locator beacon if Im backpacking or backcountry skiing But thats a 350 device that doesnt have any more granularity in its message than send help and isnt something I carry around on the regular Having a phone always on me that can do this makes the upgrade worth it alone StarlinkTMobile will start to come online in a year or two but bridging the gap will save lives and give me much more peace of mind
"Coming from an iPhone 11 Pro the combo of features make this an extremely compelling upgrade

 Emergency satellite SOS

 24x storage space

 5g cellular

 3x optical zoom macro shots better camera processing

 18  23 hours battery for video playback

 Alwayson display

 The 11 Pro is still selling for 400 on swappa so I can get a good chunk of sticker price back

I dont care around the magsafe charging or lidar or display refresh ratebrightnesssize updates but its really remarkable what difference 3 years makes"
Lol the base 13 actually went up in price in my country
Ok is that it Honestly until they get rid of the camera bumps that stick out a full foot from the back of the phone Im just not interested
　　
"Absolute joke that the notch is as big as it is in 2022 

The comments here are absurd Its so the camera quality isnt degraded have any of you touched an android phone recently The experience lacks in many ways but camera quality isnt one of them

No amount of rebranding or animations hides how lazy the entire effort is"
"Missed Opportunity

The Lonely Island"
LOL these prices for the pro are just insane WOW
Damn people are losing their mind over fancy animations And then they wonder why Apple sheep is a term
Fingerprints will be all over the front facing camera from Dynamic Island interactions Not great design choice for a flagship device in my view
Apple is shilling hard in this thread
This is the most unnecessary iterative upgrade like maybe ever
All that space and still no battery percentage lmao
I guess this is using esim only too This is the only deal breaker for me
To all the people complaining about prices they are still the same but because of the currency exchange rates and inflation  just guessing dont hound me  the price must have risen  Its actually amazing that they didnt increase the price
Purple IRL from iJustinehttpswwwinstagramcomreelCiN2PZ3LfzvigshidYmMyMTA2M2Y
"I just added alwayson lock screen widgets to Weathergraph If a detailed hour by hour weather forecast on the lockscreen makes your day brighter Ill publish the update as soon as iOS 16 is out
Sneak peek httpstwittercomweathergraphstatus1567621358992982016

Also the new notch and purple color is dope but honestly the AW Ultra is the star of the show for me"
Nice euphemismIm just gonna call it dead island since its centered around a dead area of the screen
Somehow theyve made a worse notch Bravo
This looks like my 100 Motorola Youre all hecking delusional
"glad I skipped the 13

this event was honestly probably the best thing Ive seen in quite some time not just boring incremental upgrades everything announced is useful to me and solves a problem I have getting the watch ultra new airpods and the 14 pro"
Dynamic Island when you cant get rid of a problem you make it a feature
Imagine how dirty the lens will be from constantly touching it
Dynamic island is pretty cool but other than that theres no major update over iPhone 1312
Ugh which color I like the purple but not sure if Ill get sick of it Maybe it will be subtle enough but still interesting Best color was pacific blue from the 12
I needed a video to understand the concept of the dynamic island I still dont understand what the purple color option is about though
Apple makes the same phone 4 years in a row
Linus made a good point People are gonna always have fingerprint smudges on their front facing cameras now
yes but httpsimgurcomaKPvlEfjhttpsimgurcomaKPvlEfj
This guys accent is crazy
48 megapixel camera yassssss
Uh I enjoyed watching this event The Dynamic island is just sick I am obsessed Apple killed it once again Smart sleek innovative My wallet is ready price is fair I was expecting that tbh
My 11 Pro Max works flawlessly Full day and just over 50 battery Not even sure the 14 Pro would do anything I need my 11 Pro doesnt yet I want it Curse you Apple
"The dynamic island is nothing more than some animation around the existing black notch As you can see there is still nothing displayed on the actual black space  
Its a smart ui design but adds no functionality than just giving small notifications at the top of your screen"
The fact that the second part of the headline mentions a new color tells you all you need to know about how uneventful this upgrade is
If anyone other than Apple came up with this ugly cutout they would be mocked But Apple did it so its automatically great
I dont where guy who talks about photo is from but he sounds like a russian villain parody
When was the last time Apple sold us a phone instead of a fancy camera Seriously they talk more about the cameras than anything else Yawn Wheres the innovation I see improvements which are great but nothing WOW
The Dynamic Island is just a better Touch Bar
Congratulations Im keeping my 12 Pro
"So Features androids had 10 years ago  
And that notch Wtf Might as well just cut the whole top out and make it static Just a black notification bar Lol The damn notch is pretty much the whole width "
they didnt even increase the price wasnt expecting that at all
Super smart way to disguise the space Cant wait to see it on Samsung phones soon 
I watched the stream Its incredibly underwhelming and incredibly expensive
Dynamic island going the way of Force Touch in 2 years
Dynamic island is game changing Im going to upgrade from my iphone 13 pro
Everyone drooling over the DI but letting the fact they kept lightning in there slide
Yawn
"999 starting looks like the leakers got the price hike wrong

But this definitely almost certainly means the price will increase next year maybe"
Not bad I guess
same phone from last year
Does this phone have usb c
iPhones for people who are overly sensitive how they are viewed by others
This is the Apple that Ive been missing  The dynamic island is probably one of the coolest things ever  Ive been on android for so long but now this is making me think of switching
Saw this in the Apple Event Why did they have a sad 13yearold girl with a smokers rasp narrate the recap What does she know about gyroscopes and car crashes Are they just trying to upsell kids on the 1000 iPhone
Not really a big fan of the dynamic island I suspect that most of the time it will be a useless black blob that is more noticable than the notch It also seems to be aligned a bit further downward than the notch
All of what android is and was catch up
Wait so iPhone 14 doesnt get the latest processor but the pro does
Are we going towards a circle as a screen Rounded corners feel like a toy They should just make them squares
Is that thing purple Purple is my favorite color
funny how the original rumor was two silly LED lights but now we see what it really does and its so much more
I want to hear from the pill critics
"Why wouldnt they just move the pill up to the edge and make a smaller notch 

This looks really weird and even more distracting for watching videos 

No one wants to live on the Dynamic island apple  you are throwing people in it"
what no fuckin ziti voice no iphone 14 mini
"Dont know about anyone else but I feel like this dynamic island will be far to distracting for me I have adhd so concentrating on reading text or watching video is hard enough without constant animating icons for music etc 

Rather glad that they didnt introduce anything too new so I can keep my current iPhone 13 pro max"
Really like the dynamic island but hating no sim tray
"I am just disappointed theyre sticking with the Lightning port  

The camera is a nice upgrade"
"Satellite connection is amazing Having a feature like this is very futuristic I like what TMobile is doing with Starlink too but this works just as well

The 14 Plus is going to sell like hotcakes People who didnt want to spend 1100 for the Pro Max will all pick one up Some 14 customers will upgrade to the Plus 

Also I love the fact that they didnt raise prices despite everyone doing so It shows that Apple hit the sweet spot for pricing and once the macro conditions improve they can make an incremental adjustment next year"
I wish the notch touched the tip of the top feel like it stands out too much
The Dynamic Island is so sexy omg
I wanna upgrade from my 13 Pro just for the Dynamic Island
"Instead of dynamic island they should have named it iland

Thank me later Apple hire me for the iPhone 15 "
Leave it to apple to call a camera cutout the Dynamic Island lol I love it though
NO USB C I wont buy another lightning connector  Im going to android
Product Designer here Cant wait to explore design guidelines and experiment with the Dynamic Island
Watching vids with the dynamic island is going to be more annoying than the notch I cant be the only one whose eyes instantly darted to the void while they were playing any movies or video on it
I have wanted a dedicated space for notifications that does not obscure apps FOR OVER TEN YEARS I AM SO HAPPY except it doesnt include all notifications BUT THAT CAN CHANGE lol I used to jailbreak and force notifications into the status bar lmao
The Dynamic Island is the coolest new feature in years tbh
All of a sudden the current system of a colored pill behind the time seems so bizarre The Dynamic Island interface is genuinely cool
It seems satellite and eSIM only options are not available on Italian models Prices are insanely high
Its kinda funny how awesome they make their cameras and video features while having one of the worst slowest transfer ports possible Swap to USB C already you fucks
But is it usbc
I gotta say thats a very clever software innovation
Just saw a video of the purple color What a disappointment Barely looks like purple
Thanks another stupid ass notch
No usb C
iPhone 7 Plus user here I think I will wait one more year Still pretty cool
Am I the only person here that doesnt care about the dynamic island Theres nothing wrong with it but it doesnt seem that great
Purple is not it
it looks so good definitely getting it
"scans for USBC

Nope still waiting for the 15"
Stunning and brave
We cultured people call it the Yass pill Not a dynamic island
NO WAY A PURPLE COLOR OPTION s Jesus Christ
"I told myself the 13 Pro is so nice I have no idea what could justify an upgrade no way Im selling just get a better camera

But this is pretty goddamn impressive Android had years to do the same thing and never did if its obvious afterwards but didnt exist for years coming up with it is genius"
Wtf is dynamic island
No SIM card USA no upgrade
Really wish they didnt cut out the physical sim for US models I use esim right now but its always nice to have the physical sim there for backup
Absolutely disappointing This is not acceptable I am pretty sure all these features are being held back and released each year just to take peoples money I am very disappointing
No mini  no upgrade
"Purple color option Well hot dam sign me up for 1500 worth of debt for a color Thats totally the main selling point of this device and deserves the spotlight
s"
Am I the only one not impressed I get that the dynamic island is a nice feature but I dont see it as such a wow factor or justifying an upgrade Its also the only real change Everything else is more or less the same
"I have to admit as a designer I love the idea of the Dynamic Island Im mildly disappointed havent backported it to older notches with iOS 16 designwise it should work nearly just as well

x200B

But yeah the naming is slightly awkward Would love to see a movie with that title though"
Cant wait for the front camera to be smudged 247
is it just me or is the purple very underwhelming it just looks grey in most pictures
"

DYNAMIC 

ISLAND"
"This going to be my first iPhone ever

I cant wait to clown the rest of my family members by hiding shit behind their notch in pictures since they all just got on the iPhone 13s despite me telling them to wait"
Idk still looks dated and somehow fat as well NGL
No folding option Pass These new models are already outdated
"yes but

httpsimgurcomnN2xR1chttpstwittercom01egmestatus1567889779127209992s20t9b8GpVnu2HEdYGZWZ2MzqA"
Huge pass
Does anyone else think the dynamic island is cool but for a lot of people it wont ever be touched because its at the top of the screen and you need two hands for it when swiping at the bottom to switch apps is faster
Does it have fast charging and if so is it finally close to something like 60W
What changes on the regular iphone 14 then
but will it still have the feature that makes the screen dimmer and dimmer when you do pro things
Okay conclusion phone mediocre Software  UI awesome
The renders looked better
Why do so many people are upset about the lack of  USB C It was pretty clear there will be no USB C on the 14 Also the EU law for this will come into effect only in 2024 and even then Apple has another 2 years of transition phase
Tbh cringe af
Cant innovate anymore my ass
"90 of the comments here can be summarized with I MUST CONSOOOOM

Americans really are something else jesus Also every comment critising some detail is downvoted to hell When did reddit become so astroturfed Only way to navigate nowadays is sorting by controversial"
Awwww yissssss cant wait to immediately slap a case on my new DYNAMIC ISLAND eliminating all trace of colorrrrr
Yall drinking the koolaid hard thinking that notch notification is good thing Itll go the way of the touch bar
"I really dont like how the look of that thing constantly changes I hope we can turn that shit off Also no idea how this is gonna work with screen protectors 

Looks weird as hell I liked the i shaped version way better"
The new iPhone is so different and better Theres a notch that you can move cums
"Ummm

httpsphandroidcom20220907applesinnovativedynamicislandisanoldandroidtrickfrom7yearsago"
Dynamic island is what my wife calls her coochie
every mobile app better put their search bars and shit at the bottom now
Apple still managing to be shit
The same shit more money
Dynamic crap The whole point of smart UI is to keep all the critical elements close to your thumb at the bottom section of the screen
"This shouldve been how the notch ALWAYS was 

When iPhone X came out and everyone was bitching about how crap full screen video looked I literally thought well they have the time and all the little widgets up there already Why not just make it a straight black bar with software all the time no matter the app and use the black space on either side for in app stuffa permanent clock IMO that would still be the best option But Ill take this Better than the bitch I think and I dont really even mind it"
"So its an animated multiapp widget designed to hide the fact they havent fixed the NotchHolepunch camera situation

Absolutely baffling Its just another part of the interface truly truly baffling"
"LAME

Dynamic Island  You serious Apple
Give the people what they want
Borderless notchless islandless full front screen with camera under the screen  

And get rid of the damn camera protrusion on the back

Apple suckering fanboys to buy there garbage year after year great snake oil salesmen"
Dynamic island might be a nod to Taiwan who manufactures 90 of their chips
Are we really cheering on apple for 3 year old screen tech
"Incredible how it took Apple 5 years to figure out a notchless phone and even then they had the nerve to lock a cleaner display behind a more expensive model aka wait for iPhone 15 next year where DI will actually be a standard feature across all products

such a scummy move but then again its Apple"
So rebrand the notification bar and sell it for a premium 
And it really irritates me when MKBHD is wow about this island shit Really  Why is he become like this
"Dynamic Island I orgasmed when I saw its pro features and animation capabilities 

Yes to all the above"
"The Dynamic Island is garbage Why do I want  a video playing behind the DI

EDIT  I see the Apple bootlickers are in full force here How is playing a video behind the DI a good thing"
Wow Apple has convinced their fans that their inability to keep up with their competition is actually an innovative improvement Im speechless
Its PuRPle NeWw  The masses
"So the 14 its basically the same the major upgrade is only on the Pro version its mostly UIwise where they integrated visually the most obnoxious part of the phone thats clever but we also passed the 1k cap   
Not sure this is enough to justify the price and nont only that its not something sustainable in the next future"
So Dynamic Island is a notch with a black box displayed around it
"lmao

The things iphone people care about Apple knows their target demographic are insecure and status conscious"
One of the things keeping me to Andriod is not having 144hz on iPhone Whats the consensus on that Do you think theyll ever add it
I wasnt too fond of the pill over notch didnt see much change but damn that is nice
Ok That was enough Im in for Watch ultra and iPhone 14 pro max
I LIKE THIS DESIGN
Do we think the dynamic island is here to stay Initially I thought this would just be a one model thing but they are leaning very hard into it I told myself I wanted to wait until they got rid of the notchdynamic island completely before upgrading but Im scared itll take too long
Anyone know what time the preorders are going to be available on Friday Any ideas if theyll sell out
dynamic still better then watch Ultra next year it will be Megatron
The biggest news is that the price did not increase Thanks Tim Apple
Is AOD coming to older phones
IM READY I want the pro max in silver will do trade in and that ultra watch I also want the older iPad from last year and a MacBook
So I have the 13 Pro Max I didnt get to watch the event should I upgrade
As a UI designer this dynamic island thing is incredible but as a user I cringe at the name and presentation of this feature
Apart from Action Cam mode Is there much point in getting an iPhone 14 over iPhone 13 Pro
"This is pretty much like everyone figured 

Not a major upgrade unless youre using something like a 11 or below 

I rather hate the pill more than the notch due to that thin line of display But other than that AOD is just software any phone can use and everything else is just a minor bump"
You misspelled iPhone 13 Pro with a dynamic island and purple color option
"Thats a whole lot of nothingness

sent from my iPhone 12 which I bought because my 6S died"
The dynamic island is giving me anxiety with the way it moves and looks to change sizes Anyone else feel uneasy for some reason
Apple still expect subscriptions To use your hardware
Are we really wowed by this
If it works as good as the demonstration then theyve solved the notch problem and given it a unique spin Ill be upgrading for the alwayson and this feature
Id have preferred the island to just be a smaller notch I dont think they gain anything by separating the notch from the bezel as now there is a small sliver of pixels between the island and the bezel that doesnt really do anything
i thought the  camera cutout was stupid when i heard the leaks but seeing how they implemented im pleasantly surprised
I loved everything this phone had to offer but its too soon to kill physical SIM cards
"How will it handle video Will there just be a hole in the middle of the screen lmao

Seems like a huge waste of space

The notch is floating closer to the middle of the screen than the real notches do So they would have to add thick black bars for video

I think its either there is a notch or there isnt This in between is it a notch or is it not a notch thing is the worst of both worlds"
Do they really still use lightning as the charger Hard no from me then Was hoping they finally make the switch to usbc with this one
How many months will this one last before apple bricks it with their shit software
"I was dreading the pill punch replacing the notch because the notch is much easier to ignore since theres nothing above it 

Dynamic Island though Consider my opinion completely flipped Thats genuinely the first audible oh shit Apple have gotten from me in a good couple of years at least One of those features which only Apple can really do because of the hardwaresoftware integration"
Just wait until everyone starts complaining about how the new iPhone 14 Pro frontfacing camera has issues with blurry photos   
lol you fanboys would literally buy a turd with an apple on it wouldnt you lol
Kinda funny Samsung already formated themselves to only having tiny circle just big enough for the camera lens all the while Apple still has a notch So much for that master of innovation Not mention how excited people were for AOD which just drains your battery and has been around since 2017 just not for Apple
Cant believe people are simping for this Not even changing the cpu Goes holding out for another year
"Maybe Im nitpicking but I hate that they made the main camera even wider The subjects are gonna look so distorted

The 2x 48mm mode sounds like marketing"
"The white elephant in the room

Landscape mode"
Damn I really just want touch id is it so hard to put both in really I thought covid would have made them rethink the only use the face for unlock But no apple has to move forward even if the tech sucks Here we are using shitty touch screens instead of good ol reliable dont have to look at the screen buttons
Wow The island is such a gimmick They could do nearly the same thing with the current notch if they wanted
We should have saw this coming based on how Apple would hide the notch in past UI designs lol
So Wtf Six cameras didnt work So a colorful change that we will all block with an otter box was their next go to The good idea fairy at apple had a huge stroke and no one is concerned
Its like Touch Bar meets iPads context mouse interactions really beautiful
I mean they could do the cool animation stuff to the notches too
"Literally everyone Hey Apple can you remove the notch

Apple How about we task our developers with making iOS work around the notch instead but like intimately

I will never understand why Apple chooses to fix very simple problems with overly complicated workarounds that almost certainly cost more than fixing the problem itself"
Wait whats different
Dynamic island is a game changer Now  Androidians will tey to xopy hit
I dont think the dynamic island will work good when we watching movies or content i think itll disturb the content  may be the old notch design us much better than this i think not my decision
When I saw the leaks It looked awful and I was begging for them to not release it but at the event I totally changed my mind its honestly a genius idea
1400 dollars with basically no improvements Typical apple
The dynamic island looks like the s10 punch hole but centered And they called it innovative lmfao
New year same shit
Im really curious about how the satellite SOS stuff works Who owns the satellites
"Another year I dont upgrade my iPhone

I just want a USBC charging point "
iPhone 15 usbc
Would you pick Black or Silver for the iPhone 14 pro
Samsung zfold is where its at
Gonna wait for the 16 pro max since I hear it has better capabilities like a headphone jack
Its crazy that this event happened today  I didnt get a single notification didnt see anything about it on Instagram Twitter YouTube nothing Thats never happened before for me personally I think Apple is losing people by releasing the same hardware every year with only slight changes Even now that Ive seen the rundown of stuff they released nothing interests me
Fapple fans for the next 50 years Wooooooooow So InNoVaTiVe AnDrOiD sUcKz
Its a punch hole with extra steps
the notch ahem dynamic island is still stupid
Same refurbished shit for 300 price increase and still primitive  good job Apple
Same as iPhone 13 which was same as iPhone 12
Is the only new thing about this phone the number and the colours it comes in
"If Apple is going to leave that ugly gap between the camera and speaker they should utilize it by making the battery status a circular green progress bar around the camera Perhaps a graphic around the speaker for the wificellular strength 

Funny how 13d ago I was downvoted for describing what would become Dynamic Island Wheres my cookie"
"This must be the most stupid gimmick ever 
No innovation for three years now"
"Holy shit Apple fans what is wrong with you The stories about you guys were true 

Omg a notch animation will the world ever be the same again I must upgrade"
Confirmed on the website no USBChttpsiimgurcomoE2Z47ppng
I feel like theres no real tricks up a iPhones sleeve these days ngl Dynamic island is cool and all so is all the camera stuff ill never use full but a fold 4 seems alot more interesting to me
"I really dont get the hype behind dynamic island Its neat but doesnt really seem like a big deal 

The notification changes are definitely nice though"
So no 8k video 
Could of went with an underdisplay camera and still had this dynamic island
Its a cute trick Ya know what would be better No missing screen spot
Why should I care about this Whats the difference between a dynamic island and a permanent display widget
"My 6s lasted me 4 years my iPhone 11 Pro started acting up after 2  

So when I have to reluctantly get this new iPhone 14 I guess the best I can hope for is 2 solid years of use 

sigh thanks Apple"
its always the same shit
Cant wait to watch yall spend money you dont have to upgrade just because
Anybody still buying iPhone It is such a soulless experience
This is such a stupid design Samsung phones have a hole punch display and we made the notch that no one likes even bigger
Cool but still doesnt make me want to buy an iPhone
Wow purple Android is better
Is it gay to get the purple Iphone everyone 
"Without wanting to brag androids notification bar has pretty much the same functionality as the dynamic island And it had that since the start

Weve also had always on displays for over half a decade but i think thats common knowledge"
I wonder how the dynamic island related UI will look like on older devices eg iPhone 13
Purple color option That is just beyond revolutionary Should leave all competition in the dust for years to come If only Albert Einsteve were here to see his vision finally come true And so soon too Please Lord send us Your only adopted son so he can have this moment with all hollering humankind
Hey here are some cool new features and new chip but hey if you want it you gotta pay up
I scrolled so hard trying to find whether it had USBC or not Turns out it doesnt have one LOL  what a disgrace of a company telling other its oh so innovative
Huh

So Dynamic island Thats the new name for the notchwhy do these guys get paid
"Gives a new name to a feature Android had for like 15 years calls it Apple unique 

On the sidenote all the leaks seem to be wrong regarding the design of the front the notch is still there basically they just added like 1 pixel worth of LEDs between cutout and edge Still very wide cut and not split in two like in leaks which leads me to believe thats actually iPhone 15 patent

Also the price the recommended price is a joke 999 on presentation but sold by Apple for 1500 in Sweden"
Only Apple market this as a feature
Oh boy the new planned obsolescence phone thats gonna be release for 3 more years with the same feature How exciting
So do apple users ever get tired of the copy paste every year of their smartphones
Lol fancy Name
"Not really a fan of the camera quality of the 14 lineuppro and nonpro Every time they switched to showing the photos from the iPhones the images didnt look that great A lot of halos very splotchy skin like someone got an awful makeup job and just washed out Only one shot they showed looked decent Some of the videos they showed looked very washed out and compressed Doesnt look like a good camera system for taking photos of people Seemed like a downgrade

When they had the scene with the woman standing in the center and switched to the iPhone photo for a second it looked really bad

There also seemed to be a few inconsistencies With action mode on the video looked different more saturated and brighter compared to the off mode"
"Reading through reactions makes me feel like I slipped through the looking glass The dynamic island is a cool mixture of hardware and UI but its still based on a piece of hardware that I dont want What am I supposed to do with the few extra pixels I now have between my notch and the edge of the screen 

Why is there an island in the middle of my fullscreen pictures and video at all Is there an explanation I missed for why a pill cutout is necessary or beneficial"
Imagine being such a fan boy for a phone that it being purple was the selling point lol
This subreddit is a cancer lmao Stop worshiping apple
Dynamic Island I chuckled but I know they are probably right
When is this available via FF EPP discount D
48mp camera lol what is this man bring back the mini
Looks sick Although I would prefer no bezel or notch this makes it functional
The video introduction has Euphoria vibes
Its like a little mouth that yells at you I love it
Does anyone know how much heavy or lighter 14pro will be compared to iphone 11
Me watching on my 8 interesting
Fair pricing for the lower end models to be fair
Love that but no plan to upgrade from 12 pro max
I was honestly not expecting the pill cutout to steal the show The dynamic island is such a pleasantly slick and very Apple design element
No announcement so assuming the base will be 128gb again
how do preorders work for apple stuff Is it just a midnight drop
I wonder if the annoying low battery alert will still be covering the full screen in 14 Pro after all these years 
The dynamic island really reminds me of how notifications worked on WebOS
The fact that it is the same price as last year is amazing This phone is probably gonna sell like crazy
Are there any upgrades with the front camera as rumoured or is it only main camera upgrades
Mmm  Purple
How much is the 14 pro max Did they announce it I missed it
Cant wait for someone to make a dck out of that thing Lol
If you preorder on the 9th when its available does it arrive by the 16th when it goes on sale officially or does it ship on the 16th I cant remember how iphone preorders work
Somebody please explain to me if the battery will be better then the iphone13 battery or at least similiar
If the island is interactive then wont it be a bit off if using it during calls or camera use
Inspired from The Lonely Island Comedy trio D
I will call it notch
I REALLY like it but its 150 more expensive than the iPhone 13 Pro and still only has 128GB storage
I Hope that the always on is highly personalizable
Lets hope battery life is a good for the Pro Max model as it was on the 13 Pro Max
"	When IPhone is turned face down or in your pocket it goes dark to save battery life

Fuck yeah Ill use it not like on my Apple Watch"
Im calling it the iPhone Protein
Is esim the standard for carriers I think thats the thing holding me back from upgrading Physical sim cards are easy enough lol
Will the connect to any carrier iPhone option come with sim tray
Pro and Apple Watch 8 were the show stealers Definitely what Im picking up
When I saw the intro I didnt think that was possibly what it was doing and just fancy editing Damn it looks cool and fresh
Gimme dat Pro Max
"HELP Can anyone let me know if I can pre order the new phone and have the trade in take place in the store or do I HAVE to mail it in 

If I chose to pick up in store will it let me trade in store"
Need a phone with a physical SIM so Im looking at models from other countries Seems like the biggest difference is band support specifically for mmWave Is mmWave a US exclusive or are there other countries that support it
Looks so nice
Will this be the year I switch to an iPhone It all depends on how much my carrier will give me for an s21
I guess Im buying myself a private island
I am interested
God isnt that shit huge
"Now I need to know how much Ill get trading in my 13 Pro

Edit its 600 for 13 Pro 256GB"
Ill be preordering the Prince Purple iPhone 14 Pro Max on Friday for sure Not going to pick up a new Apple Watch for a couple of months since the Series 8 isnt much different from my Series 7
Anyone have an idea of when preorders are expected to go live on Friday Also what to expect on shipping times
The Dynamic Island is a pretty cool little feature but what a dumb fuking name
Anyone know if the camera bump is bigger than the 13 pro
Im curious how the dynamic island software will look with a screen protector I also wonder how these screen protectors will be manufactured whether theyll stick with a notch or make a pill shaped hole although I would think that for glass screen protectors the thin glass above the island would be a weak spot
"14 Pro is a few grams heavier than the 13 Pro 

Probably heavier camera"
"Why does it cost 999 but 1099
Where is that extra 23038 as 999  86862"
"I was really hoping to see usb c they said see at one point and even the notch shape had me convinced

Damn"
No green 
Is it going on sale at midnight PST Friday
Is the glas over the pill touchable
man i hate that they released the phones so late last year so now my upgrade is at the end of october
Still lightning port
No wonder it stayed the same price Still 128 gb
Lightning connector  Damnit Apple you had 1 job to do
Looks cool but sticking with my 13 Pro Max for another year
Is it lightning or USBC
Do preorders work the same if your choosing the payment plan option
Looks like the trade in values this year dropped Looking at my purchase history they gave 79000 for my iPhone 12 Pro Max It is 720 for the iPhone 13 Pro Max this year
Is there an international version with physical sim
Anyone know the actual specs for the cameras Im looking for sensor size
Lame
Colors schemes are so annoying Like I always buy Pro but I want some fun colors that base iPhones have 
I gotta say I love this use of the pill Ready to preorder the 14 Pro Max on Friday looking forward to it
Do the Dynamic Island features somehow adapt to the notch iPhones or is it only for the iPhone 14 Pros
Got a 13Pro 3 months back This 14Pro marketing video is making me skeptical What are your views on an upgrade
Any news on the Freeform app
That is something to get excited about It is amazing that the leaks are always right but no way they could have figured this out
Dropped green and blue from the Pro lineup Dropped the Mini from the base lineup Pretty lame announcement overall Was planning to get a 14 Pro to replace my 12 Mini that gets terrible battery life Will probably just find a deal on a 13 Pro instead
For those who went from regular to a Plus size phone why  My eyesight is getting worse and my sausage fingers feel more prone to mistakes when typing  Wondering if bumping up would help much
That dynamic island looks sick
Did anyone got the new iPhone wallpapers
Will the pill improve my phone porno experience
Isnt this pill is taller than 13s notch It takes more space vertically it seems
"At first Gross pill notch

Then Those notifications make up for it"
When does the review embargo lift
No SIM card slot what a joke
Damn you Apple for making us west coasters your own people wake up at 5am on fridays for pre order
Are the leaks even true about how the camera indicatormic indicator is on the Dynamic Island when in use Apples iPhone page shows otherwise
I wanna see it in person but it looks sleek for sure  The thing Im most excited about is the screen brightness As somebody who uses their phone outside in the sun itll be nice to hopefully be able to see it
Clever and innovative design But Im not sure if it will make it an eye sore as compare to the current notch which somewhat blends in with the screen and not just a lonely hole in the top center Its more noticeable in video mode Anyway its a cool featuregimmick just like the touch bar on the Macs Still no USBC hmmm so its not a hard yes for me
SoS as usual 
I have the 12 PM but this years iPhone definitely seem upgrade worthy
I really hope the Apple Leather cases are fixed this year I havent bought one in so many years because of how easy they slip off in the corners
Question about the 14 Pro Main Sensor Does anyone know how the depth of field compares to the 13 Pro The sensor is larger but the aperture is now at f178 instead of f15 on the 13 Pro I like the natural Bokeh you get on the 13 without the use of Portrait mode
Anyone have an idea when the iPhone 13 price will drop in the UK
Ok so emergency feature only available in the US but if I buy a pro in the Uk and then go back to the states will the feature work or is it specific to where I buy it
Finally They make good use of the notch I wish Apple would implement something similar for all notched iPhones past  present
I wonder what color theyll choose for the midyear drop
I like the new purple color and the new dynamic island looks good But getting rid of the SIM card tray destroys the possibility of getting this phone for me
Im glad its a dark purple definitely gonna get a clear case IF I buy it Uk price is 100 more any ideas why
One thing I was surprised by No SIM card Does this mean they cant be resold
I need it
The dynamic island looks rly cool but for usability I wonder if it will be difficult especially with pro max Constantly having to reach for the very top of the screen seems like more effort
Okay but whats up with 2022 and Purple phones
Whats the size of the pill cutout compared to the iPhone 12 notch Does anybody know
"So will the 13 pro max cases and screen protectors fit the 14 pro max 

Surely they wont try and do a screen protector around the pill"
No mention of battery usage
"the notch implementation is quite neat the name however sounds like they are trying to appease the trendy and hipster crowd  

x200B

it sounds silly"
Everyone dick riding because its a better camera like they always say and they claim that shit at the top is gonna work LoL
Im an Island Phone
I am being thick and dont understand Can someone ELI5
Is was gonna upgrade from my XR anyway but this is gonna feel like a huge leap lol that island UI was so slick
Still using a lighting connector No go for me
This is the first time ever Im actually considering the Pro Ive always preferred lighter phones but goddamn this new 14 Pro has too much to offer I might have to accept owning a heavier phone
"Im so torn on this If it had USBC it would be an instant upgrade That dynamic island is what the notch should have been all along and I really dig it The 48MP camera is I dont know Cramming that many pixels onto a small sensor can lead to a lot of digital noise But I would think that the software is sophisticated enough to reduce it pretty well The always on display is not something I want but its cool that it can do it The rest of it is pretty much par for the course for a new phone Slightly faster slightly different battery life slightly different dimensions and button locations but not a complete redesign

But my SE 2020 is struggling to keep a charge Ill probably see how iOS 16 works out first before I decide"
"Yikes at that price increase in the UK I really wanted to get the 14PM but I guess Im gonna wait another year to upgrade from my perfectly functioning OnePlus 5T I thought storage increase would compensate but knowing it still starts at 128 Might as well wait and get that USBC  pray for a price adjustment

Im really disappointed"
Honestly great Addons but the price skyrocket in Poland even if US price hasnt changed so sadly a pass for me
Love it Get ready for all the pinhole Androids to bring their notches back
Here is the link to the Apple announcement linkhttpswwwapplecomnewsroom202209appledebutsiphone14proandiphone14promax
How is the dynamic any different than androids existing notification bar
should i be worried to replace my garmin inreach mini2 for SOS capabilities
"It seems that they discontinued 13 pro since its better than regular 14 on most areas At least in Apples site you cannot buy it anymore but with sidebyside comparison 13 pro looks better deal Also in my country nonapple resellers have old stock of 13 pro 1079 while 14 regular will be 1039

httpswwwapplecomiphonecomparemodelListiphone14proiphone14iphone13pro"
Everything excellent but no USBC It seems like its coming next year so Im gonna skip this one
I heard the iPhone 20 comes with a charger
Ive been saving up money every month to get the 14 Pro since my 11 isnt working so well anymore but theyve put the price up in the UK by 150 over the 13 Pro What the fuck I cant even get the 13 Pro since theyve discontinued it
Upgrading from a 6S Cant wait
YumCadbury purple 
Goodbye money All I got from the wife was PURPLE NEED dis
usb c or nah
I already have a purple iPhonea 12 mini and its perfect
so iphone 11 is vintage now
Very nice integration btw the hardware and the software 
Cool anyway
What about when you rotate the phone though
Oh neat Beach Bunnys in this article Love that band
Insanely underwhelming on all fronts
"No mention of  WiFi 6E or Bluetooth 52

Also I wonder how this Dynamic Island will behave on a pure black background"
And no wifi 6e Amazing
Does the 14 pro max feature fast charging
Okay but can we take close up macrolike shots again or is that still not on the table 
Aww crap I work at a phone company This is going to be a busy week
This looks very nice I just believe it could work with the existing notch too
I cannot wait to take 8K photos on my fucking phone
Anyone know if UK version gets millimeter wave
As an Pixel user they definitely made good use of that pill not sure how I feel about such a large cutout but if youre going to have one this is definitely a cool way to do it
Woah so cool
Does the pill go further into the screen than the notch And what are the exact measurements of the pill vs notch
Hope videos are able to be displayed below the pill when in landscape Personally skipping this year to get a usbc iphone next year assuming it happens
Cool feature and all but why name it Dynamic island
Who would have thought notch could be used like that
Forget the island can we just get a keyboard that is easier to type text with
"Whats up with the manager situation in India I heard you guys were having problems getting hr over there to hire a certain group of people haha

Also isnt this just widgets"
"Apple first is a marketing company then a tech 
Dynamic Island Genius"
So if I have an iPhone X with a sim card and no ability to do esim How can I upgrade an move my sim info to the esim only iPhone 14
I liked how it interacts with the software looks good but for watching video content that notch just looks even bigger than before so Im not sure if this fixed anything Sure theyve embraced it but the problem is still there and actually more annoying that their old notch by the looks of it Might as well just put it in the middle of the screen
"Question for people with Cricket Wireless

x200B

Are we able to get the 14 pro with their new ESim "
Expected no USBC still Next year then 
Lightning port Hard pass
So the fact that theyre discontinuing the 13pro and 13 pro max mean that they will be worth more or less
I must have missed it but did they mention the battery life for the iPhone 14 Pro
Dropping the SIM card slot makes the US Model a no go
How is iOS going to handle full screen video with the island It seems awkward to show an island of black pixels on one side Hope they add the ability to crop the video off where the notchisland start as an interface setting at least
Ill get a pro Max or whatever it is called again but RIP iPhone mini I would be getting that if offered
Okay Ive been waiting for the 14 for the price to drop Now theyve removed the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max from their site Wtf Apple I wish I would of known
All I wanted was USBC The iPhone 14 could have been just an iPhone 13 with a 100 price hike a kick in the nuts and USBC and I would have been happy
"I knew it wasnt going to happen but its still disappointing not to see USBC 

Oh well I just got a 13 mini last year so its not time for an upgrade anyways"
Did they quietly also take out the physical cutout for the speaker Im not seeing it in any of the photos It looks like its behind the glass If they can make it work well itll give a really nice look for sure And it helps to blend the island that much better
I have an  11 Pro Max  is it worth the upgrade
I loved the island till i found out the speaker is t in it at which point what the fuck is the point of the island
After a long time I feel like they have done the very Apple thing
I really like the ideas with the island and satellite sos Also nice to see a true Camara upgrade in the standard lens But if rumors are true l Id rather wait to see the next iPhone get usbc To me that would be a real game changer Even so still a great device to upgrade too if your on an older device
Pretty sick Do wish there was green though since I am looking to upgrade this year from the 12 Pro but I will prob slide with Purple for whatever reason
The name dynamic island really sucks but its genuinely cool and looks really good in combination with the software
Ok
Screenshots are about to start looking really weird
I dont understand the purpose of dynamic island Can someone use better words
Im not upgrading until we the iPhone has a USBC port I have an iPhone 12 Pro No need to upgrade
Waiting for battery tests I love my 13pm battery and hope the 14 pro is relatively close even though I dont think it will be which is a reason I could switch but my phone is in pristine condition even caseless
iPhone 131
"That thing literally wowed me

But new phone aside can us without new iPhone PLEASE have smaller less intrusive notifications like with Face ID and whatnot too"
The only thing I dislike about this phone is how rounded the corners are
Fuck this man I am dumping my new 13 for purple
this is revolutionary
Whats it do while in landscape mode
Im just happy to see them finally make another Black phonehttpspbstwimgcommediaFcFEMaoaIAAzuJformatjpgnamesmall instead of Graphite or Space Gray like so many of the recent Pros have been
Too far Return to Moto Razr
When will the review embargo lift
Is it worth upgrading to 14 pro from 13 pro 
waiting for the 15 yawn
So I guess iphone 13 Pro users wont get this Dynamic UI 
We think youll love it
They made a base model more expensive than my car
wish that they have pro in green color
Who cares Just gonna get put in a case anyway
Im excited Cant wait to trade in my old phone
Gotta get the best out of a bad situation underdisplay technology isnt mature yet so the notch has to stay for a while yet Might as well integrate that black hole in the display into a unified UI experience
But will it have a holograph projection of Siri that can simulate sucking my dick
"I thought Id like the island but after watching the demo it seems more distracting than the notch 

I think because the notch blends in with the bezel but the island has screen all around it while playing a video 

Hopefully one day they can put everything under the screen without sacrificing image quality"
"This is what happens when Apple outApples themselves

I find this implementation somewhat genious"
"Ive still got my iPhone 6s Plus What would have tempted me to buy the new iPhone is if USBC port replaced the lightening port similar to the iPad 

Ill wait longer for the iPhone 15 hopefully that may have the USBC port included  Not many new features between the iPhone 13 and 14 after reading about the new phone"
Apple making us want something everyone collectively hated for years touch
Any new features or just a new camera and screen
I want to hate the dynamic island and I rolled my eyes at the name but watching videos of the animations for notifications has me really liking it lol Looks clean as hell
"Ohhhh I thought dynamic island was a color


Like introducing dynamic island and purple"
Me with a notchless phone because of popup selfie camera I dont get it
"What is the next innovation leap in mobile hardware I wonder that every time a new iPhone comes out Apple continues to do incredible things with the software experience it just keeps getting better and better But as far as the device hardware that is produced these dayswe seem way past diminishing returns for hardware advancement as a factor of cost Camera improvements still happen but the average consumer cant tell the difference between the speaker camera glass weight etc of the last few iPhone models So whats next Have we reached max capability of mobile hardware Do we even need phones to do anything else they dont already do The only thing I can think of is like image projection like holograms and images but it seems like batteries would have to break barriers to allow for that and Im not sure how valuable it would be 

What is the next smartphone hardware revolution or is one even necessary"
My wife and me are still iPhone 6 Our next upgrade whenever that happens will be wild
Anyone wanna talk bout EU prices Promax is 1499 eur vs 1099 usd
I am blind so the visual aspect doesnt necessarily apply to me but would someone be able to describe in detail what the dynamic island actually looks like Im very curious
Anybody else agree apple should remove black gold and silver to add more cool colors like the dark and light purple this year Like if 90 of people probably use a non clear caselet everyone that wants a color with a clear case have more options Also Id love to see everyone that always gets a black iPhone be triggered by itbe so funny
dynamic island is to iOS as the menu bar is to macOS and I am more than excited to see what 3rd party developers can utilize it for
"So the big selling point is just blacking out part of the screen to use it for notifications like android has had for years Along with marketing the always on display like its something new

x200B

I just do not understand why people think this is some kind of amazing invention"
iPhone 14 is not even an iPhone 13 Ita a nothingburger the 14 pro dynamic island is pretty slick tho ngl
iLand
its a touch bar
Lets be honest  this dynamic island doesnt add anymore usable screen space but is nicer to look at than the notch
Tim Yawn Cook
Big yikes
Apple applying The Obstacle is the Way philosophy pretty hard here with the Dynamic Island Bravo
Pen island comes to mind
I still dont understand what the dynamic island is
So if preordered Friday they will ship 916
I didnt like it 
K
iUP preapproval is live
So 13pro again
But Im in camp reduce animation is dynamic Island no longer dynamic for me
and of course no USB C 
Fuck yeah Beach Bunny getting major ad time
No USB C so I wont bother reading about the rest
Is that search bar that was show near the bottom of the Home Screen always going to be there I havent read anything mentioning it
Apple released focus not too long ago  hyped how it will help us focus on the task at hand without distractions Now they add an always on display  dynamic island that can have 2 things running at once in it Its like Apple is now saying forget focusing  now be as distracted as possible with 3 apps going on at once  Youre going to love it
The baundary of the actual punch hole becomes vague with the Dynamic Island Regardless if it is very useful in practical uses I want to generate such a clever idea
"Am I the only one still getting more and more frustrated that the bezel doesnt seem to be getting any smaller I want it gone I want that screen going all the way to the silver edge Why do they still need the bezel at all

They said during the presentation that the new phones have thinner borders Do they It doesnt look any noticeably smaller to me than previous models"
Purple should be fairly popular I dont think the gold will be a big seller Silver will do well as always but I dont think there has been an actual black iPhone since back in the single digits Im excited for that
Im probably in the minority here but I dislike it Id rather the notch be attracted to the top bezel The gap between the top just seems weird to me just like with Galaxy phones
"What is the difference between this and the 13 outside of the cutout and the camera I dont really care about cameras

Serious question"
I dont know what a dynamic island is
dee plane dee plane fantasy island
"Will you still have the option to pinch the screen in to avoid the black line

Edit while watching movies etc"
Why are the colors so girly Silver is white gold is very light and Purple Same goes for Apple Watch
anyone know if we will need a special sports app downloaded in able to have a certain game with the score up on the dynamic island
Nice  waiting on the basic iPad with type c now
so the innovation this year is rename Notch to Dynamic Island
Island gimmickry 
trashcan
So is there no iPhone Mini this time around I wanted to get one as a work phonebackup
De plane de plane
Apple can take the world beyond our imagination
   Wait what is dynamite island The name of the color
Good i can finally get a 13pro max for cheap
"And just like that  SIM cards are dead 

The way they said it too We removed it so you dont have to worry about it anymore 

What"
USBC
Is there any plausible reason they didnt name the 14 plus max  or the 14 pro max pro plus instead Apple continues with its convoluted naming schemes
Huh the notch is not only here to stay forever now but its a selling point Im not really complaining kind of the opposite actually but I definitely didnt expect that
And no USBC
Just like how silent UI is now part of the island they should take the volume UI and put it part of island as well
Will it be worth it to upgrade from an XR
1400 Canadian for the smaller model Good bye my only kidney
No usb c no party
I didnt like the purple color at all Wish they had kept the Sierra Blue
Cant wait to buy the iPhone 1617 with USBC and 120Hz OLED display in the non pro version
i am a HUGE apple lover but i dont get the hype the dynamic island isnt really doing anything new right just showing notifications i mean everyone is hyped so im happy as an apple stan but i just dont get it
Looks like Dynamic Island took up all of the design resource Its incredibly well thought out No wonder Stage Manager and Settings app on MacOS is halfbaked
It aint that cool at all Just a mini swipe up menunotification widget With the standard iPhone refining  better camera a new color new chip etc But this is coming from a nontechApple geek so what do I know
Well since none of the top comments have any real differing opinion Im just gonna say after watching its reveal and main new features its nothing to scoff at outside the its got a better camera than the last one stuff I mean isnt that expected Theyre not gonna release a new phone and go well its same camera as the one before it
Lemme guess its the best iPhone yet 
Man Purple or Gold Never had the gold before but that purple Damn
Sure did want a purple 13 but had to go with green
So instead of getting rid of the notch apple made it bigger 
"How much faster is the chip  Seems like the innovation was around things that are niche except for the camera  Ill never use the satellite SOS or temperature  Though I think they should alert you when running a fever  The cameras are better but otherwise nothing new for me

What Im really wanting is hardware innovation  Front and back screens with eink message notifications to improve battery life touchless gestures built in radar including 3d imaging satellite phones that use Starlink mobile gaming support buttons on the back of the phone to use it as controller etc"
Excited for everyone to forget that phones have had small camera cutouts for years and pretend that Apple invented it
so i am guessing the screen protector doesnt change with the animations lol
I am assuming you can tap the island to go to that activity  Would be a waste if its just a visual aid
Calling it Culo would have been fancier
Unpopular opinion Dynamic island is the new touchbar or force touch I admit I dont know if apps will have to make special code to take advantage of it but history says if so itll be dead soon
Does anyone know if they will be on display to look at in the Apple Store tomorrow or will they not be on display until Friday

So no island on the nonPro iPhone
The guy or team that came up with the software integration idea deserves a promotion if it didnt happen already
Looks the same
Google pixel did the dynamic island years ago
Is the black the same color as the 12 pro 
Looking forward to the Pixel 7 having an ad making fun of purple and the Pixel 8 being offered exclusively in purple
No mini 
So brave
Calling it Dynamic Island was a choice
"They mentioned that the 14 plus will have the longest battery life of any iPhone Im wondering what the battery life of the 14 pro and 14 pro max will be in reality then  The pro max always had the longest battery before 

I do think that the 14 plus will be a bestseller"
I wonder if previous models with the notch will get a software update to incorporate some of these features Probably not now that I think about it
Purplewell fuck me running  I guess I gotta use my upgrade soon   I fucking love love purple  Why did they do this
I wish they would come out with a metallic green metallic blue and metallic orange colors  Id get a metallic green or Alien Green one
To
Im not impressed sorry
Its already so bright and they increased the brightness lmao
I was betting for a Plus version and they are back Im so happy
Ah so the new feature is that its purple Thats worth 1000
I want the pro but dont like a single color option Tell me Im not alone on that I live the purple on the 14 Not a fan of deep purple
does it have back touchpad so i dont have to use two hands to use my phone while at the same time blocking 40 of my fucking screen jesus psvita had this and it was on fucking 2011
What  No U2 album
Anyone else disappointed they got rid of blue this year I love my 13 in the blue
I gotta get the 14 pro
 My wallet is laughing at me
For those complaining  about EU price  EURO has lost 20 of its value vs USD since the last iPhone  Might not totally explain it but its 100 a big factor atm
I was always bothered more by a punch hole camera than a notch but this makes it tolerable
Impress me by adding a charger box
The notch still looks awful
The Dynamic Island is just a useless gimmick if were honest with ourselves Theres no reason they cant also do this on an iphone with a notch the only difference would be that the popup box reaches the top of the screen If this is their best attempt at getting me to spend 1470 its not a very good one
Apple is overpriced
Why even have the island at all
"To bad they overpriced in Sweden 
Its just ridiculous"
Still thats a huge ugly cutout
"Time to unnecessarilly replace your perfectly good handset because theyve added fuck all to the next model

At this point every smartphone is identical

Theyre are essentially those pens with a clock a torch a measuring tape  just adding crap to make you buy it"
Apple Where a color is an argument for an upgrade
So basically iphone 14  iphone 13
PURPLE COLOUR OPTION
The dynamic island is the Touch Bars teams attempt to keep their jobs at Apple
700 upgrade from iphone 13 pro for some cool dynamic island lmao no thanks
Looks fucking same lad
"USBC speeds even if there is an updated more powerful Lightning Under the Display front sensors that DO NOT impede on the Display

"So many in awe about the notch island 
What about the new camera 
It seemed that Apple hardly did any significant improvement in comparaison to 13 pro 
No Touch ID no usb c or improved lightning no significant improvement in battery or processor architecture 
Some features are only available on iPhone 14 and 14 pro but on paper it seems that iPhone 13  pro and pro Mac could easily support them as well 

For people who earn enough money to not care enough about the cost it seems that upgrading shake their financial boat 
But for the ones who upgrade every 3 years or som and the price tag is heavy on their wallet its quite disappointing to see such a minor upgrade that will probably over shadowed by the next iPhone because Apple tends to do more significant upgrades every 3 years"

damn if apple shipped with broken glass some fanbois would call it a feature
Cant wait for Apollo to make use of the dynamic island on launch day
Its been how many years and Spotify still hasnt implemented HomePod support
I feel like music will just be automatic since it could pull from the now playing screen no
No no announce they will and then go quiet
Im low key nervous about implementation especially with how some apps currently dont play nice with the media center except now the dynamic island is for more than just media Theres something funky about how the media center prioritizes apps for example Overcast seems to be able to override everything for some reason I really hope there arent similar issues with dynamic island
Right third party apps need to make use of it quick before it goes the way of the Touch Bar possibly depending on how many years this Dynamic Island is here to stay
As an app developer I can tell you that the biggest thing holding us back is users on older phones Sure we can go big on every new thing but when only 10 of users are going to benefit anyway its hard to justify vs spending time on core features that everyone will get Some will implement this early in some cool way to get attention  thats a smart move for a small and growing app But I wouldnt judge Spotify too harshly for not adopting all the whiz bang stuff quickly Theres better stuff to blame them for D
Then complains about the insufficient APIs
"Is there a reason why someone would use Spotify over Apple Music on an Apple device

Honest question I swear Im in the mood for something irrationally expensive and thinking about buying the 14 Pro"
Classic spotify
Already have the phone Spotify is also already using it Lmao ragedlikemilk
wait you use spotify on an apple device instead of apple music lmfao
It is on their list right after the lossless tier
Theres no APIs for Dynamic Island so far So yeah itll be at least a year lol since its not part of iOS 16 for app devs
Theres like 10 apps I use every day that dont even handle dark mode yet

Forget the name The feature around it is so fucking cool
"God that name is awful

Great UI implementation though Its cool how they really embraced the notch rather than try to hide it Especially since under display cameras arent quite there yet"
What the hell is going in with the name of this lol its terrible
Im wondering if and how I should sell my 13PM for the 14 just because of dynamic island
And so gimmicky Im keeping my 13 Pro with its Static Peninsula I had hopes the zoom lens would improve w the main That was the only thing that would entice me to upgrade
Starring Matt Daemon and Milla Jojovic
Epstein Island 
Next year Apple will ditch this for a under display camera That would be funny
this is the tale of iPhone 14
Can they make it backwards compatible so my iPhone 13 pro can also be this cool lol
And guess what I dont care one bit Apple upgrades one thing per year and its usually irrelevant
It took me awhile to even figure out what the feature was
has to be greatest name evah for a notch I think the guygal who came up with it would be promoted for sure

Banish all UX designers to the Dynamic Island 
Im new to iPhone from android and one of the things I have issues with is using the phone one handed And now this dynamic island seems like itd be even harder to control things with one hand Just wish theyd come up with better gestures instead of finding new ways to make a notch or cutout look good or useful They never will look good and should have just left it as is until under display tech was good enough and do it better than anyone else
the Apple crack team are getting out of hands

"I really like the functionality they added with the notifications around it and stuff but I still think I prefer the 13 pro notch because its actually more tucked away into the top whereas the dynamic island is just floating in front of your content on the screen 

Maybe Id get used to it but I dont mind the slightly bigger notch because its connected to the bezel"
You got to give them nobody polishes a turd like apple does
Photonic Engine is Dynamic Islands debut album
"Dynamic island

Didnt even watch the live stream guessing this is talking about the notch"
I hate that show Oh thinking of Love Island
Its sad that others didnt do anything with the notch Whole industry of UX designers not doing anything and just wait for Apple
Out there with Stage Manager for naming schemes
It does look cool but its basically just a smart way for them to bandaid over the fact that theres a dark spot in the middle of your screen They make it seem like the dark spot is supposed to be there and does stuff when its really just a black background surrounding the notch
Sounds like the marketing team were on MDMA at the time
I think it was a super smart move Theyre stuck with the bigass cutout until we figure out how to get the camera and sensors under the display without sacrificing quality So instead of trying to make you ignore it they turned it into a fun UI element that honestly looks really cool even if its not all that revolutionary in its usefulness
Yep Here I thought this pill was going to be dumb and pointless but I am completely blown away by what they did with it on the software side Very cool
"Idk I think their crowning achievement is still Pro Max 
"
Watch closely nothing is ever displayed in the black region they just add more black region around it then display stuff there
"It is the most marketeer way of saying fuck it the notch stays

Saw it and laughed outloud Only Apple can take the notch I have on my 12 move the notifications around it black out the backgrounds and pretend its all part of the plan

Kudos to them Fantasy Island is going to make me laugh until the finally get rid of the notch"
Hoping they port it to the 13 and other models but seeing how similar the 14 looks to the 13 Im pretty sure they will use it as distinction sign lol
Its a hilarious name but Im so excited about it It might end up sucking but Im sick of the goddamn notch and Im glad Apple are finally moving beyond that and making something new and innovative and potentially less ugly
Everyone will be copying it soon I bet
Honestly thats what blew my mind All the spec upgrades were to be expected but that UX around the Dynamic Island was eye opening
So its just a fancy name for the notch that they now have made into a feature
it seems to me like a glorified notification bar
Only 999 of all your information is given to China What a deal
"Enjoy fingerprints on your front camera every time you go and use it and a huge fucking bar blocking out part of the videos youre watching

rcrappydesign"
Meh A lot of people buy thinking its a new feature But its just Apples way of trying to hide the notch They know you all will buy it
Notifications are different now  YOU MUST UPGRADE
But will make iphone even more harder to use onehended ios navigation needs a deep redesign these days android phones have much better design and are more comfortable to use sadly
hoping that it will solve the low battery notification by making it smaller and not interupt the content
Yeah I was totally whatever about the pill coutout prior to seeing the keynote but damn did they find a creative way to own it and make it a cute part of the UI
They did a good job turning the pill design into a feature Unfortunately it will probably be phased out once the cameras and sensors are hidden behind the display on later iPhone versions
I look forward both to using it and also to never calling it by that name again  Honest to god might be the worst naming Apple has ever come up with  Glad its not something I wont have to refer to often
I genuinely dont understand why people find the name funny It seems like its just a pretty straightforward description of what it does
Reminds me of the Touch Bar really  but might actually be useful since it resized
Im vacationing there later this year

Purple sounds like it should turn pink when you relax your grip
"At least in their mockups
Lets see how many bugs and limited use it gets outside of the prebuilt scenarios"
Its also a pretty literal expression of Apples famous hardware and software integration if you think about it
Not just the name but this feature is so Appleish
"imo it is second most apple name 
The first place goes to walled garden"
it will be gone like in 2 year just like touch bar and butteryfly keyboard
Am I the only one whos not impressed It strikes me as a weird bespoke UI for statuses and notifications probably meant to distract from the fact that their notch design is years behind other phone brands
"Apple app mentions 1 hour increase 

Not sure if it AOD enabled or not"
How long was it
Im so bummed no blue or green Still gonna get the phone but gonna have to think about the color
I really love the deep purple not an upgrade year for me though 12 works fine and waiting for usbc but I unfortunately doubt the purple will stick around for the 15
If they release the green later on Ill get that otherwise Im sitting this one out
Yeah disappointed that the regular 14 has more color options than the pro
Im planning on upgrading next year and I really hope they keep the purple in the line up for the 15 too Im still bitter about upgrading to the 12 and then having a purple model come out a couple of months later Just let me have a purple phone please 
Love purple generally but this execution leaves me sad With no blue or green I might have to get it as I like to do stand out colors But I wont be happy about it lol Nor if they slide green back in 6 mo from now
I just wanna know how purple it is Seems like its like the green where its pretty subdued in most lighting situations I wanna get it but might go back to gold
I was gonna get black but the more I looked at itman that purple is calling My wife convinced me to get the color
Also extremely disappointed in no pro blue 
Frankly the lack of blue is probably saving me money Love everything about the phone and could have really been tempted with a blue lol
Theyll bring it back in Q2Q3 2023 when sales of the 14 have slumped and they want one last boost before they announce the iPhone 15
I need that green 14 pro ungghhhhh
Yeah its nice but purple is less of a genderneutral color than blue and green or even yellow and orange kind of disappointing
I have the blue and honestly its not as vivid as it could be almost more greyish in some lights Im excited about the purple
Really want a Product Red Pro The watch got it The standard phone got it But not the pro
Any reason why the silver and gold are brought back every year I highly doubt they get more sales than the new colour model
Same As stupid as it sounds I might have gotten the new 14 Pro in blue to upgrade my 12 Pro but ill probably wait til next year now haha
if anything like last year they can bring a new color in 6 months apparently because sales tends to die out around that time so they need a kickstart
Theyre probably saving the colour for a midyear release again
I loved the 12 Pro Pacific Blue my favorite Pro iPhone color
Wish it has slightly darker shade of blue mixed in ala Sony Xperia purple
Im so bummed they arent I loved the green and wish I did the blue for my 13 Pro So I was really hopeful to get a blue 14 Pro Oh well
I would love a ceramic white
Im betting someone on Amazon will make a dickie type outline thing that will go near where it slightly peeks out of your case even if you have a white or black phone because whats the point of it coming in 5 colors if you always have it in a solid case you cant see through
they delayed the green colour so they might have additional colours after launch
Rose gold was the best
I was expecting a Bronze What a heartbreak
They will probably bring back blue in 6 months
They seem to take a year off of Colors so Im sure they will be back
I wish it was a little more purple Im torn between this and the black I always go for the dark neutrals bc I like to switch out cases a ton but my favorite color is purple so I might be convinced Just not sure if I like the deep purple enough from the hands on videos Ive seen you almost cant even tell its purple 
I dont understand why tech is so pastel lately I want a vivid color damn it
The purple is too dark imo
Theyll debut a new dark green again later on like Alpine Green Seems to have been really popular
Isnt there like a 90 chance that another color will get added in a couple months
So excited for the purple
Well there has to be some way to show you have the latest
I wish theyd do a product Red Pro
I had to get the mint green 11 if I got the new one Id def go purple
Guess Ill be holding onto my green 13 Pro Max until the 15 is released
"Its gonna keep shrinking too Because eventually theyll be able to put more sensors behind the screen and then finally the camera 

But the direction theyve gone is good either way The notifications have been stupidly large for too long When most will fit in a little bubble at the top regardless of the hardware dead island Ill be happy"
Thats kind of the genius of it though They took what was nothing but an obstruction before and turned it into a feature
"Honestly its kind of their thing

Apple and were calling it iPad

Consumers HAHAHAHA STUPID BIG IPHONE female hygiene joke

Yea Cause I hate notch and this is less notch
Thanks for the laugh lmao
Unironically yeah Its cool

They made the notch smaller just to make it artificially body"

"2026 the island is glitching 
I swear I saw a bigger island a few minutes ago"
"Dynamic island is a pretty clever way of using notch

Good job team Apple"
Great now all phones are gonna change their ui to mimic this piece of shit
"Its because of the implementation  The notch was embracing the intrusion by saying fuggit lets just make it inyourface intrusive and reality distort that its a good thing The dynamic island is a completely different kind of turning a weakness into a strength hiding the unavoidable black gap in genuinely useful UI features so its simultaneously always there and always hidden Thats incredibly clever design It still bugs the hell out of me when they show fullscreen video playing 

Though the dynamic aspect is on another level I think this is really closer to my preference for how they should have handled the notch Displaying the battery and bars info to the sides of it on a black background so it looks like those details are above the screen I still think that might be preferable to the island extending further into the screen than the notch did in at least some contexts"
Still dont quite get whats wrong with a flat top bezel that they gone through all the trouble with the notch and now this
Almost like things can change with time 
You cant convince me that it isnt a massive improvement in terms of looks I refused to upgrade my 8 Plus until now because the notch is so damn ugly This is so much better
Seriously Im as much of an apple dork as anybody but this is literally just a part of the screen that doesnt work
I cant wait to see what you do with it
Tell me youre getting a purple Pro for that purple name
It took me a bit to figure out why your name is purple Because you made the app Im using
Haha your name is purple
Why is your name purple
Second time seeing you in the wild I love Apollo
Thats what struck me how have they kept it secret from us for so long iOS 161 developer beta maybe
It will be interesting to see what you do with it
The only reason I still open Reddit is because of your app Thanks for making it
Make it drip
Lets goooo some sick Apollo widget
Its gonna end up as DickButt Island isnt it
Good stuff Looking forward to your work Ill be seeing you soon
"Thats such a you reply haha Thanks for all your hard work


Edit To the downvoters Im literally replying to Christian the developer of Apollo Super awesome dude and makes one of the best apps on the planet"
Might want to finish the iPad app before you start a new project Christian
I was wondering today how much time you have to develop for these new features like dynamic island If they give you access to apis too soon it might give away stuff before launch But too late and it hurts developers
Isnt it just going to be a screen with an unusable part What is exciting for developers about it
You have it operational on release date
Same
Can I get a purple name too Cyan is nice too
I just wanna know you finalized your Pro Display setup
Yoooo hi
I need you to update it with a live odometer of how far Ive scrolled in the app 
upvote arrow notification if a post is blowing up
Ayy there you are
Maybe a rolling counter for the number of miles scrolled in Apollo 
Id love to just find the developer APIs for it I couldnt find anything in the docs so Im assuming its not been released yet
You mean when they release them with iOS 17 p
thank you so so much for your app its so handy with billion of features share post as jpeg select text sort by X by time and so smooth Have paid for premium and my most used app 
cant wait to see this implemented to Apollo
Have those APIs already been released
The integration around that space looks so fucking sleek Way better than I anticipated
This is one of the first new iPhones Ive been wowed about So freaking slick
Pretty much a stroke of genius from Apple TBH  Functional and it really gives the phone some personality
"Man is everyone gonna rip this off immediately

Pill cutouts have been around for years but no one has thought about creating UI around it Samsung is going the completely opposite direction with trying to mask the cutout Watch how hard they 180 that shit 

This is honestly super slick and exciting"
Yeah watching the 14 presentation I was thinking that maybe this wasnt the year to upgrade my X but the 14 Pro looks pretty good
"Love what theyre doing with it

But the tradeoff for me is now theyre bringing attention to it Whereas I barely even notice the notch on my 13 Pro unless zooming a video which I never do"
Yeah Im keeping my 13 Pro for at least 2 more years but the way they leaned into the new notch with notifications looks great Makes it feel like more of a feature than an eyesore
Dynamic island  I like it a lot
"Im really annoyed with myself for buying a 13 Pro a couple of months back because Id happily skip what would likely just be an iterative upgrade 14

That dynamic island  and all its uses and animation are really really cool"
Im curious what notifications will look like when they come in
I really want to upgrade but its just a new way to look at notifications  Unnecessary and sexy
I agree
I really like it Gonna dynamic the hell outta that island
Psst its called the dynamic island Look it up xD
Honestly said wow a few times that is actually a feature I would buy the new phone for
And yet the software wont work with the notch
"	new notch 

its Dynamic Island are you stupid or are you deafhttpsmyoutubecomwatchvBqpUb5M3OyYt46s"
Is it only for iPhone 14 the software around the notch
you get that it just makes the black hole bigger right
"Very clever
Especially for music and calls"
Made even better by all the Redditors who complained about the wasted screen space in comments on the leaks
Way better than expected
Clever use of space but in the inconvenient spot for user interaction
By turning the notchisland into a feature they have slowed if not removed the need for them to get rid of it at least for the next few years Yes its a good feature to make use of the area but fundamentally its a way for Apple to cut the costs by not innovating and putting the camera underneath the screen Seemingly great feature but honestly just a moneysaver
Yeah Im terms of solving a problem that didnt exist in the first place Would prefer a slightly thicker bezel instead
Am I missing something This is a serious question The actual island will remain completely black So how is this any different from having information either side of the notch in the previous iPhone I saw that the animations pop out from the island but surely this is how it will have to work on the iPhone 13 I honestly dont get it
Clever girl
I love it Im just not sure about putting the music controls there playpause etc
It would be cool if there was a way to make the hole a screen when youre not using the camera and then go transparent when you want to take a picture
Im like confused how this happened
You want the animations if there were an option to have no pill floating there all the time and the animations came out of nowhere youd probably prefer that option
Yes they did Shocked
I want a notch on the bottom of the device slightly larger than the one that is there now and accepts USBC
I mean they could achieve the exact same effect with nothing there just make it completely disappear when nothing is in use  I hope this doesnt lead to them intentionally avoiding removing it completely in the future
We think youre going to love it
Makes me wonder how they may do something similar on macs with notches
No
They just reverse unod everyone Amazing
please stop calling it a notch it is not a notch the top of screen is level and doesnt dip at all
I hope fluid design like this is more present in next years iOS 17 after this
My main concern is that the pill will be more obvious than then notch with daily use Because there are pixels above it its a more obvious blacked out part of the screen compared to the notch
Whoever managed to get management to approve it you mean
I no longer allow Reddit to profit from my content  Mass exodus 2023  mass edited with httpsredactdev
Didnt this just copy and embellish every Android app that adds notification or battery rings around the camera hole Ultimately its just shaped notifications and theyve finally decided to own the thing the notch they were previously self conscious about
Yeah but you know 3rd parties and ads will be fighting for real estate of your dynamic island now isntead of your notification bar
It was me
"I dont understand what dynamic island is Everyone in the comments is so hype for it and Im over here scratching my head is this what its like too age 

EDIT okay I googled it the article just didnt describe it very well to me lol"

Its alright
I saw the Call and I thought heeeeell yes I am not freaking forced to go on the fackin call anymore just a small icon better island like it should be well done apple
Yeah I was pretty impressed with how they implemented the notifications Never occurred to me you could make  the UI zoom out while including the gap Smart
10 years ago we have full screen volume UI now we have this Truly an innovation
"Whimsical Apple was the best Apple The Jony Ive iOS 7 was pretty but it didnt seem to have the same soul as before

"I also love The Look

Dynamic Island was definitely the star of the show this year 
It would be better to have a 100 software based dynamic island so it vanish completely But probably the tech behind it wont work well below glass yet
its not a big pill its a Willow Pill
Its not really interactive so to speak its just utilizing the oled screen to make it look more interesting than the current notifications The most impressive thing here is how smooth the animations are Youll still interact with the screen portion on the sides maybe the dead center between camera and sensor alas swiping down from the wifibattery indicator thats currently offered
You do realise that the island is just an empty space so how can it be interactive
Its not though
The island is the main reason I will switch from my 11 Pro Thats the kind of new stuff I was hoping for
I actually didnt like that they compared it to the competition or the chip from two years ago It really didnt give insight to how much its improved over last years
"I just dont give a shit about HDR brightness When they said when watching your favorite HDR movies I got kinda disgusted at the thought of watching fulllength HDR movies on a 6 screen

SDR sustained brightness is the real metric that matters Peak HDR brightness is such a niche spec that people dont use 999 of the time"
USB 20 Lightning speed is also insane
Peak brightness Sustained brightness will actually burn your house down The former is much less impressive
Aye Im a year older on phone than you so the island sold me completely on it Looking forward to picking one up later this year
Im also sold and Ill be upgrading from a XS so this will be insane
I was watching the keynote with a friend of mine and told him had no need for a new phone just yet just as the Iphone 14 reveal came on 10 min later they convinced me I needed a new phone by the Dynamic Island presentation alone That shit was so cool
Yeah if I didnt have 13 Pro Max I would consider an upgrade Still worried about esim only though
"2000 nits of brightness is insane

Very useful outdoors I do wonder if the thermal management is better particularly when used outdoors such that no dimming would happen often"
Will any sort of dynamic island is available for iPhone 13 pro max by any chance
Same still keeping mines as well Not really a big difference besides the notch thing and Samsung disappointed me this year hoping something better comes out next year
Even a week ago the leak wasnt that detailed either It was just youll be able to hit the lights to see what app was using your microphonecamera lol They truly did well with hiding their secrets this year
I never believed that they would introduce something that is not symmetric Probably that rumor was based on the hardware design of the sensors
The leakers are all supply chain getting info out of Foxconn and component suppliers You can get the raw hardware design out of those sources but only Apple employees know how the hardware interacts with the software
They were correct on the hardware its the software portion they didnt know about which makes sense
Or maybe apple found a way to troll those leakers
To be fair they did have the pill leak like almost a year ago And even more impressive was the satellite feature being a rumor from last year that didnt show up Its funny that ultimately Huawei confirmed yesterday cause they live for copying apple
I think the leakers are mostly aware of hardware stuff and not the software
"So the leakers really had no idea what was going on with the pillhole punch thing did they up until about a week ago

I assume their sources only saw the hardware and knew nothing about what the software could do haha"
I mean the leakers werent wrong it DOES have a screen cutouts that are always there
Its because they have info from manufacturers and this is a software feature Engineers in China probably had very little info about that
Weirdly something almost exactly like this was rumored to replace the home button on the iPhone X
I really hope this gets talked more The leakers were had They proudly leaked about a single dot for privacy elements as a UI element in the pill And here we have a full system around it They need to be called out
First time
Reminds me of the iPhone X when people thought Apple would put a Touch Bar at the bottom where the home button used to be
Itll stick around for 45 years kinda like the notch before it
Same as a ux designer i was wowed
All this years Nobody else did that until now
Now realize how many elements to use are at the most top of the phone and how uncomfortable it will be to use onehanded
They also added hardware antialiasing for visible borders as they added for the rounded borders of the macbook
The gesture navigation they introduced with the iPhone X was even more revolutionary It seems something so simple yet it took them years of research to get it right and now basically every Android phone copied it and even then its not as smooth as iOS
This visual trickery will definitely flow back to the Macs and iPads They had to give the iPad Pro a bezel because it needed to hide the faceID elements With this they never need to
Agreed cant remember the last time I was really excited about a new software  hardware integration feature
I hope they set some public APIs for this and the alwayson display it would make possible to emulate the notification led via a group of pixels in the notch area
But the notch on the iPhone X was something that was going to be phased out and they still invested in it I do think the pill will get smaller but only if the technology of under display sensors reaches Apple standards
I have the XS Max that I have kept because I feel like it was the last model with an innovative feature I am finally retiring it for the Pro
"Im a little surprised I dont see anyone mention this I feel like Im always either listening to music or watching the score on a game or taking an Uber which means the island will practically always be extra wide
I dont think itll look good if its super wide 95 of the time
Dont know what you think"
Im I the only one who finds it cheesy
"this is one of the UI design where it is seems common sense but ACTUALLY hard to idealize as a designer


A month ago people used to hate Alan Dye because of macOS redesigns but im always a fan of him after Ive Now people love him"
rHailCorporate
Why do you think that Im honestly baffled why people are wowed I dont think people are realizing the pill is still there in all those UI iterations
"I dont think its that complex The dynamic island obviously builds on the concept of live widgets  so once a developer hooks onto that API it should automatically work on the dynamic island for the most part I would hope at least If you look at the demo there was a dynamic island for Lyft and sports scores both of which are the same or similar use cases that apple demoed for iOS16 So once the developer updates their app following live widget guidelines the dynamic island will be able to pull the right info and artwork from that 

either way super cool implementation"
I imagine that it will be some time before we get decent throughscreen cameras but even longer before we get one there up to Apples standards Getting a high quality version of such a camera seems like a tall order
"If youre stuck with a compromise for a while may as well make the effort to make it the most beautiful compromise on the market 

As far as gimmicks go its innocuous enough not to be silly doesnt require freakish hardware pop out camera and just looks really fucking good 

Its one of the most Apple things that have ever Appled"
"More interestingly its on a feature that is likely to be transient go away in the medium term so its brave lol that theyre investing a bunch of engineering and design effort  and subjecting all other iOS devs to it  on a feature they eventually probably want to phase out Definitely leads me to believe that the cutout is here to stay for a while

My guess is since Touch Bar was around for about 4 years Id like to think the same for the Dynamic Island and I remember a line spoken during the iPhone X keynote about how it set the path for the next decade so 4 years later would be close to 10 years since the iPhone X was announced"
Android Developers start your copiers
Great take on it Mr Bulbasaur 
Apple implemented Touch ID while Face ID was in development meaning they knew Touch ID would be phased out yet they chose to invest in it
Im actually excited to see android oems copy it I want to see what they come up with itll be interesting
"And even when the notch is phased out the dynamic response to events and level of interaction will likely stay 

Theyve effectively said this is a step forward for the entire industry And will be far easier for them to do than for android to imo 

Rare that Ive gotten to see a phone idea and believe its a home run as soon as I see the preview"
I also believe itll stay longer than the launch cos its now a core feature of iOS
" Some more thoughts on the operational aspect of this and maybe why no OEMs on Android have implemented something similar

I think this is a BS excuse and Google shouldnt be given the grace as to why they missed this opportunity  Google should have come up with this sort of integration years ago when they started seeing phones with cutouts in the display Hell Google themselves have been using cut out displays for 2 years now and have done nothing but push content to the sides and made wallpapers to hide it 

I know not all android OEMs where making cutout style phones but enough of the high impactvisible ones were enough to the point that investing in this type of thing should have been fast tracked Sadly once again Apple comes along with a fully flesh out implementation of something the android folks should have explored and implemented early on

Im looking at my Pixel 6 Pro wondering how the hell apple came in years after cutouts first made their way onto android and so thoroughly bodied it

yes Im a little bitter"
It will be phased out sure but the notch have been around for 4 years Im sure this pill will be around for at least 3 Its slick and definitely mesmerizing in a way When a new thing comes out this will go to the non Pro models so likely will be used for another few years
It is very well done right now and we all know it is to hide the notch We may have the camera and face ID hardware for some time to come Even without the need for faceid hardware or under display camera the island can still stay there It is good design and probably will make it into existing phones one day
"Just to not blow this out of proportion theyre not really subjecting devs to it Ever since the notch the concept of a safe area layout has been abundant meaning that there likely wont be any code change necessary to support iPhone 14 pro devices outofthebox The only thing some devs will be thinking about is if this is a useable space for their product and if so what to do with it

More likely than not most apps wont be able to do too many useful things up there unless theyre providing some kind of live service eg playback features as we saw and maybe some neat things adjacent to PnP or background tasks"
" 
 
 More interestingly its on a feature that is likely to be transient go away in the medium term

I dont see why  When the notch is eventually done away with it just gives more flexibility for the dynamic island to change as needed without having to work around a physical hole in the screen Shrink it to a dot when inactive during normal operation have it disappear entirely for browsing photoswatching videosusing certain apps etc

Assuming this ends up being popular and wellliked theres no need to throw the baby out with the bathwater and I expect the dynamic island is here to stay  Its just going to get a whole lot more dynamic"
" More interestingly its on a feature that is likely to be transient go away in the medium term

I disagree For one thing I think fully transparent screen is a harder problem than youre giving credit for its going to start to bump up against physics rather than engineering

For another I think they like their status bar Even when theres no pill up there at all Id guess the top 40ish pixels are going to keep being used for this it looks like an absolutely delightful mini Lock Screen

Im honestly just amazed at how fucking good iOS devices have gotten as portable everyday computers"
"Isnt it just a view for an interactive notification Like most media playback apps have been doing it for ages  

Yeah it always wraps the pill in black but that is just design in the end"
it is considered brave to spend all the money you make versus just hoarding it up
Its not going away anytime soon Id guess at least five more years of notch And when they do phase it out theyll only phase it out for their flagship model while the cheaper options will keep it for even longer
No android has done anything like this because android devices are fragmentized and its impossible to get app devs to do special stuff for just a few phones Whereas Apple has the numbers and pull to get devs to implement the latest features
Its great But was really hoping the pros would start with 256gb 
Starting from 1400 in Denmark Big oof
Lmao if I trade in my 13 Pro Max for the 14 Pro Max I get almost the same price that youll get in the US for the 14 Pro 909
Uk 949 to 1099 lol With huge cost of living issues cant see Apple selling as much as they hope
Sadly the price went up in the UK 
UK price has gone up by 150
"Price increased from 1225 to 1395 for the 14 Pro compared to the 13 Pro here Norway

x200B

A 256GB 14 Pro Max now costs 1670 compared to 1470 for the 13 Pro Max 256GB and just 1199 in the US

x200B

So around a 200 price increase on models that were already 200300 higher than US pricing "
Its 1300 in Austria Thatd be like 30 VAT to the US price lol
1000 for a phone is really weird to get excited about Apple has trained you well
Only the USD price every other regional pricing went up lol
In Germany it got insanely expensive 1450 Euros for the base 14 Pro Max
and they kept the slow 20 USB lightning 
They kept it because the USD is strong while every other currency is tanking
Are you happy it stayed the same or upset it didnt go lower
They truly gave themselves a lot of headspace with the X pricing
Can somebody sell me on how dynamic island is useful So far all I see is sexy animation hiding all of the functionality in my notifications bar
Whats so creative about displaying information on a screen Dynamic island is the equivalent of putting googly eyes on a potato
I hope that can be disabled for people who dont want it but rather take the extra battery life
The Madmen reinvented the notch and I freaking love it The madmen freaking did it
Its not hardware and software integration its artificially coloring black and positioningsizingshaping pill the software because of a hardware flaw the notch  This is the same notification bar or system tray that every device has had for 40 years but with more ways for devs to present background notification type info which is good except now its black and pillshaped to confuse the perception of the terrible notch
In Europe prices for 12 are still the same as far as I can see I dont understand
"Same Still on the 11 Pro

And yeah I believe it showed MagSafe in the little feature board"
MagSafe should be sticking around for the foreseeable future well probably see the charging port removed before MagSafe
I have a 12 pro max and I was anticipating not really feeling any particular interest in the 14s The new screenisland is pretty clever though as is satellite I dont know if its compelling enough for me to bother switching quite yet but knowing theres some actual nice improvements if I do makes it a more compelling argument than the 13s were
"Also does this still have MagSafe

MagSafes not going anywhere Id bet well lose the cable connection port before we lose magsafe"
Yeah I was undecided as also on a 12 Pro but the 14 Pro has me sold
"x200B

I literally dont get this sub its so clear that Apple stunted this iPhone upgrade and is hoarding features for next year such as USBC for their typical 3 year upgrade cycle which people said was gone

How exactly did they make it stand out beyond the camera for an average user exactly I genuinely am baffled that people on here are so complacent with this update

The Dynamic Island is cool but is mainly driven by the need for sleek software integration to avoid being ridiculed for little hardware changes rather than revolutionary technology advancements

I dont include the dynamic island as its more of a software innovation than hardware predominantly needed due to the cutout Similar levels of usability innovation can be done to mane aspect of the iPhone

Literally 90 of upgrades in the keynote have been focused on photography and cameras since

I was so keen to upgrade my 12 this year to a 14 Pro now I will wait"
I have a 12 pro like you and I wont upgrade
Staying with 12 another one more year easy decision tbh
Im still using a XR Definitely making the leap this year to a 14 Pro
It does I saw the MagSafe icon in the rounded rectangle banner thingy for the 14 and 14 plus
There is no single reason to upgrade even from 11 series Just burning money for literally nothing
I dont think magsafe is going anywhere
"Ive got a 12 mini and I love it but I also have a 12 for work and I do miss it being bigger go figure 

The purple 14 Pro is gorgeous This is genuinely tempting me when Id initially planned to just get a battery service and go on sim only Goddamn Apple"
You dont care about the dynamic island features after 2 weeks
in italy we have 1029 for the base 1339 for the 128gb pro 1tb is 1989 and 1489 for the 128gb pro max 1tb is 2139
With the oil companies fucking us apple saw that germans will complain but wont do anything against the price increases
Base model is 1700 in Turkey because of the taxes
"Here in Brazil its even worse starts at R 10000 equivalent to 1925 minimum wage is R 1212month 233

No f way i will ever get one"
In Romania its also the equivalent of 1300 eur for the 14 Pro Im dreading the day when I will have to upgrade my XS as I dont trust second hand sellers or the online random people selling sealed iphones aka Chinese fakes so I will have to buy new again
"9to5maccom20220

Same Its literally my favorite color I cant wait to get my hands on it"
Ok but the question is how dim does it get I hate using my phone in the dark because its so bright
Its not locked for HDR video is it I hate that they did that on the iPad Outdoor visibility is way more important
The island is brilliant though It takes an area that was supposed to be ignored and seamlessly integrates information when needed
Do people max out their screen brightness Mine is usually set at 50 or below I just experimented at 100 and I feel like doubling that will punish my eyes
So like that must drain your battery like crazy right 2000 nits using your phone outside for an hour must torch your battery
Yeah Samsung is incredible at making phone screens
The island isnt stupid at all That is peak design engineering and blending of hardware and software
1499 here for the pro max what the hell
European prices are fucked up
Can buy a whole gaming rig for that much
What did you expect with the current exchange rates
whered you get that info Im tryna find the UK price
Yeah the prices here in portugal are also ridiculous 1350 for the pro
1400 for the Pro in sweden
I was thinking the same thing Better grab one of those Apple cleaning cloths to use before taking a selfie
Peoples cameras even the rear ones are already super smudgy I can usually immediately tell if a photo was taken with a phone as theres always weird artifacts around any light sources from smudges
Maybe they added new coating for finger printswho knows
Maybe It seems like you can tap anywhere on the pill though so you could avoid the camera
Id watch that dating show Today on dynamic island
Maybe if you guys stop cooking in the afternoon you can afford it
Not exactly their fault the prices stayed the same
Hopefully it helps him stop rolling in his grave from them giving up on the mini size
"No hes not

As Jobs said with iPhone 1 the whole point of a digital display is that it can show you whatever you need in the best way Dynamic Island violates that by letting a horribly flawed hardware compromise be the guiding factor for how the GUI is styled color shape size position

This is just a notification area  System Tray  Touchbar  animated Title Bar like every device already has except now its styled to look like the hardware notch  This is kind of a momentous historical occasion where Apples presentation and marketing is 100 cut off from the tradition of Jobs  Arguably they were there already with the notch  iPhone 14 still has visible bezel edge around displayJobs would be smiling if the required hardware was out into that

The good part more deliberationSDKAPIwhatever behind how devsapps can use notificationsthats a good thing but has literally nothing to do with Dynamic island or notch as presented which was deceitful"
Its not turning a flaw into a cool feature its styling the feature to look like the flaw so that people are confused about the flaw  Which is the opposite of what GUIs and digital displays are supposed to do see Steve Jobs presentation on iPhone 1
Ya I havent seen other comments on the always on display It shows much more detail than IIRC is seen on other phones with that feature
" clever integration between hardware and software

No it isnt  Its just restricting your GUI in color black and shapesizeposition pill to confuse the issue of the horrible notchpill  See iPhone 1 presentation by Jobs the whole point of digital display is that it shows you what you need in whatever way is helpful Dynamic Island violates that by artificially limiting the GUI design just for the purpose of looking like the hardware flaw

Its like if iPhones kept getting rusty metal so they changed the wallpaper to rust color  Clever integration of hardware and software no"
"What I find strange about the alwayson implementation is that they missed the opportunity to add a lowpower alwayson mode taking advantage of the properties of the screen

OLED displays have individuallylit pixels meaning that each pixel is its own backlight Lighting a subset of the pixels on the screen would only use the power necessary to light those individual pixels

Combine that with the dynamic island no matter how many times I type it it still sounds awful and they could just light the pixels necessary for that small strip at the top expanding temporarily if necessary to display an incoming textetc and use a fraction of the power necessary to light the whole screen

Keep the alwayson whole screen as an option of course but I dont see the necessity of spending power lighting up whats mostly a static wallpaper"
Where did this price increase come from Even though the US is the same price
"15490kr here in Norway for the base Pro Max
Thats 1547 or 1548 US give or take
Kinda expensive"
1339 in Italy  for the 14 Pro 128GB
"USA 1

lol"
Given his accent English isnt probably his first language My anxiety would have probably kept me up all night too
Im surprised I had to look this far before i found someone complaining about the lack of USB type c If i bought this it would be my only device i own that isnt USB type C Im genuinely shocked they are still using the lightning cable and for me its an automatic nonstarter
Hold on one more year Youll thank yourself plus your phone is still a beast
1449 base price in Germany as wellfor fuckign 128gb
2219 US 1649900 kr for the 14 Pro Max with 1 TB of local storage if buying directly from Apple
Laughs in Canadian dollars
I thought your government provided everything you need with those high taxes  Wont they be getting you the new iPhone
The Macs are USBC   Why not keep things consistent like others
Next year is our time to shine
"Are they still capped at 20 watt charging It seems awful compared to the 100 watts a lot of other phones charge at

My phone does 120 watts and doesnt get hot I charge every other day for 510 minutes Apple are really lagging behind here"
"The company is US based so thats their home market that theyll provide pricing on

International prices are all different because it has to account for varying import taxes and costs specific to each country"
Canada is the same
AFAIK the price increase is only in Europe and UK Theres no price increase in India Singapore China etc
try being american
Nondynamic Peninsula
Static Peninsula We think youre gonna love it and so on
Wow you are so sensible and rational
Im no island peninsula maybe
Virgin peninsula vs Chad island
Mine isnt but it doesnt have a say in the matter
My kidney is ready
Hope for you youre not living in Europe Price stays the same in the US and goes up 250 in Europe Ridiculous
Still no USB C Sad Wont be getting this one unfortunately
energy bills be damned
In Italy the 256 model now costs 146900 Thats fucking insane
same for germany the 256gb version is now 1430 quite a steep price increase sadly
New iPhones are slowly becoming more a North America only accessible devices Price increases the satellite feature which they spent 10 mins banging on about is North America only
Thats one expensive sim tray
and instead of discounting the 13 pro they remove it from the store zzz
I paid 1199 for a 256GB 11 Pro The 14 Pro is 9 more expensive which is not bad considering inflation and how fucked the exchange rate is
Maybe they are offloading the cost of the SIM tray to other markets
That is just brexit The usd versions are the same as last year your currency has just devalued since last years came out
Blame your currency
I didnt think of that i wonder if itll interact with the reachability screen drag
I didnt expect to see so many Dynamic island  comments  When I first saw it I thought will this become the next MacBook Pro Touch Bar ie something that seemed interesting but not many people actually used and was eventually discontinued to much customer delight
yup its great but its gonna have many people dropping their phones
Samsung recognized this a few years ago and tried to make most of their UI elements you interact with at the bottom of the phone to make it easier to use big phones Aesthetically it doesnt look great but it fixed the problem of having limited reach with your thumb when using a phone one handed
Wonder how they are going to handle this on older iPhones with the new OS
"its a little funny how you say notifications are the ONE thing android excels at

and then in your next sentence you talk about how much you love always on displays which androids have had for ages"
" The pro model only costs 13 more

SO basically we should use Apple as inflation benchmark If we dont get paid 13 more this year we all quit"
The Euro is at an all time low against the US dollar cant really blame Apple for it it still sucks though
I feel like they rushed the iPhone pro presentation and left out lots of details
Yes
According to MKBHD only for US phones thankfully
Yes but the website states that you can have multiple phone plans on the phone So when you travel you can just add a digital local sim
Yes on US version
"People keep saying this But mark my words the 15 wont have any ports at all the removal of the sim tray was step 1 step 2 is removing the charging port and moving everything to MagSafe

This would allow a completely sealed iPhone with great water depth"
Colours look garbo
I get it but most people buy a case to cover it up I am caseless with my 13pm sierra blue and love it
This is why Ive settled on the white every time
Just weird to be sitting on those lemons since 2018
yeah insane to think a base model pro is now 1100 and maxed out its 1750
"This comment was edited in response to Reddits API changes in July 2023

On May 31 2023 Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that would kill every third party app on Reddit from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader Also under the new rules third party Reddit apps cannot run ads cannot show NSFW content and are hit with other restrictions

There are plenty of articles and posts to be found about this if you want to learn more Heres one posthttpswwwredditcomrSave3rdPartyAppscomments14b8i62redditprotestandthenextsteps with some information on the matter

This move will require developers of third party applications to pay enormous sums of money if they wish to stay functional meaning that said applications will be effectively destroyed Some third party apps may survive but only with a paid subscription In the short term this may have the appearance of increasing Reddits traffic and revenue but in the long term it will undermine the site as a whole

Even if youre not a mobile user and dont use any of those apps this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the oldredditcom desktop interface This isnt only a problem on the user level many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities ontopic and spamfree

Reddit relies on volunteer moderators to keep its platform welcoming and free of objectionable material It also relies on uncompensated contributors to populate its numerous communities with content The above decision promises to adversely impact both groups Without effective tools which Reddit has frequently promised and then failed to deliver moderators cannot combat spammers bad actors or the entities who enable either and without the freedom to choose how and where they access Reddit many contributors will simply leave Rather than hosting creativity and indepth discourse the platform will soon feature only recycled content botdriven activity and an everdwindling number of wellinformed visitors The very elements which differentiate Reddit  the foundations that draw its audience  will be eliminated reducing the site to another dead cog in the Ennui Engine

If you want a Reddit alternative check out rRedditAlternativeshttpswwwredditcomrRedditAlternatives

You created your content You didnt get paid Why would you leave it here for Reddit to make money or train AIs Take your content with you There is no Reddit without its users and volunteer moderators As they say If youre not paying for the product then you are the product

When everyone is literally starving and freezing lmao
1450 in Germany Guess the rest of the world will have to fund them keeping the same price at home And they dont even have the decency to up the base storage to 256g
Yeah the part where they showed video playback was eye popping how in they way and painful the island was on the screen I would 100x take the notch over the island for full screen video consumption
It appears much more black
Based on the marketing images it is a darker grey hue on the stainless steel band than last years Graphite but not a pure black
Jeez no 6E I guess streaming plex blu rays is still not a thing for iPhones then Not that anyone wants to watch cinematic video content with a notch er Island in the way
Its the pill that you see on the pro version Basically the software adapts to it through notifications and live activities Sorts makes the pillisland unnoticable Pretty cool and clever if u ask me
"Basically the new pillshaped notch is now integrated seamlessly into UI elements For example when you use FaceiD the pill appears to expand into a black square where the faceid icon comes up when you listen to music the pill gets a bit wider to fit album art next to it when you have a timer running the pill gets wider to show the remaining time etc 

It looked very very slick"
A name that makes a flaw sound like a feature
Instead of a notch its a bit smaller black rectangle a bit lower on the screen Apple embraced it by making the dark par grow on the sides por system notifications and other things Imagine connecting your AirPods and the dark pill grows a bit in a fluid way to show an AirPod animation Also live scores on each side of the pill lots of posibilities Very worth the watch
"The notch is disconnected from the edge of the display making it a Notch Hole Theyre using the Notch Hole to center new interface elements

As far as I can tell it doesnt do anything that we havent seen on other phones before and its all easy to do on a phone with an unbroken display It just looks like a fun way to use a notch hole"
Just wait to watch the video the animations and how fluid it all is is what really makes it awesome Describing it doesnt do it justice
Almost certainly
Should be yeah
Yea I could handle that purple too Been white the last two after always going black
"I am in Korea and the price is 125 million here900
I move to milan next year and just hope I dont lose my iphone and have to buy one over there"
Did you say the same thing last year Cuz US prices are exactly same
That would be a crazy move Cancel the normal 14 Mini but introduce a 14 Pro Mini
Yeah Id like to see some phonesized phones in the phone announcement events rather than only phablets
"Im wondering if the sales of the 14 Plus will help steer Apple in a direction where the Plus comes every 2 years and then the Mini takes its spot

Idk how many people are upgrading annually at this point and it cant be THAT hard to make a mini version every few years"
The camera is not inscreen lol
I dont know how you come up with this last statement when the competitors have been making folding phones for multiple generations now lol And dont say that they are a gimmick because if apple was the one to make them first 4 years back it would then has been labelled as the biggest innovation of the era
Its 1339 for the base iPhone 14 Pro in Italy
"If you convert dollars to pounds and add VAT which is 20 you get about 1040 

So its just a 59 markup Its pretty reasonable the pound is just worth less now than it was a year ago"
US prices dont include taxes
Does the UK price not include VAT
1300 Yeah I think Ill pass
999 means 1350 in France apparently lol
Yeah in Germany it means 1299 Its a fucking joke And no bigger base storage that one still sits at 128GB 
My 13 Pro Max was 1099
I feel like Apple doesnt need help selling everything
iPhones use lightning cables Been that way for a while
Why would you put a screen protector on ceramic shield anyway
Its basically the light bar but for phones Im confused why everyone hated the light bar but loves the island also a little salty cause I loved the light bar and its dead now
US price doesnt include taxes
Nope still 20 speeds
The reason why Apple doesnt push changes right here 
"But I dont think this takes away from your current options You currently dont have these interactive icons to interact with The few you do have for calls are currently further up the display in the far corner 

So yeah on a maxplus Youll need to readjust your hand or use two hands Possibly or reg size But thats not really a change Still easier to use that what was there before"
"I still cant get over how bad the name is Dynamic Island We get it Apple wants to position itself in a different class and not use pill or hole punch

I wouldve named it the pop Goodbye notch hello pop The pop at the top Pop pop POP  What phone you got iPhone 14 pro The one with the pop Yeah 

DYNAMIC ISLAND"
Um no The dynamic island is horrible ui design We want ui elements as close to your thumb at the bottom section of the screen Especially for larger phones Something ONE UI is designed from ground up to do Other than that love some of the new features
"Color has no gender You do you 

Im a man and will be buying the Deep Purple finish My past few phones have been Graphite 13 Pro Max Pacific Blue 12 Pro Max and Silver X Its time for a change"
"O it just occurred to me that a 48MP quad Bayer filter would have the file size of a normal 48MP image without the actual spatial resolution of one For RAW at least Gross

You can do some neat things with quad Bayer arrays but the marketing on them is rather disingenuous I suppose you could say the same thing about a normal Bayer filter though"
Pour one out for forest green
The notch in general is the touch bar equivalent This is still the notch more or less Until they use touch ID under the display I dont see the point of their strategy
"Sadly see it going the same way Its such a small space to work with even the maps and directional integration looks pretty meh Developer supportease of integration will be crucial 

Other hardware changes including the cameras display and A16 look awesome though"
At least in this case theyre adding a touch interface where one belongs Will be interesting to see if they keep some of the behavior when the pills are gone
Shhh dont interrupt the circle
These are the worst color choices in like 5 years Those greens and blues of past years were beautiful This purple is quite unremarkable Black silver are boring and gold is cheesy
Yeah these colors are so fucking boring
Its the pill
On the apple website in stores  through carriers
Id probably wait I heard the iPhone 15 is coming out next year
Unless they get rid of FaceID in favor of TouchID under the display more than likely yeah
Right Might be keeping my 12 for another year
Im thinking it does get to the normal models next year
Compared to what The prices are the same from last year
Sadly not apples fault The UK pound has been doing poorly due to many factors The price is showing after VAT and the US price is before tax
So I am not the only one that fell for the island Exact same boat as you time for an upgrade
What is the island in practical terms I didnt quite get their version
Please say hi for me as well Its been a very long time since I used a Google device
It already had the name Holepunch but apple is once again making up names for things that already exist so its like they came up with it
"Its what they call their inability to match samsungs tiny uninvasive holepunch solution to the frontfacing camera

Its not a failure now that theyve given it a sexy new name"
"Theres like a permanent black notch at the top of the screen to have a space for a camera and sensors Theyve created a permanent UI bar thats the same black and hugs around it to hide the fact its there 

It seems to be implemented well but really isnt that unique or interesting imo 

It also doesnt even completely solve the problem since the black spot is still there when watching videos etc"
Yes There is video of it
Lol This was a very clever geography joke I commend you good sir or madam
Thanos was right
Have you seen what this feature looks like in landscape when you try to watch a YouTube video Wow it looks terrible in landscape
Still has lightning I think As does the new Airpods Pro
This is why Im buying this iPhone Last generation to use lightning
How often do you actually plug a cord into your phone anyway Itd make more sense to just delete the port entirely at this point
I feel like weve had all day battery life for quite a while now lol
They use a feature called screen on time to measure battery life better
Same boat Not getting to that island this year
Or like their iPads those get a new version every 23 years They can have iPads and Mac devices one year and the next iPhones Apple Watches and maybe AirPods
YES
The real joke are the people going YES this is awesome Thanks Apple for taking things away from me
This guy next year Ill wait for the iPhone 16 instead
Most iPhone users arent upgrading yearly anymore lol so the one that are hype are the one that are due to an upgrade
Its pretty lackluster but as a person who uses a phone outside quite a bit Im hyped for the 2000 nit screen
Fck them Dont switch  Theres many ways to counter imessage if they werent just being assholes
You are making it difficult for yourself Buy whatever suits you Your family and friends arent going to carry your extra cable or get you a sim tray It isnt worth it just to switch just for iMessage
Same here
Last year the euro was over 10 more valuable compared to the dollar
The notch is too big it would be obvious that theres no touch sensitivity The pill is small enough that it will actually feel like a part of the screen that you can touch and interact with because your finger will make contact with the touch sensitive area around it
What would you say constitutes professional phone use p
11 pro user here And yes we live to fight another year 
What would be considered not a notch
"Every major US carrier offers eSIM as well as large international carriers

You can have more than one active eSIM on your iPhone Why do people think you can only have one It absolutely has zero impact on traveling and international roaming"
I assume the US prices are without taxes Unlike Europe the US has taxes per state instead of 1 tax percentage for the whole country The UK prices are including tax making the difference look higher than it actually is The US prices are always cheaper though even with taxes added
"Well 20 of the UK price is VAT 

And the us price will be before taxes 

Making it more like a 14 dollar difference  difference in taxes"
"Thats the best alternative name Ive heard yet 

Dont like the emoji your friend sent you in an iMessage Just drag it into the black hole and POOF its deleted from your phone permanently"
I agree This was the best way they could do it but they shouldnt have done it until they could get rid of the notch entirely Its interesting and yet still disappointing
No more physical sim on any of them
"Yes all new generation iPhones are eSIM only moving forward

But eSIM allows for multiple carriers to be active on a single device so not sure how that impacts your traveling"
"The US model is From the product page

iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are not compatible with physical SIM cards"
"Models are Dual SIM nanoSIM and eSIM or
Dual eSIM support"
Im surprised they still have a charge port For the iPhone 13 there were many rumors that theyd do away with the charge port
"It is honestly pretty irresponsible they are still using Lightning in todays age

They promised 10 years of Lightning support after people lost their minds when they dropped the 30 pin 

  
The 14 is that 10 years"
Not if you dont live in the US Prices are up sharply here in Europe
The camera bump is larger on the 14 Pro series so no they wont be compatible
Whats wrong with the current beta implementation
thats there in new ios update the battery precentage
Of course They always ship with the newest OS
Huh you cant just add from Spotify or through a file manager Im on a galaxy s9 so just wondering Also you cant make chrome a default browser
A 6
Lol gone by iPhone 14 ultra Max pro limited edition lol
You guys made a tiny dot instead of a notch Well well make our own phone With a LARGER notch And well call it a feature
Yea pickup in store is usually available if you order early enough Thats what I usually do and then I drop my phone off when I pick up the new one
What do you mean Cant you just ship it to your address sync your current to your new then just wipe your current and ship it off for trade in Because the new phone will be set up and your current one unusable Right Thats mg plan at least
You ship the phone in after you get your replacement
"They moved the front facing camera and sensors down from the top of the screen slightly to get a slight advantage on screen real estate compared to the notch on current iPhones Rather than leaving it as a pill visually at all times they used the software to make it a selling point The apparent size of that space is capable of changing due to OLED making blacks just turn the screen off and they use that to put information like timers song info when youre playing music and many other things at a quicker glance than iOS has done before without modifying the way time cellularWiFi connection and battery are already displayed 

Android has done similar things before but the difference here is how its pulled off Its not ground breaking but its clean"
"So if you have any iOS friends you will observe that they live like cavemen because Apple deigned it appropriate for users to control their music from Control Center not notifications as it should be at the top 

Its this action where you have to look down swipe up look right and control your music using a really dated looking UI Whereas on Android its always at the top like in Dynamic Island there is album art and dynamic colouring by default etc 

So they have implemented a modern music control panel and gave it cool animations As an Android user I think it looks cool and it is better than ours"
I think it looks cool and I use a phone with no notch or hole punch OP7P It does seem a little gimmicky but so is my popup camera
" The astroturfing in here is ridiculous

Anyone who has a different opinion than has been paid to express it obviously

Shrug"
"My assumption is that your notifications will still function as normal

Dynamic Island will populate current and live data from apps that are pertinent and critical in the moment 

For example in their marketing videos they show a live time countdown of arrival time by your Lyft driver in dynamic island Whereas you wouldnt see this information on your display normally"
Im sure some third party camera apps will use it as well
"If I had a 12 or older generation iPhone Id go for the 14 instead of the 13 just for the new Emergency Satellite SOS feature alone

The Camera upgrades are fine but sometimes Im on hiking trails where there is zero cellular service and being able to use the 14 to contact emergency services via satellite would literally be a lifesaver if I got seriously injured"
In a pill shaped cutout in the screen at the top httpstwittercomviticcistatus1567583848212430856s21tVejCOCocsNFarXEklBIow
Yes youll be able to
"Yeah itll come with a USBC to Lightning cable 

PS If you needwant more chargers Anker is a great product"
For the US market yes I agree
You may have time to return the 13
You cant be serious Have you seen what landscape looks like when you watch a YouTube video It looks horrible I doubt anyone will copy this feature Id rather have the hole punch then a black pill punch
Probably not if you watch content on your phone it seems that youre better off with the notch
"You already have to reach up and swipe down from the upper right corner to access Control Center and swipe centerdown for Notifications

Is this really going to be that much more of a usability burden"
Have you ever once complained about the notch before
The display goes into sleep mode when placed face down
Hadnt thought about this at all Excellent question
"Im going gold

Every iPhone Ive had except one has been gold"
same im really stuck between purple and black the black is super clean and imo the purple doesnt exactly fit the high end pro status of the 14 pro so tbh idk y im even considering purple lol it feels kinda gimmicky i really wish they had the dark green on this years model tho woulda been the one for me
Thats an android questiondynamic idland will probably just be the top portion of an android phone cutoff and used as a dynamic island
My battery health percentage went down a percent literally 3 days after the 14 was announced
I think everyone picked up on that yes
Its unbelievable the lengths apple fans will go to justify dumb design decisions omg this is revolutionary every Android manufacturer will copy this for sure not like my android right now has a pinhole which is barely noticeable so I get access to my whole display Pure delusion
Lmao huge let down it feels like such a cope  software and hardware  like shut up yall just couldnt get more LEDs on the screen 
Yaaaaass
I regret my iPhone 12 pro so this might be a good new choice
Well it mist have something to do With the 20 drop of euro vs dollar
Apple would like location youre going to be sent to  dynamic Island for not liking their phone lol
Its incredibly stupid Apple fans just love new iPhones Im glad I got out of that cult years ago
You can still have two black bars
They didnt push the pill further than the notch now you can see a little a bit more and the 2 bars will still give you the same aspect ratio as the iPhone 13
I mean I really dont watch full screen videos on my phone So yeah I love the pillthingy
I actually really enjoy this Outside of the bigger pull cutout Im hoping Samsung adopts this kinda UI somehow It looks so good
Sounds better than just the pill
Im on the gfs old 11 pro after I got her the 13 pro Ive been holding out for USBC and if they dont add USBC Im going back to android lol
Cant unsee usb c port in between the face ID and camera modules
Isnt it the same  61 and 67
"The 14 pro isnt much bigger than the 11 pro 

I think youd get used to it"
I was in a same boat until I got my 12 pro stolen in a club So now Im using my old XS and definitely upgrading
Im in the same boat only with the 12 Max and would love to know too
"I have the exact same phone as you rn and while I cant deny the 14 pro is hella tempting Id personally say its not worth it at this point because overall most of its upgrades over the 13p are basically eye candy If you skipped 13p youre not actually gaining that much with the 14p either

First of all the 12p is still a very good phone overall Then there is the fact that the major upgrades over the 12 for me came with the 13p and that while the 14 does have an incredible camera its not like the 12p is bad

So if the dynamic island and the camera arent absolute musthaves for you they arent for me I would personally advice saving this years investment up for next year which will have all the good stuff from the 13p and 14p  more and then hopefully USBC Thats what Im gonna do anyways"
Removed on the US version The Canadian version amongst others is safe for now
"If they keep the legacy support for physical sims theres a high chance that carriers all over the world will continue to fight supporting Esim Carriers are lazy and refuse adapt to new tech unless forced or it has financial insensitive for them 

This is gonna suck for a small group in the US for a little bit But will be eventually better for most people"
Well USA users get hundreds of dollars off the phone relative to EU prices and we also get 2 years of Satellite coverage for free while most of the world gets zero coverage Id say its a wash on who wins regarding some of the regional choices Depends on what you care about
Its a very niche feature but extremely useful for the few that actually need it
I was on a flight today during the event and sos came up on my 13pm where the signal would normally be and was mmm that is new
Be prepared to never buy another phone ever again then Literally every phone these days with a camera system that isnt trash has a sizeable bump
"Yeah all phones are pretty much the same these days Android offers flexibility and customization well beyond Apple but the cost is an often unpolished experience that requires user effort to enhance and beautify

Apple offers great looking designs out of the box but they lag behind on hardware specs These days thats not a big deal In this case Apple hasnt solved the notch still Theyve given up on beating their competition and theyve decided to rebrand their failure as a feature"
But the iPeople will pay Its true
they have had these prices for a long time ever since the introduction of the iphone x in 2017 if they kept up with inflation it would start at 1200
Wait till every android maker rips this off
"Exactly my first thought Imagine a girl in a beautiful prom dress trying to wipe the front camera with her dress to take clearer selfie on her super expensive smartphone
Year of RD Great Apple
Next innovation  20 Apple Cloth to wipe your front camera for extra sharp clear selfies"
Or people honestly like their stuff But yeah more conspiracies please 
Seriously  Top comment is about how great dynamic island is
Top comments read as shitty infomercials
Your world is about to change coming from 7 plus no matter if you choose 13 or 14
No more physical SIM card tray at all on any of the new models one less place for water to get in
I found the presentation to be lacklustre but some of the iPhone features to be cool That said apart from the satellite Im not seeing the innovation like what Im seeing in android Im staying on my 13PM
"Its back in iOS 16


httpsiimgurcomyO1MrWkjpg"
It is part of iOS 16
Battery percentage is in IOS 16
They put the battery percentage in the battery logo with the new iOS
They can literally just put the  number inside the battery icon
Percent is back in iOS 16
Isnt that back with iOS 16
"Its a new feature on iOS 16 You can argue that its ugly but its there

Im In general I dont even find it necessary battery is great on my iPhone 13 Pro Max and I can just swipe down to go to Control Centre if I need the exact percent"
Yup All new iPhones moving forward will be eSIM only
Aww its so dark in person
Goddamnit why is it so dark
People have been doing this already since the iPhone X with swiping down from the top to access Notification Center Photos turn out just fine
The camera is a pretty big update and lots of people care about that
"Sigh This is why you dont read the title of a clickbait article and make assumptions Its not just Dynamic Island

 2000 nits maximum display brightness vs 1000 on 13 Pro
 Always On Display
 Emergency Satellite SOS capability 
 48 megapixel wide camera lens vs 12 megapixels on 13 Pro
 Up to 3x low light performance across all 3 lenses 
 New Adaptive Camera Flash with 9 LED array
 Action Mode video record with gimbel functionality
 GPU with double the memory bandwidth 
 Crash Detection feature with new sensor hardware 

Seems like a big amount of hardware improvements over last years models to me"
NOT true 3 of those years were objective downgrades to battery capacity
not exactly based on the way u hold ur phone ur more likely to touch the sides of the pill where the camera isnt there so not a big deal and u can very easily wipe it with ur shirt lol everyone tries to make a big deal out of everything and just find anything to pick on
Exactly my thought when I saw interaction with it in a demo video on Twitter
hes fineeee
Because he is not a native english speaker Christ
We literally all got that from watching the keynote video
Yes I think everyone can see that from the video
"You really thought theyd fit all this below in an article title 

 2000 nits maximum display brightness vs 1000 on 13 Pro
 Always On Display
 Emergency Satellite SOS capability 
 48 megapixel wide camera lens vs 12 megapixels on 13 Pro
 Up to 3x low light performance across all 3 lenses 
 New Adaptive Camera Flash with 9 LED array
 Action Mode video record with gimbel functionality
 GPU with double the memory bandwidth 
 Crash Detection feature with new sensor hardware 

Hardly what Id consider an uneventful upgrade"
I just couldnt really put my finger on that accent but I agree with you
"The satellite communication is kinda cool though Too bad again it is exclusive to US and Canada despite almost every country in the world has its own satellite in orbit 

Emergency services via satellite is great especially in my countryPhilippines where super typhoons are becoming the norm And if a typhoon hit cell coverage are usually down for hours or even sometimes days even in places like towns and cities So any means to reach authorities as soon as possible is a great functionality if only it exists outside US"
1099 in the uk
They did elsewhere outside US
Samsung phones have a pinhole camera why would they add a big ugly pill
" incredibly underwhelming

You mustve not heard it comes in purple this year Apple is really doing novel stuff"
Wireless charging makes it not matter
look outside of the US
"They werent wrong There is a huge price increase all across the Europe 

Like 1350 USD for base pro model "
Very underwhelming update I think Apple needs to realise that not everyone is a photographyvideographer Why cant the innovate in other aspects specifically a major push in battery RD would be amazing
Markedly better camera  which is enough for many people
No none of the 4 models they announced today have type C
Yes Its just a gimmick
You get used to it just like we got used to no home button and the notch
Squares are ugly lol havent been a thing in forever on phones laptops or watches
"It is Theyre calling it deep purple

Although this bugs me Apple is all about the details and all the other Pro colors were named after stonesmineralselements Not sure why theres a break in theme and continuity here

Silver Gold Graphite

This new color shouldve been named Amethyst Last years Sierra Blue shouldve been Aquamarine Both after gemstones with the same color hue

And Graphite for some reason has been renamed Space Black for this new generation"
My criticism is around it turning out to be the MacBook Touch Bar So much potential but developers didnt utilize it and it became a real letdown
I just want more room at the top for notification icons
I kinda do want to live on the dynamic island though I like it
Is dynamic island available for 13 pro max 
Price is way too high in Europe and in Germany most people are still using sim cards due to providers
"This weird 

People I HATE the notch

Apple disguises it in a new interactive notifications UI

People Actually put the notch back 

SMH"
Same  and the AOD
If you have money to throw away in these times then why not Do consider though that you will be investing into another lightning port phone isnt the smartest idea since they will be forced to change to USB C very soon
You mean like the AOD androids had for years that apple just caught up with
"The dynamic island is seriously impressive And a bunch of haters were talking about how Apple is behind Android when the pill leaked 

And I say this as an owner of the iPhone 13 Pro Galaxy Z Fold4 and Surface Duo so Im not an Android hater"
All what features What features have been held back this year
Especially  when I put a black case on it so it doesnt break if I drop it
Processor battery screen camera
People already are doing that when they pull down for Notification Center Photos turn out just fine
Sadly there is still a notch its just hidden
How do you get to control center
Why would it be called dynamic island Your changing fingers touching Also the amount of space your finger touches your phone isnt a lot
"Its an onscreen motion graphic Its clever but it is not sliced bread Extremely easy to implement on Android devices with punch hole cutouts

Id be surprised if we didnt see a half dozen dynamic island apps in the playstore by the end of the month"
Theyre just making a painful feature of the device a little more cute and adding some smudging to the front camera when you try to use the screen in that spot If thats innovation innovation is dead
Funny because thats how I found your comment lol
This is the Apple subreddit what do u think would happen
"12MP to 48MP camera is minuscule improvement Damn what were you expecting

Im also disappointed that theyre dragging their feet on USBC but dogshit is a bit much no"
This is somethin broke people say Whats it like being broke broke booii
"I mean considering there are a metric fuck ton of people in this world besides yourself I would imagine a good number of those havent bought a new phone in a few years 

So it appears that youre the stupid one for not realizing this"
No difference with a screen protector
The hardware is under the screen
Look I love LG and Im still sad to this day that they went out of the mobile market but thats literally a reach Theyre not the same thing LGs is supposed to be a second screen for functions and Apples is to smartly hide the pill notch
lol thats not even the same Ones a entire second screen and apples implementation is animations around a camera cutout
"Look I love and use Android did it first but Apple did it better Im rather surprised how Samsung and Google used hardware to solve this issue rather than improving on the software

Dynamic Island is basically the best of both worlds  it borrows the peeking feature from early Android as well as the modern music controls and heads up notifications straight from Android 13 The fact that it peeks and animates so slickly is the main feature and the Google crowd must be beating themselves up for not going the extra mile"
"Can you link us to the Android phones that can communicate with satellites Since you know apparently all this tech in iPhone 14 Pro is from 2018 according to you

Ill wait"
"I cracked my phone screen Im so disappointed and underwhelmed by the 14 Im just going to stay away from flagships for a while 

Ill get a 400 android mid ranger as my next phone Its been years since flagships excited me and its time I put my money where my mouth is"
To be fair in the Its same shit same price in the US at least
"HmmmI actually love the dynamic island but you bring up a good point 

Guess thats why Apple put the lock screen widgets at the bottom of the screen Seems more difficult with this since a camera at the bottom is the worst possible placement"
Do your really think its good idea to constantly touch area aroundnear camera Its gonna have smudges all the time
" Borderless notchless islandless full front screen with camera under the screen

Do you think they dont want to Apple doesnt just have a camera to tuck under there  they have a dot projector and IR sensor I believe the proximity sensor is already under the screen so were good there

And get rid of the damn camera protrusion on the back

Nah The camera is very important to a lot of their customers You might not like the bump but lots of other people would rather have it and better photos than not have it

Apple suckering fanboys 

And annoying the haters clearly

Shrug"
Its the same price as last year
Itsthe same price at least in the US what are you clowning on about
Yeah screw him for having an opinion and sharing it
Because he will get disliked to hell if he talks about it truthfully After all mostly apple fanboys watch that video
Ew
Still 999
Not actually a notch its a pill shaped cutout at the top of the screen with animations and UI elements that surround it and change based on context and what you have running in the background Good short little demo video httpsyoutubeWuEH265pUy4
Imagine being in 2022 and still caring about someone having a different opinion on a phone than you lmao
Barely any androids have that
I think apple is well aware that 120hz is abysmal in comparison Itll probably cut into their sales considering
Youd have to corner off the edges of the whole phone for rounded corners on the screen to just not look weird and that would horrifically uncomfortable
"Yes if you want any of the following updates

 Always on display 
 Brightest iPhone display ever 2000 nits maximum
 48 megapixel wide camera lens
 2x better low light performance on all 3 camera lens
 Emergency satellite SOS
 Former notch is now a highly interactive UI feature"
"8AM EST

You can pre preorder it later today but it just saves your configuration"
Of course there is
There never is They add a little something here and there and make a whole hour expanding on that little something to make it sound like the next great thing when all they can do is add it to the next ios update
13 pro to 14 is downgrade Try using camera of 13 pro and 14 pro in mall and if there is no major difference for you then leave it
That has to be the upgrade for next year Come on they cant give you both in one year Gotta protect the upgrade cycle
"If you look at what theyre doing with the new AirPods case with its increased range of possible wireless chargers it seems very likely that theyre banking on more and more people switching to wireless charging to the point where they might skip USBC altogether on the standard models

The only time I plug my phone in is in my car for CarPlay My bedside charger is a Belkin 3 in 1 wireless charger for my phone watch and AirPods I suspect the tipping point will be tied to when most cars have wireless charging and wireless CarPlay as standard"
I use a jailbreak to black out around my notch Im happy with this decision Apple went with may be my first non jailbroken iPhone ever
Not really theres not a lot of room to the sides of the notch since the pill is technically smaller So no real way to do it without completely taking over the status icons Plus the notch itself isnt touch sensitive whereas it appears the island is
I much prefer this to the hole punch method
Nothing its the exact same as last years model
game changer 
You mean like the status bar notifications Android phones have always had
Android does not have an ugly notch removing usable space from your screen
while movies its turned off so only the cutout stays so basically same as with the notch
Basically no improvements rather depends on how much you care about the camera
Pro starts at 999 same as last year
Ssdd

You might need to wait for the iPhone 18 with floppy disk support and a serial port
I wouldnt say theyre losing anyone actually Last years stream is sitting at 20M views while this years stream is sitting at 17M views after only 3 hours
What you described was simply color around the circles Nothing like Dynamic Island
But but US media is calling it great innovation
Its a place for all of those annoying notifications that used to take over the screen like when you get a phone call Now it just appears there instead of making the entire screen useless It will also show any active background apps So if you have podcast going while you are surfing the web youll see that there
Me got money
Na nobody is They have lost a ton of market share  Customers want more soul
You came here just  to say that Feeling fulfilled
"The exchange rate has gotten a lot worse Since brexit import duties have increased quite a bit like 60 percent increase I dont know if this is the reason they are raising the price over the US since I dont do their pricing but that could be impacting it

It also could just being apple being greedy Someone has to pay for those ads to make you feel good about spending all that money for a phone"

You gonna be sleeping very long Night night
I believe both iPhones are now eSim only
Im personally going too
Usually Friday 8 am I think pst Download apple store app
1099 same as previous years
"Its still in the same place they moved it in the iPhone 13 line

The front speaker is imbedded in the thin bezel at the top right up against the stainless steel structural band around the device"
They aim to deliver on the 16th iirc
I ordered mine on the day preorders opened last year and picked up in store the day it came out
"It will likely be equal if not slightly better considering the display can now ratch down to 1hz refresh compared to 10hz refresh at the lowest in the 13 Pro Or 60hz in the regular 13 and 14

The lower the display refresh capability the less battery it draws And the display is the biggest consumption of battery in the device"
They are moving towards it I have a physical and esim and the esim can be troublesome at times but it works just as well when all set up
I went to ATT last year to get the 13 pro and they were REALLY pushing eSIM
Happy cake day
Best Buy
Islanders rejoice
Its literally on Apple website when you try to buy new iPhone  Its 1400 CET Europe time
"Youre right 

Super Pro XDR Pill Max sounds so much better"
Same device just a different size
Most definitely
Definitely
There are good chunk of X13 screen protectors that cover everything except for the speaker cutout Id imagine they would still have those variants available for the 14
Dynamic screen protectors
Thats been rumored to be on the iPhone 15 for a bit now No one really expected it this year sadly
Lightning
Yea every model outside the us essentially
Only 14 Pro
I suspect it will work in the US My guess is this us based on Apples relay service they are implementing
I have XR coral right now with clear case Was thinking about buying a nice color of OtterBox popsocket case never had it in a nice color but now I want the deep purple one other ones are meh to me and dont want to cover the color haha
Same Ive actually never bought the newest model of phone but this one is calling to me
It isnt 48MP sensor Seems like its somewhere above 12 with an odd number like 16 and crops to 12MP uses that electronic image stabilization to produce the HDR off the raw files nice update prolly will look more natural than using compressed  images and THEN does pixel shift like the Sony cameras basically does what it just did 4x by moving the capture over 1 pixel in a quadrant effector quadrupling the 12MP up to 48MP
By the looks of it apple just did a ux change so they can expand the black part when they want Its neat but my god youd think they invented free power based fo these comments Everyone remorgaging their house to upgrade
I can barely tell what everyone is going crazy about Can you explain
"Yes I saw the UK site and I guess they are only marketplace who have increased the cost

I checked usa and uae and its exactly same as last year 

I guess even india has increased"
Nope still lightning I doubt we will ever see it on an iphone  regulation only kicks in 2024 and they might go full wireless by then
The new iPhone has Bluetooth 53 hence why they didnt mention 52 
Exactly my point Satellite connectivity is good but I guess 01 would ever need it Rather concentrate of connectivity on earth Mobiles from last year are built with wifi 6e
They drop the preceding years pro line every year
No the speaker is in the same place as the 13
Definitely no
Do it if you wanna research if its worth it to you
Puts on shades But does your car get thsatellite
Or ya knowa fingerprint reader in the display
The pillshaped notch is black and isnt noticeable with the dynamic island Which is just a dynamic UI area for popup notifications they added a black backdrop around the notch which makes it look like its part of this new notification popup at the top of the screen Looks decent its centered around the pillshaped notch to make it seem less noticeable and free up some screen real estate
Its like the pill or at least the black area around it shrinks or grows depending on what youre doing in a way that makes the pill look almost invisible
I mean yeah its just trying to mask it really
Thats a good book btw
You should receive it on launch day
Yeah I really was hoping for a bezelless design
always on display and a brighter display new Sat comm SOS feature
No its the marketing name for the pill cutout
Theyre not selling the 13 pro max they took it out of the lineup Its just the 13 and the 13 mini only
I swap sims often this was a bummer to hear
Neg
Yeah the green is nice ngl
Its a gimmick What counts is proc battery and camera All got mild improvements from an already excelent level Were rarely going to see much more than that moving on so they need the ocasional cool gimmick to market the package better Sometimes it sticks sometimes users hate it and Apple backtracks a few steps fown the road
"I have never heard an adult iphone user pretend that Apple invented stuff that theyd already seen on Android phones Some people are just excited that the phone they want iPhone has a new feature They dont care whether some Google phone has that feature if they are not in the market for the said Google phone

I know several Android users who define themselves by irrationally hating iPhone and cant miss an opportunity to talk about it Online any Reddit post about using something Apple turns into an Android fanboy circle jerk I hate to break it to you but Android users surpassed iPhone users in douchiness a long time ago

Typing on my OnePlus"
"Agreed

But I for sure miss 3D Touch"
The 16th
No because those still have a notch The pros have the pill cutout
Correct
"I dont think Apple would believe anyone except tech reviewers and those developers who need a test device would upgrade just for the the dynamic island Heck most people dont upgrade for between 35 years The iterative improvements each year add up to a huge upgrade for those people This is just one more small iterative improvement

I expect the camera improvements would get more people over the line"
So dont buy them
"This is what happens to a mature product category The low hanging fruit is all picked and you either have to start throwing everything at the wall like Samsung or do smaller more iterative upgrades

Computers cars microwaves It happens everywhere"
It has a better camera  and lots of people care about the camera
Its what they are referring the UI as and how notifications appear
"It seemed that Apple hardly did any significant improvement in comparaison to 13 pro 

This is what happens to a mature product category The low hanging fruit is all picked and you have to do smaller more iterative upgrades

Computers cars microwaves It happens everywhere

 But for the ones who upgrade every 3 years or som and the price tag is heavy on their wallet

For the ones who upgrade every three years or so the upgrade is cumulative and therefore much larger

its quite disappointing to see such a minor upgrade that will probably over shadowed by the next iPhone because Apple tends to do more significant upgrades every 3 years

Thats not quite true Apple changes the external look every three years but its not always a significant upgrade once you get past that"
Been kind of thinking like you now for a few years I am going on year 56 and still dont see a reason to upgrade for how I use a phone others use phones differently so their needs are different  I was kind of hoping something would get announced here but didnt see it  COVID is still probably slowing them down Think a lot is because there just isnt a killer app that is only on the new phones Guess the satellite thing is kind of that but I dont camp in the mountains and my cars have SOS crash notification like this is talking about  Guess it depends on how you use it or suffer from FOMO and need that latest gadget which I understand
Not that it would account for everything but dont forget that the USA applies sales tax after purchase and everywhere else Im aware of does it to the displayed price
"This is likely whats going to happen Dynamic Island seems to be a placeholder solution until Apple is able to come up with a solution that they deem elegant enough to bring to market 

Dont really see that happening for another few years"
This is like windows8 all over again Anything changing the user experience in a drastic way will always be met with intransigence  Also New Coke failed for similar reasons  Brand recognition sells better than New  Improved

"I dont think Spotify has much control over that edit its definitely Spotifys fault  
Ive always thought of it as HomePod hasnt implemented Spotify support"
Spotify will find a way to not be on that island
Apple will fuck around and make it exclusive to the music app Im sure
 My guy its not some massive new product for Spotify to build launch its just an API they need to send some data to Apple already has a music playback template for them to use It shouldnt take more than a few developers a few weeks to add support for something like this the cost to Spotify would be a rounding error
In this case more like the complete lack of them
"Family sharing with Android users

Why werent all devices given this sort of notch functionality

Edit I appreciate the comments giving an explanation But this is a rhetorical question We all know exactly why this software related update is ONLY for the island not the notch 

Shameless software update Apple"
I have a feeling this will end up being the MacBook Pro Touch Bar for the iPhone  Will probably be gone in 2 years once under screen technology is perfected
What exactly is cool about it It seems to function much like android notification bar which has been there for a very long time
"How It just replaces your entire notifications bar with a single notification enlarged Why would I ever want to hide my notifications bar to take a phone call That just kills multitasking 



My Android phone has this same feature except that its a bubble I can drag around to any location on the screen or even hide"
Its a notification bar I will never understand apple fanbois
"The feature around it is so fucking cool 

Itsa screen"
Stuff like this is what I love about Apple Tempted to switch from Android sometimes Shit over here doesnt feel that fluid lol
Eh It reminds me of the Touch Bar and we know how that turned out Happy to be proven wrong though
What feature You mean having notifications with a black background Jesus
Feature is cool but not PRO worthy Its just visual stuff
"It looks cool but Im not sure it will be in practice Smudging the front camera responsible for faceid with fingerprints seems like a bad idea

Edit Check out where her fingers go giggityhttpsyoutubeFJZApRagqjc"
Isnt it just a simple task bar
" The feature around it is so fucking cool

About as cool as the touch bar  gimmicky for a minute then just annoying"
The name is hilarious but the concept and animations are honestly really slick Im somehow excited to see it in use
Eh I like the name Its always going to be there and its floating on your screen hence the island part and it can change based on what youre doing hence the dynamic part
Yeah I like what theyve done with it
Arent people going to be touching their selfie camera a lot though
Dynamic hub would have been good
Its like the name was a Floating Afterthought
" God that name is awful
 
 

Worst name theyve ever given anything as far as I can remember"
Yeah Apple shouldve totally called it the Eclectic Strip
"HOW DO WE SAY LATEST AND GREATEST WITHOUT SAYING SANDBOX

Dynamic Island 

YOURE HIRED

"
Does the notch even actually bother people this much or are apple engineers just running out of things to do
i have xiaomi mi mix 4 and i have under display cameras and work perfectly
I am actually glad they kept the notch why do you want eventually all phones to be the same just all screen and yeh iPhone not only kept the notch but embraced it and did this island thingy I have to say apple killed it this year
Everybody is talking about the name thats the whole point  Its clever
Im guessing they wanted to avoid drug associations calling it the Pill
Dynamic means changing it changes
I call it the blob personally
This is peak Apple Take something normal give it a buzzy title and then market it as a feature even if its not
This feature will fade into nothingness in one or two years when they manage to put all cameras under the display
Yea im considering an upgrade  this seems more like marketing than a real feature
"Im liking this trend of referring to screen cutouts as topographical features 

Whats next Dynamic Continent When is the Dynamic Archipelago set to be released"
The camera is already under the display for this phone at least thats what they said in the presentation
Doubt that they said the design is sure to be iconic which to me means itll be around for at least 4 years
Under display cameras are horrible
"With how slick the implementation is I think theyre in this for the long haul 

iPhone 20 is where I suspect Apple will finally ditch any visual interruptions to the screen"
Its a software feature built around the new camera cutout that is replacing the notch
Combination the new camera layout and removal of the notch is hardware the software goes along with the new design
Ever heard of reachability The screen will come down to you if you need it for one handed use I use it all the time
Loving the hit single Taptic Engine
Action Mode is the bands bassist
Lmao
Bro Im dying 
new single called Haptic Engine
Hmmmm
"Im digging the updatesinteractions with it its a fantastic use of space that has otherwise been pretty useless  

The decision to stretch full screen video past the island had me wondering who created the demo animations I assume full screen video will still be stretched from the bottom of the screen to the edge of the island instead of cutting a hole in the side of your video"
I think they should have went with dark void
Can someone explain why dynamic Island sounds funny Genuine question
Black hole of information
Yeah Its actually really cool interacts a lot with the software Can show sports scores Uberlift ride status etc while using the phone
I mean it perfectly describes what it is its a notch is an island of sometimes dead space and dynamically updates based on content Kinda corny but accurately depicted
I think is important when considering the name lol You knew without any other info Part of what we consider as PMMs when we think through naming things
Hahah yall are killing me with these
Somebody correct me if Im wrong but AFAIK interacting with the notch was forbidden by Apple in human interface guidelines Your app wouldnt be approved if you designed uiux for it You had to design like it didnt exist
Stage Manager is even better because it is actually a window manager Yeah this is also really an island of sorts but it doesnt have the pun that stage manager does IMO
Exactly People are blowing up my inbox about how its not innovative or game changing Im not saying that but the limitations of their hardware at the moment have this blemish on the screen this is a pretty brilliant way to disguise it as something more
At least that sounds like a technology This sounds like a game mode in fortnite or something
Is it new information that the part thats not a display doesnt display things
Its a clever way of disguising the notch as a notification manager They just utilize the screen space around it to make it appear less like a blemish on the screen and more like an actually useful feature
I mean go watch a video on it or something then
Yeah this definitely feels like itll be the norm on all models starting next year Like how the full phone screen was exclusive to the X but was the standard the following year
Lol of course they wont port it over you have to upgrade to get it New to Apple
"well isnt the problem that the space used for the infos left and right is the space gained by making the notch smaller

If you port back to older devices you overwrite crucial system info like reception or battery Dont think users or Apple likes that

That said im pretty sure this and the smaller notch is only gonna stay a pro feature for this year and will come to normal iPhone next year"
"How would you port back a hardware feature
Its only on the 14 pro which has a different display cutout than every other iPhone"
Bro its called Dynamic Island not Dynamic Peninsula
The whole concept of it only works with the 14 pros pill shaped cutout Not even the regular 14s will have it
"Hoping they port it to the 13 and other models

Youre adorable"
"It would be nice if they moved beyond a cut out in the screen at all 

And dont but but but Face ID me There are solutions They could go to under screen camera and adopt a finger print scanner either under the screen or on the side of the phone Apple has the resources and talent to develop these technologies beyond thier current and arguably already acceptable state Or they could develop a new face ID projectorsensor that can go under the screen or that go some where else like the top corners"
I highly doubt it Its sleek but android phones dont have a notch and notifications are already displayed temporarily in that same area Itd look silly for notifications to originate from the pinhole cutout
Right I saw the rumored pill shape and thought cool thats more aesthetically pleasing Never thought theyd make it an interactive part of the phone Brilliant design choices with this
Lol no one said that I said its a sleek way to handle them
Genuinely curious what about this makes it harder to use one handed
That number means nothing because thats 29 hours of video playback not regular use that includes turning off the screen
"on 13 pro max often 10 hours of intensive use check out mrwhoesthebosss vid 

probably like 12 hours for a normal user"
They just mentioned all day battery life I think it is probably on par with the old 13 pro max without always on display  but maybe worse with it
Same Blue is my favorite color and I was hoping there would be one more version with it Back to cases I guess
You can wait few months until midseason color is added like alpine green this year
Im going with Purple Looks the best out of the 3 IMO
I have the blue It looks really nice for the 30 minutes a year I take the case off
Same what are you leaning towards
Yup the sierra blue on my 13 pro is beautiful Was hoping this 14 Pro kept the color but it didnt guess Im going with silver or gold but leaning more towards silver
I love the purple and Im shocked at so many people complaining no blue or green Purple is 50 of why Im upgrading
My 13 pro was my upgrade phone but it was stolen so at least on the bright side I have an excuse to get a 14 now
Same Im in a X right now just waiting for USBC
They could have said we went back to the iPhone 8 and put in usbc now 1500 and Id have been way more excited than this
"You would buy or not buy a phone just because of a color

Edit I had no idea there were so many caseless monsters out there yall are wild"
Ive never understood why anyone cared what color their phone is I always wanted blue until they sold out last year and I got stuck with blackspace grey It was at that moment that my phone just looks whatever color the case I put it in is and Ive completely forgotten my phone was black to begin with
Fax
Oh theyre totally saving a color for later
Havent upgraded my 11 yet becuase I love the colour Looks like Im just going to buy a refurbished one with more storage
All colours are gender neutral
This actually makes me think theyll never put the camera behind the screen Because this is such a clever and useful solution to the problem and then they dont have to sacrifice any quality that may come with behind the screen
They probably have the next 23 years of phones already made Just have to roll them out year by year for money
Theres already technology to put the camera behind the screen There was a cheap Android phone that had it years ago The problem is Apples tech probably makes it too hard to implement just yet
Or they could just have a slightly larger top bezel its pointless to me
I wonder why they cant put the sensors and camera behind the screen already I think theres a few other phones which do this already And I dont think people care about quality of front camera much
i mean sure its a neat way to incorporate it into your ui design but that doesnt change the fact that there is still a massive black hole in my content so ye this does nothing for me i would never buy any phone with a notch or holepunch no matter how cool the design
Just use touch id in the display
Apple is years behind Samsung here They are the only ones still using a notch
shaggy trees toothbrush aback cough label paint combative forgetful outgoing  mass edited with redactdev
"The camera is already behind the screen on my Samsung Z fold 4  Oh  and my phone turns into a tablet

But yeah enjoy your new notifcation bar I guess  LOL"
Eventually theyll figure out how to make the actual island move too 
honestly this is so good why even bother moving it all under having it above is probably better quality no matter what
I dont think Apple will put it behind the screen for the foreseeable future All the parts of the screen interfere too much with the front cameras
It is already more than possible look at Samsung Galaxy Fold for example
called it a feature
"lol a feature very literally squeezed around a pretty obvious obstruction

in every one of their fancy custom displays all i can see is the giant gap the really small graphics on each side of that black void look v strange to me think i liked the notch better at least it was honest"
Cant decide whether its genius or bcs consumers are gullible Or its genius bcs they keep find ways to exploit gullible consumers
"No they didnt except to ignorant people

They didnt turn it into a feature they turned a feature into an obstruction because now the common basic generic Notification Area  System Tray  Touchbar equivalent whatever you want to call it is artistically and artificially restricted to a specific color black and position shape and sizein order to deceitfully confuse perception of the terrible notch"
How is this a feature vs just having a punchole on the corner and actually having screen there
"Calling it a feature is rather generous and implies that it wasnt done as an attempt to mitigate the ugliness of the design  i wouldnt call it a feature since its not really doing anything new phones have been showing graphics at the top of the screen since forever only now theyre bundling the graphics into a black puddle around the hole so that the pill appears more intentional

regardless I think this will be effective at fooling the general public into thinking the pill is intentional and not just an ugly byproduct of apples current phone design"
I love it It will be a game changer for day to day use if thirdparties take full advantage
no they made the obstruction larger  That space on either side of the notch wasnt completely useless and now individual apps can commandeer it Ill reserve judgement until I see it in person but Im honestly unenthused by this  I expect Ill have to wipe off the front facing camera a lot more often and not feel like I got anything useful from the feature
They took a major annoyance for a lot of people made it MORE intrusive then put some graphics around it and call it a feature Why didnt they just put graphics around a camera hole punch Oh yeah because any android could do that but no android manufacturer is going to upsize their notch and call it a feature Apple doesnt mind going backwards in innovation now because it has a cult following
"I still remember people reacting to the AirPods saying I will never buy these they look like electric toothbrush heads 

Fastforward a couple of years and they were everywhere"
I think replace the first comment from consumers to reddit and it becomes fairly accurate I do remember seeing everyone on reddit bitching about how removing headphone jacks are just apple pushing to reduce costs or airpods are gonna flop due to how easy they are to lose
Well its par for the course at MacRumors
"	Great now all phones are gonna change their shit ui to mimic this

FTFY"
iPad Apollo app first tho
Steve is that you
retweet
I cant wait to see how you react to what they do with it
I cant wait to see what you see what they do with it
Can it run doom
Are you Tim Cook
Aaahh I wasnt sold on the purple until you said that
Because youre using the Apollo app he made
This stuff is normally quite a bit easier than writing a different app p
Might want to chilllllll
Thats just an ahole comment and disrespectful
You can put stuff in it see keynote
Not totally sure how that works I believe Apple said the developer stuff is launching with iOS 161 so hopefully around whenever that is
Everyone who pays for Apollo ultra should get their names a different color in the app so the 99 know were better than them
I cant believe this didnt leak Like at all
Its kinda amazing how excellent UI implementation changed my opinion on hole punch cutouts in an instant Everyone else just kinda leaves it there but Apple actually went ahead and integrated it smoothly into the software portion of it Id be curious to see how it actually looks in person though with the camera and other physical aspects likely a bit more visible
Definitely the best feature of the whole event Great innovation and a good way to make use of the new camera pill
Cleanses the pallet after that iPhone 13 14 reveal
I know for real Im actually kinda pissed off I hadnt planned on upgrading from my 13 but Apple went out and did a thing and now Im second guessing
rHailcorporate
Looks like I might be updating from my 12 pro max
Same When I first saw the 14 Pro I thought ehhh its only software changes and internal hardware changes When I saw the always morphing pill I was blown away Something pretty minor but honestly one of my favorite things in recent releases
Agreed Im glad my iPhone X died at a time when theres a real upgrade coming and Im forced into this lol
"The person presenting the feature said it but it really is a quintessential Apple thing to do The old way of showing notifications was perfectly acceptable but this is hands down better looking and more functional And it incorporates the inconvenient necessity of the cutout and turns it into a marketable feature 

THAT is the kind of innovation Apple is known for and its exciting to see that they can still pull it off"
Wow by a feature that has been on other phones for years hilarious
"Man I just got a 13 pro max because I needed a new phone asap Man that purple and dynamic island really makes me regret it especially because purple is my favorite color

The fact that they showed off purple so much was like it was rubbing it in my face"
lmao it looks exactly the same shit
Its definitely the next step forward from the notch
Agreed Im glad the 14 Pro or max depending on size will be replacing my iphone 8 plus
I wouldnt go that far They just made some notifications blend in with the huge pill cut out
Where did the phone speaker get moved to Is it that little slit adjacent to the top edge
"Pretty much a stroke of genius from Apple TBH

httpsyoutubeyInN7OV4M3k"
From my stance Samsung included those features in the flip series and apparently embraced the udc in the fold line improved it from the camera from the fold 3 I pray Samsung continues to do what it has been doing because its great
" but no one has thought about creating UI around it

Jailbreak community has They have been playing with the notch since day one of iPhone X being jailbroken Theres NotchBanners Notchification BatteryNotch I am just scratching the surface"
"I really dont think they are Other manufacturers are leading the way with thinner bezels and notchless screens under display selfie cameras and away from the ugliness of the notch I like Apple products and no doubt the front facing camera and face unlock experience is miles ahead on iPhones but it is such a dated design to look at and isnt enjoyable when watching fullscreen content

Lets hope the UX team smash this and it doesnt turn into something they discard looking at you Macbook touch bar"
"httpswwwgizmochinacom20200508samsungpatentsasmartphonewithastatusindicatoronapunchholecamera

There was a patent for a status indicator but I guess they favoured a general approach to interactivity that fits round and oval hole
Punches"
not really everyone prefers as close to full screen experience as possible
Thats not true at all LMAO Theres ton of apps for Android that offer new UI features Battery ring around the camera is a super common one but others exist
"Ummmno Everyone has moved past notches and large cutouts
Cope"
"  


Is it 2016 No one else has notches"
You think the rest of the industry is going to go back in time 5 years to the time of large notches just to do some fancy animations around them instead of doing fancy animations on the screen Apple is the only one that still has such a large section of the screen blocked out
"Man is everyone gonna rip this off immediately

Pill cutouts have been around for years but no one has thought about creating UI around it

httpsyoutubeyInN7OV4M3k"
"Samsung The Dynamic Island is stupid and dumb

Also Samsung two weeks later We have implemented a software feature for our cutout called Lively Archipelago"
Is Samsung the one that designs the global OS and app features of Android like that
" Samsung is going the completely opposite direction with trying to mask the cutout Watch how hard they 180 that shit

I doubt they will honestly  As cool as this idea is its clearly going to be adapted for use with a behindthescreen iPhone whenever that comes out  The notch will be gone but the status bar isnt going anywhere and not having a giant hole there will open up more flexibilities with an alldigital dynamic island

I would more expect to see Android devices copy Apples notes with the way their status bars work though  Its very sleek and smart"
Haha apple polishes a turd then apple sheep eating that shit up
I hope not that is just wasted screen estate
Rip it off immediately like Apple has already ripped it off from the Jailbreak community Man
Me too But the thought of next year Usb C holding me back
Same haha I bought X on release and honestly performance is amazing and display is still amazing to todays standard and thought I will get 13 pro for 120hz but idk just didnt care enough I want 14 pro so badly and cant wait to buy it
Would be nice if they leaned into it with other models too Down with artificial limitations
They really could add some animations for the 13 but Im sure they wont
And sports scores especially in fast updating sports eg basketball tennis
CALLER ID
I didnt think it was wasted space before but now I do Dynamic island looks like its meant to prioritize form over function lol Rip notification bar
Its the most Apple thing possible
The reality distortion field working overtime today I want the notch too goddammit
I have a 13 Pro and honest to god had every intention of using it at least 23 years Yet here I am about to upgrade barely one year later
Its called marketing and its a sheeps favorite drug
That would be sick The galaxy fold does it nicely with the internal screens camera but Apple is always king with the animations
Eh while I think everyone would prefer to have no pill the animations wouldnt look as cool if it came from nothing
No shit
What would they even put on the top of the screen once they remove the notchpill
yeah I need stop calling it a notch  Its an Island
Yep All Android major players have been putting cameras below the screen and it looks like shit Now Android is going to go back to notches again And its gonna be hilarious
Its the greatest notch weve ever released
I foresee them introducing exactly the same feature but app devs using it to a much lesser degree to the point where most people forget it even exists
But then people might realize that all the phones should get this feature
The lack of a touch screen on the Mac would probably make the notifications annoying to swipe away Also the Mac has the old notch which isnt getting the dynamic island notifications
"Weird thought but it seems like Windows Phone with its active home screen really was a good idea after all

Widgets Dynamic Island Lockscreen widgets Sorry if those have a special name I dont use an iPhone shocker they all remind me of it"
Yeah the bubbly stuff is hella cute and adds a tiny but of fun into the UI that I would not mind seeing extended into other stuff
"Cool things being removed is very Apple Though obviously if they get everything behind the screen theres no reason to keep it 

I will forever be mad they retired force touch I assume hardly anyone knew it existed but as someone who did taking that feature away made iOS so much worse"
"Ive used holepunch phones for years and personally find it easier to ignore a hole punch because the perimeter of the phone is fully uniform with pixels

Obviously the change will be be different if youre used to the notch but my preferences line up with wanting a symmetrical perimeter over a notch to immerse me into the phone shape"
"Its OLED Blacks reach darker blacks because they can turn off the pixels as if the screen were off

How noticeable is the notch for you when the screen is off"
The 14 Pro is the only one with the camera cutout instead of a notch it wouldnt make sense on any other models
I mean excessive but I agree it would translate to the notch
The Pro models routinely get features that the basic models dont The basic models will get it in a year or two
"Whatever team decided that was pretty damn smart 

Use the power users and people more likely to flaunt their material objects to test run it Also get feedback from the people that spend more money on the product in general 

Its a good way to also draw a clear line between iPhones Its not just a bigger screen this time If you cant afford the real and latest iPhone youll know every time you use it Regardless of anyones personal experiences this will be a very intended effect of this design choice"
ok zoomer
"iOS 7 is still misunderstood a decade later Jony kept saying it was designed in harmony with the hardware Apple hardware was generally quite minimalist and simple in design a decade ago so iOS 7 reflected that

iOSwatchOSmacOS now reflects the whimsy of Apple hardware designs"
Screenshot
Ironic since Mac products particularly butterfly keyboard era ones have given me infinitely more headaches than my computers running windows
Cool thing is that when that tech appears this interaction model still works great The physical cutout can shrink or change shape in future years and it wont mess with UI design at all Thats pretty elegant
Itll be better to have a phone that doesnt need to charge too if were just spit balling ideas obviously limited by the current mass produced tech
Like the predecessor notch this is the next thing on the iPhone thatll last another 5 years until technology progresses to make the camera under the screen possible
It seems like something that could potentially be enabled via a jailbreak tweak on an SE 2020 for example
The drag race dolls are outside
Bye Im dying seeing this on the Apple subreddit hahaha
Wiwow But in all seriousness ty for the laugh 
rrupaulsdragrace is leaking haha
It is did you see the presentation
How is it not You can touch it and activate elements around it Thats literally what interactive means
My opinion  your opinion
Im thinking the same Very sleek and the first thing to wow me so far
Sat typing on an 11 pro thinking the same thing Its a stupid gimmick But so cool with classic stupid Apple name that makes me want to Chuck my money at them like the easily led consumer than I am
Im thinking about it as well but the no physical SIM card tray is concerning
"Im very tempted too its definitely looking like a worthwhile upgrade

Just wish they made MagSafe stronger"
Yeah if I wasnt poor af Id upgrade my 11 pro as well
I kinda want to switch to it from my 12 Pro Max now to be honest  I do wish they would keep some of the older Pro colors around particularly the blues and the greens
Coming from an 11 pro as well  Excited about the camera upgrades  And as someone who enjoys hiking the security satellite communications offer is a nice boon
Yeah that was deliberate Why talk about minor improvements when you can instead talk about what a major improvement it is compared to an older or less powerful chip
The 2000 nits is outdoor brightness not sure if this involves HDR or not
I wish the iPhone had something like Vivid on the new MacBook Pros You can up the brightness to max HDR brightness even without HDR content I use it all the time when outside and it blows my mind still
"I end up watching most of my content on my phone Id prefer to use my oled tv But the truth is as a new parent theres Barely an hour a week I can sit down in front of it

My point being the hdr improvements are nice for me"
At least it affects photo library too for both photos and videos
Same for the satellite calls how much more expensive has this feature made the device
I watch full length movies on my phone often I love it I cant be sitting in front of a tv all the time Plus PiP had made it so I can watchlisten to movies and keep an eye on the markets lol
Yeah Im in agreement with you USB 20 speeds on an 1100 phone is just gross
"USB 20 480Mbps

WiFi 6 2Gbps

I cant think of a use case where someone would use the lightning port to do large data transfer"
Is it common to connect to a computer for data transfer anymore Its be nice to be the faster standard Particularly for some pro workflows But its hardly a pressing need for the vast majority of users
Software stuff is a bit easier to hide but it does go to show that the hardware really is only half the equation
Honestly Im impressed Theyve gone a long way from leaving a fully functional iPhone 4 in a bar
"	I never believed that they would introduce something that is not symmetric 

I remember people saying this about the iPhone 4 steel band when it leaked"
" Probably that rumor was based on the hardware design of the sensors

Wellyeah

I dont understand the people acting like leakers whiffed it when they produced accurate dummy units and got most of the technical details right  No mini a 14 Plus 48mp wide camera AOD pill etc


Yall just need to learn to take these things with a pinch of salt By the end of the summer we tend to get a very clear picture of what the new iPhones will look like and feature in terms of hardware because the amount of fingers in that pie is insane  Leaks are allbut inevitable when you have Apple placing various orders for specific parts handing out dummy units to case manufacturers and so on

Software though is much more unpredictable due to the fact that Apple can test it entirely internally and leaks are more easily traced to the source

Apple threw a curveball with the software design around the new notch sure but the leaks were extremely accurate beyond that"
"Exactly  This is kind of a known thing so I dont understand why people are gloating like leakers have major egg on their face right now  This shit was probably tested by an incredibly small group of people why am I supposed to take this as proof that they know nothing when just about every other major feature of the phone48mp camera notch AOD was called a long time ago

Leaks arent gospel If youre reading them that way then youre reading them incorrectly"
I would love to believe its intentional because of some of these YouTuberinfluencerleaker types should be embarrassed with how hard they went in on it Full on 3D renders smh
Maybe but I can see the persistent notifications being useful even after the notchisland is all under the display
"More than that The array of sensors and cameras on the front might shrink but that just frees up more space for new sensors or cameras 

This is the next decade of iPhone"
Why It was terrible finally Apple caught up with Androids Now all were missing is USBC
As a very opinionated person when it comes to UX I loved it
Same as a fisherman I was wowed
As a leather smith I too was wowed
Yeah same really like it
Yeah this will be an example people point to when people say that Apple may not do it first a cutout but they do it better
I think Samsung tried making camera cutouts somewhat useful back when they released the first or second phone with a screen camera cutout where if you touch the area of the cutout it would open up the camera but it didnt last long because it smudged the camera more than being useful lol
Android already has a notificationsettings centre and the  top bar shows notifications Apple made it more playful
"Yep this is one of the UX things Im interested in seeing Also smudging the crap out of your frontfacing camera I dont really use my frontfacing camera often but I imagine some people might get annoyed with the smudging   


Im not sure how often youre going to actually be interacting with the island UI though"
My thoughts exactly
I switched from being Android for several years to an iPhone X purely for the gestures haha
A lot of those gestures came from Blackberry 10httpsyoutubemHhYAGbEQg
What is gesture navigation
The iPad Pro couldve had a notch for years
Shows how long theyve been working on the problem too Theyve delayed updating other products with modern notches because this part of the design wasnt finished No reason why this cant be on Mac and iPad next
The possibilities are endless now that the notch is a functional feature
"Actually it appears that the notch was the first step for them Thats where they decided to take a dramatic turn and design iOS to accommodate a part of the screen that isnt visible to the user and make use of it

Think about how difficult this is for Android phone manufacturers They cant design a good interface to really work around a notch or hole punch because Google has to do the design work for them

Apples entire design strategy was changed when they worked on iPhone X They knew that there was always going to be a notch in the screen

I dont think theyll ever go the same route with underdisplay sensors because its so much more complicated to pull off With a notch or a pill you can design around it Theyll adopt an underdisplay fingerprint scanner at some point but for now their frontfacing camera tech is IMO in its own league"
" But the notch on the iPhone X was something that was going to be phased out

What Did Apple ever say they planned on phasing out the notch Its 5 years later now and a new iPhone was just announced today that still has the notch"
the pill is here to stay for the next 4 generations of iphone then they will skip a generation and release the  iphone 20 in 2027  20 year anniversary  and that iphone will have full screen 
what feature was that
same
I could see that being annoying if you arent taking advantage of the information being displayed Hopefully they have a way to turn it off similar to how you can configure notification UI
A little But I guess I commend them for coming up with something to hide it I know they want to make an all screen phone happen But since they cant they had to do something with the notch Personally I wouldnt have minded just a black bar at the top and have stuff pop up there without all the animations
Yeah great design seems obvious in hindsight but most people arent going to see the insane number of iterations to get to that point and say things like all they did was X thats easy
" A month ago people used to hate Alan Dye because of macOS redesigns but im always a fan of him after Ive Now people love him

Nope still hate him and think hes an active cancer on macOS and iOS to a lesser extent Some designers on the HI team producing something exceptional doesnt undo all the terrible stewarding of software design hes been overseeing these last few years"
Its meant to distract away from something they cant remove and its probably going to do an amazing job
"Theyre taking something thats generally a downside a notchcutout and turning it in a feature in the OS design Its super smart and well executed As someone who works in the industry I cant understate how difficult coming to a clever solution like this is and then actually executing it well

Yeah obviously the notch is still there but now its integrated into OS features And the design and animation around the activities is high quality"
"  I dont think people are realizing the pill is still there in all those UI iterations

Exactly Thats whats impressive about it"
"Well no shit the pill is still there lol 

Its essentially making the best of the unfortunate necessity that is having a pill by giving it more purpose"
"And this is the problem with internet groupthink The hatred for notches has become damn near a meme at this point 

	I dont think people are realizing the pill is still there in all those UI iterations

Everyone realizes the notch is still there If anything Apple is screaming to the world to look at it They arent trying to hide it theyre making it useful Youll never see that though if you cant move on from notch  bad 

Think about it What is so bad about a notch or a holepunch First they take up usable space on your screen Well with this iteration they turned that space usable They built an experience around it that justifies its existence 

Second they look ugly Again with this interaction Apple has solved that too The animations are stunning and it makes you want to watch as the Dynamic Island moves around Not to mention if you have something like sports scores up there it looks even cooler and youll want to keep looking at it often 

Third it I dont know I cant think of anything else bad about the notch  hole punch If youre still hating on it at this point all I can imagine is that youre still caught up in the hype of hating change in technology headphone jack as another example"
Jesus fucking Christ dude Its interesting and cool Just acknowledge that and move on
"Yeah I really hate it too I am very surprised to see the response But hey if people like it thats cool Im just a guy 

Edit not surprised to see downvotes for people calmly expressing their opinion Classic fucking Reddit"
Its an Apple sub 
Thats not literally all they did Theres a lot that goes into the animations and contextual switching between UI states based on different apps Coming up with this design to solve a hardware problem is also novel and impressive and no doubt took a lot of iteration internally It sounds like youre not that into motion design or UI design nerd stuff or work on things like this and thats okay
"By subjecting devs to it I mean engineers at places like Lyft who will now be working on this features in their app that render in the dynamic Island Its probably not going to be a massive effort on their end like you said but its not nothing 

Right now theres entire companies rethinking their product development to support dynamic island whereas two days ago they didnt even know it existed"
Yep I mentioned the same thing in another comment
1299 for the pro 128gb is a crime
"14 pro starts from 1299 300 more than the US just like M2 lol

God help us"
"1490 USD for base Pro in Hungary

The 11 pro is probably my last iPhone I get brand new"
Here in italy 1339 A damn shame
oof euro really has been falling huh
Thats only a 15 increase Way under the 20 decrease the Euro compared to USD has taken compared to exactly a year ago
Well considering the value of the Euro recently
Yes though it was going crazy Such a disappointment Was really planning on getting a pro and the Island is amazing but I dont know man
Remember that the EU price includes VAT
If EU stopped shooting their foot you can enjoy low prices as well
Thats the strength of the dollar for you
Strong dollar against the euro We plebes are all subject to the whims of monetary policy
Could I afford it Yes Would I always be nervous in public thinking it might be snatched Yes
The US price doesnt include tax
Thats the weak Euro
128gb in 2022 is fucking criminal
Same but 999 for 256 GB was too good to be true This is basically the same as if they had gone up to a 1099 base price with 256 GB If anything it should make the 256 GB model more available at launch because so many people will buy the 128
Just pretend they actually raised the price 100 and whammy youre base iPhone pro has 256GB of storage
"I expected everything to increase by 100 but also bump to next storage tier 

Glad the 14 PM is 1099 Going to buy the 128gb out of spite lol"
Yeah I havent been buying the latest and greatest for years already That price just cemented the fact that Im not going to reverse that decision holy shit
They know that Our currency has devalued though against the dollar though and will most likely continue to over the 2 years theyll sell the 14 for Apple has to do this or theyll effectively be losing money
are both prices using launch prices or prices adjusted after iPhone 14 releases
I saw that lol live in Vienna but going to the US soon will ship it to my brothers house and pick it up there 
"Oh yea I forgot about USBC

Welp let them work out the bugs with the new island for the next year and hopefully iPhone 15 will have USBC Im happy with my 13 Pro"
This why Im buying this phone
Really thought they would have moved to USBC but I guess not
It makes use of the space by providing live notifications Instead of having to switch apps to check on something Uber food order timer etc The notch was a big talking point and somehow they managed to surprise everyone even after the leaks
Youre correct its just implementing notifications and widgets into its own top level interface that doesnt make you switch apps or screens Its just a notch for the camera and sensors with dope animations playing around it
Notifications are useful in that they let a user know whats going on
I would be shocked if it cant be toggled off
The Watch allows you to disable it so iPhone should be the same
Its disabled when the phone is face down or in the pocket so it will only be on when youll look at your phone nice for the extra battery life
Im sure youll be able to toggle it off but based on Androids implementation of always on display of about 5 battery an hour a 16 hour day of no charging it uses 8 Im sure this implantation will use more so maybe 1015 a day Ive never had battery issues before and I still wont with this Worth it in my opinion
I cant imagine it would eat that much battery with a 1 hrz refresh rate and static images Background app refresh and location services are two powerhungry things you should turn off to preserve battery But this doesnt seem like one of them
Its extremely battery efficient Wont really change a lot
Id really like to see how much battery would be saved turning it off Since when always on display is on it lowers refresh rate to 1hz it probably uses almost nothing
The Wall Street journal hands on showed a toggle for it
i mean yea theyre clearly not confident enough to put all of the notch components under the screen yet which sucks but whats so bad about at least changing the ui to make the notch not look like such an eyesore
Because they go down when the new iPhone is launched So far it isnt
Ok cool Yea this may be worth it now given what I would be gaining Always on display notch looks way better and I like how they utilized the screen 120hz refresh rate always on display way better battery life dynamic island
"11 Pro is the best phone Ive ever had

Before that it was the 8

Im going to get a 13 or 14 Pro but will miss the Smart Battery Case"
I was hoping the 14 would have the rounded edges of the 11 pro that feels so nice to hold but no luck
"I feel like 11 Pro to 14 Pro is pretty reasonable

I wasnt really tempted at all on the 12 or 13 series there was nothing wrong with them it just didnt seem to make a big difference but I think Ill appreciate this one Theres some little things Im excited for like getting a MagSafe mount for my car and having a more functional Measure app with the LiDAR the YoY screen upgrades will be noticeable the camera upgrade looks wonderful and the new UI looks great

Im just torn on whether I should sell my 11 Pro or find some use for it around the house"
"well probably see the charging port removed before MagSafe

"
I just look at it like this Since we skipped the 13s last year We get promotion dynamic island always on display way better battery life camera improvements and a much brighter screen Now I wouldnt suggest anyone upgrade from the 13 pro to the 14 pro but arguably 12 pro or below are pretty worthy upgrades imo
"Im with you I think Dynamic Island looks slick but Im surprised how many people are saying they want to upgrade from their 13

Im looking at upgrading from the 12 Mini  love the form factor but the Pro Max cameras just constantly blow me away Had I gone with the 12 Pro Max I doubt this would be enough to make me switch"
Im so with you Genuinely thought that some of the comments about the stand out features were satire Let me know when USB C arrives until then Ill keep my X coming from someone who used to upgrade their phone every year
Yea Im on the fence still Its also lame apple only gives u like 430 for the 12 Pro I honestly hate the colors of the pros and wish they had a blue I dont really want black cuz thats what I have always gotten before I branched out and got the blue for the 12 I low key dont want to part ways with my pacific blue
"XR gang Im still not sure honestly My battery life is fine usually 36 hours without a charge

Despite the relatively poor camera I dont see much of a reason to upgrade Sure I want the shiny new thing but Ive also thought that every year at announce then gotten over it and been just fine

Maybe Im jaded but I just dont see the value in spending 1k when Im still mostly going to be browsing Reddit"
Lol u sound crazy It may not be worth it for you but the 14 pro is a nice upgrade from any 11 series You maybe woulda had a point if u said the 12 but the 11 Nah thats nonsense Anything below a 12 is definitely a upgrade and there are good reasons 5G support MagSafe Promotion AOD Dynamic Island way better camera and battery life
"Same in France iPhones were already expensive
Now its insanely expensive

Were just getting insane increases in almost everything in Europe
What a time to be alive"
And what can you do
I mean  the US is also up a lot against  and   was to be expected
"Thats gotta suck 

Its like a phone costing me 90k"
Holy shit I thought we had it bad in Europe I really dont understand these insane price differences it has the same manufacturing costs after all
"1	Go to Settings  Accessibility  Display and Text Size  Reduce White Point Turn on and adjust to preferred level
2	Go to Settings  Accessibility  Accessibility Shortcut  Reduce White Point

You can now enabledisable a night mode display by triple tapping your side button"
Reduce the white point create a shortcut to automatically reduce it when you start sleep focus mode etc
"Considering OLED can be completely off for night modeit technically gets infinitely dim since the iPhone X

Idk how you can get much dimmer than the pixel being off"
What about nightmode
Nope 2000 nits when outdoor and 1600 nits for HDR contents
Its for outdoor hdr still has 1200 nits peak
Yay
"Nah but useful in direct sunlight 

Also my mom uses full brightness almost all the time"
"If you turn off auto brightness you wont get peak brightness anyway 

Its never a good idea to disable auto brightness on the off chance you never manually set it higher when in a bright environment then cant see the screen to raise it Ive personally seen it happen to people on their phones also people who thought their laptop display was broken but the brightness was all the way down

Just leave auto brightness on You can still manually adjust it regardless it will go back to auto automatically if you sleepwake the screen"
Not to mention the heat that it would generate
"Do you typically stand outside in direct sunlight for an hour on your phone 

It definitely isnt going to sustain 2000 for an hour It wont even let you manually set it above 1000 iirc 2000 is peak under ambient light every iPhone has always dimmed and wont sustain peak brightness under ambient light for very long

So to be more precise no it wont drain your battery This problem was solved for a while now"
But seemingly cant design them as well as Apple can
Actually FWIW this is Apples patented OLED display technology But display vendors just fabricate it
Stupid was a choice of word for comedic effect I do agree that its a nice design However they didnt need the Island to accomplish it The same design and feature set could have been accomplished using a notch as well  its a feature Apple could have given us years ago
Um FROM 1499  the 1TB version is over 2100
Euro dropped 20 and US prices dont include taxes
1200 USD is 1202 not 1450
Apple Store
UK price Pro Max starts at 1199 and Pro starts at 1099
Its 1099 in the UK LMAO with our new energy bills nahhh
I rather pay extra for an iphone and have free healthcare than be poor for the rest of my life cause i had a serious health issue
Its the exchange rates not consumer protections
40 dollars
They would have promoted it if they were
The 13 Pro was 1169 euro The 14 Pro is 1339 euro Explain how those prices are the same And dont come at me with inflation Samsung didnt increase the price of the Fold 4 here
"They actually havent given up yet Theyre still selling new iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini at a discount 

The 13 mini was 699 new last year Now its 599 new 

If they see interest at that price level we may see a future mini phone"
"You sound like one of those folks who makes a mockup of a notchless edgetoedge paperthin transparent iPhone in 3dsmax and pats themselves on the back for being excellent designers

Design is not how it looks but how it works

You want to propose a better solution Be my guest Apple wanted to keep Face Id and you cant hide Face Id behind the screen like you can a normal camera So they did the best they can and the results are excellent If it wasnt for the cutout that space wouldve been wasted anyway for paddingmargin in the notification What better way to use it than have the cutout there

Its a perfect solution"
Change a few words and youre criticizing the virtual keyboard on Jobs first iPhone
Good design is always about compromise
Cant argue with fanboys can ya Its shocking to see how fast they already swallowed the pill
Wow the Dynamic Island really hurt you bad man
I mean it makes the flaw less egregious Ive refused to get a phone with a notch for all these years but if tech like this becomes the norm on other phones not an Apple user but I cant deny their influence I could see myself biting the bullet
US pricing is wo tax but other markets getting a price hike is a game Apple can play because of the strong dollar
I dont know its around 1320 maybe its the price US is paying with all the taxes too
Exchange rate
this wasnt live tho
Especially since they have moved to USB C a for so many of their other devices
The problem is the battery barely lasts half a day Maybe it might be better to pay for a battery swap
ipads too
"They promised manufacturers 10 years This is year 10  

Between that and the EU law coming into effect iPhone 14 is the last iPhone with lightning"
Even the Macs charge at 65w
Still not even close to justifying a 25 price increase for the base models For and outdated processor For no 120Hz For 128GB base storage Basically the smallest amount of improvements ever For 25 higher price Excuse me WHAT
And That price increase  you mentioned was already applied to iPhones around the globe import taxes etc what we are talking here is about the fact that Apple didnt increase the price of the iPhone in the US but increased 200 euros in the base model here which was already 200 dollars more expensive than in the states so basically they are discriminating against anybody else but the US This is utter BS
So I have poor education a divided country mass shootings and delusion for a living No thanks
Static Peninsula
Underrated comment
Single purpose peninsula
Pedantic peninsula
it makes no sense i know crazy
"Apple fan boys This is absolutely incredible

Eh"
I have the 13 mini but man that nock got me thinking about the Apple Card This whole event has got me on the edge
Same I have a 6s and desperately need to upgrade Might as well get the 14 pro since I probably wont upgrade again for 6 years
Thanks Obama Putin
Im in the US
"Thats the Apple tax on EU regulations  
Enjoy"
Following on Sonys footsteps with the recent global increase of PS5 prices except in US
Well yeah duh We fucked up our economy so it just makes sense now to even things out
Thats top of the line laptop right there
I will keep my 11 Pro with its non dynamic continent of a notch until it stops receiving updates Paying anything above 1k for a smartphone is ridiculous
Verdient Da geht noch was Soll der Plebs mal in die Tasche greifen fr sein armseliges Statussymbol
Yeah and mmwave 5G the other year
" the satellite service will initially be available only in the US and Canada

Initially"
Literally every year
Thats not due to Brexit Euro has done the same thing Its recession fears pumping the dollar
Euro only has further to fall All the recession fears keep spurning the USD up up and away
Yeah you just drag the notch down like bugs bunny Youll love it
Just turn phone upside down D
Oh fuck I didnt think about the reachability feature Its gonna ruin apples mirage Hopefully they dont remove that feature
Idk its not really replacing anything like the touch bar was just making use of something that would otherwise be dead space
I remember when apple moved the URL bar to the bottom of the phone on safari and so many people were disgusted  I was like what you really want to keep stretching all the way to the top of your big dumb phone
MINiPhone
Like the island always on is only on the 14 pro It will not happen on the other 14s nor any older devices since the screens arent capable of it without draining battery too much
AoD isnt coming to older models nor 14 for sure Thats reserved for 14 Pro only
"Theyre not Older iPhones cannot drop the refresh rate to 1 Hz 

The 13 Pros can go from 10 Hz to 120 Hz when needed but not lower"
Most likely the exact way its handled on X  13 on iOS beta
" To be honest that was a typo I originally had something else and forgot to erase the the

Whoops"
So when the Euro rebounds Apple will lower the price of iPhones in Europe
I seriously dont understand how they managed to make a pill camera cutout so goddamn sexy I usually just laugh at typical Apple nonsense like this but goddamn
"Still confused as to why people are impressed with this Another gimmick like the small screen on the Mac book

No notch would have been more interesting"
In the past Id just land buy a sim at the airport and go on my way Might have to research eSIM global carriers or something Pretty hard for me to explain eSIM in Vietnamese
"Space gray is now just black gold looks
 pale the silver is too white and purple isnt for everyone

Blue or green would have been great"
Thats the color I wanted 
The camera bump still shows through the case though
We lose our sim cards tho 
To me thats the biggest issue tbh 15k for a 14PM 128GB its insane Ill keep my 13PM 256Gb for the next few years but this price hike its scary af
Having a floating single dot like my Pixel makes more sense than the little notch for it But having that little useless little sliver of screen above it seems so odd vs integrating the new feature into a dynamic peninsula
Which photos are you comparing to The stock iphone 14 pro images seem to be the exact same color as the iphone 13 pro images
Didnt the software have to adapt to the notch that was there before Whats the difference here
I was in the same boat as cheeseybacon11  at work  Read up on island and still didnt get what the hype was about It NEEDS to be seen
Rightunless you are watching a videowhere its even more hideous
So they put a pill shape around the camera hole that empties as the timer runs down Sounds cool Ill have to find the video later
"The no sim slot is going to be a problem for a lot of people I think Especially people who travel a lot or swap between phones I recently got a new phone and swapping the esim was a huge hassle Couldnt just transfer the plan because its tied to the phones IMEI so I had to go to a local store to have them deactivate the sim on my old phone then go home and reactivate my plan on the new phone I cant imagine what its gonna be like for anyone who swaps phones a lot or travels a lot and just buys a local prepaid sim for wherever they are rather than pay exorbitant roaming prices

Unless the carriers or Apple has found some way to make swapping an esim as easy as swapping a physical sim its going to be a real exercise in frustration for a lot of people Like a throwback to the old CDMA days where you couldnt do anything until you took a trip to the phone store"
I would even count that as a negative for Europe aswell No esim  less convenient and might mean less water resistant
Canada peak iPhone with a SIM and satellite SOS
Yeah apple themself in their presentation clearly stated only us  canada
I didnt Because I dont live in the US 
I would buy that in a heartbeat
I would switch from Android to iPhone just for that Id use Lightning and would have stopped complaining about USBC if they made that a reality
This would be a day 1 buy I wanted a 12 Pro Mini but they didnt have one so I settled for a 12 Pro
"Im actually thinking the mini might not be as dead as first imagined They seem to be keeping the 13 Mini in the lineup and with the iPhone 14 not getting a new CPU and just getting some new camera stuff and the satellite feature  maybe they just cant fit it yet and will bring it back next year when they can miniaturize things further

I guess I might just be being wishful but Im surprised they didnt kill the 13 Mini entirely"
Honestly it would sell me Give me a phone that actually has the good cameras in that mini size and Ill upgrade in a heartbeat I have never liked the Pro or Pro Max size phones I would even pay more for it
Yeah Im not saying its below the screen Not sure what the actual terminology is so inscreen camera seemed better than saying anything else
Depends on how you mean There is no active display pixels on top of it no But its enclaved in the display
"I think theres a difference between the attention to detail that Apple consistently provides and the innovation of hardware and features that Samsung have become known for I think the general consumer takes notice of this attention to detail and then sticks with Apple even if some features are lacking compared to some Android manufacturers thus making Apple more successful Just my opinion

And for the record I dont think folding phones are a gimmick at all and I would probably own a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold if it werent for my overreliance on the Apple ecosystem and a bad experience with a previously owned Android phone"
You forgot VAT which will bring it up to about 1040
"Isnt the US price ex VAT

Maybe well get that 5 VAT cut"
Seriously mind boggling
Like before
"My X with 64Gb was 1150 5 years ago 150 more is not that bad given how screwed inflation and exchange rate is at the moment 

Honestly it shouldnt matter at all when buying such a phone"
Add 20 VAT to the 999  so more accurately 1199 means 1329 in France apparently
And most 45 out of 50 US states have a 47 sales tax which is not included in the US price So most US buyers will pay an extra 40 to 70 in tax which pretty much covers that 47 delta
Your money was worth a lot more at the time the pound is weaker now
Weird that New ipads use USBC Seems like they should just abandon the Lightning now Silly to have 2 chargers for the ecosystem
I know but thats just it MacBooks and iPads have USBC why not the iphone Lets go with an environmental side keeping the lighting cable is causing more pollution One cable for all USBC and be done Saves the environment even more
Doesnt it interfere with proximity sensor and IR blaster
"Marketing aside

You are right The glass is still more durable its always a trade off between shatter and scratch resistance Glass is glass and glass breaks adding another layer of glass or commonly plastic protector is pretty pointless messes up the colors the feel of the screen and the adhesive typically destroys the oleophobic coating

1000 phone and youre ruining the best part with sticking 20 screen protector on it"
We have always had the same  as  Due to the exchange rate we always pay more but now we are paying exxxxxtra more
So European prices increased while VAT has been the same in each country
Damn the 30 USB speeds was a rumor I was least expecting to be false Where did you find out about this Nvm I see it now on gsmarena
Pretty sure theres some new hardware additions to make it work
Its stupid Its a basic safety feature that should be available to everyone but between spending 400 after a tradein on a new iPhone or 700 on a satellite phone one is clearly the better deal
It is a change they will start to add a lot of control and buttons there which will make it so hard to use without a second hand instead they could make them as notifications on the bottom since now notifications are shown at the bottom when phone locked would be so much comfortable but the thinking more about gimmicks than comfortable use
"The main purpose of Dynamic Island is to mask the presence of the TrueDepth camera system that still needs to be there to allow for FaceTime calls selfies and Face ID Apple just made a clever choice to merge software as part of the solution to hide it

Thats why its at the top of the display 

So unless youre suggesting they moved the TrueDepth camera to the bottom of the phone even worse from a UI perspective just because its closer to your fingers  your complaint isnt really a valid one

Also ever heard of the Reachability feature"
It sounded like it was using the same API as the live events functionality which bundles it with functionality everyone will have in iOS 16 increasing the likelihood it will be utilized
Garbage color choices this year
The gold hasnt looked nice after the xs imo
I felt colours where getting better for the pro range then this I really want to upgrade but dont want any of these colours but also the specs of the 13 pro arnt fantastic so Im really torn
Thanks but when can I buy it
Not in Europe Price increase of several hundreds
for me
VAT was taken into account with the previous price of 1049 I know about changes in currency but did not expect to see such a big increase when the USA price was kept the same
What model do you currently have
"I know some people will call me crazy too but 22000 trade in on the 11 and the price is not going to be as bad as I was prepared for 

I havent really been excited for a new phone in a while but 48mp camera and legit new interface has me pretty excited for this thing"
"I think the main practical aspect is that it should allow you receive notifications and such in a less intrusive manner 

Mostly I think and most of the other comments I have seen just think it is neat way to utilize the space occupied by the cutout If it has to be there why not do something cool with it"
"I saw the video but didnt immediately understand what they were doing  
So they are selling taking away screen area as a feature lol"
Interesting thats the exact same reason Im not gonna be upgrading my 12 pro max Every device I use has usbC apple or not Other than 
"Literally every day Also theres many more uses than charging that usbc is superior for especially for me since I work in video production

Not to mention the fact that as soon as usbc iPhones come out your need to upgrade to a new phone will be sooner as more adapters switch off lightning Youre not gonna want a lightning cable phone two years after they switch"
Yeah Ive had that since my iPhone XR
This guy in 2 years Ill wait for the iPhone 17 instead
"To be honest beyond the camera what did this update really do that will change the iPhone experience drastically Nothing People were expecting 8K video with the upgraded camera and that didnt even happen 

The dynamic island is cool but nothing that is significant Its a cool software aspect  hardware wise theres nothing significant really for the average user 

Apple couldve done equally impressive ui interaction features in older iPhones that would be equally as impressive as the dynamic islands animations This upgrade would at least be more convincing if they added USBC

Everyone is tired of a better camera being the main feature upgrade It seems like every year half the keynote focuses on the camera"
Not hard to make the screen bright when they have 200 ppp less than everyone else
And then the camera lens has fingerprint
No notch I mean Im no Tim Cook but reckon thats what OP means
"A friends xiaomi mi mix 4 doesnt have one it has a camera under the display

My moms 300 oneplus has a tiny hole on the side of the screen can barely notice it

My fathers asus zenfone 8 has a camera that flips out automatically which means you can take selfies with the main cameras"
"They are fucking Apple  
Before they came up with the iPhone I could not imagine anything like it  
Find something out  

The other one the Lightning port is clear cut cashgrab at this point They use USB C on the iPads there is no reason not to put it on the iPhone other than royalty fees after the lightning cables  

I also find the 61 too big for the mid size variant  

Loosing the SIM tray also means that I cant dual sim whitout esim meaning I cant use my company number in it  

14 pro is not a bad phone but it is not enough an upgrade for me over the 11 pro to justify buying it and also it is a downgrade in some areas"
"I think your scope is kind of limited ALL US carriers on postpaid have esim but when it gets to prepaid it is not the case One such big case is Verizon their prepaid doesnt have Esim support 

Im a person who has a physical sim plus Esim for data I know you can have two esims

Your second assumption is wrong it wont have a problem as long as you use the carriers roaming which might not be the cheapest The moment you decide to use another local carrier then youd might be out of luck"
You can have 2 eSims which is not enough
Yea thats a good point articles are saying due to inflation UK prices are up 150 on average but god like the standard iPhone 14 now starts at 850 which is 979 USDlol
Yea dont get me started about bloody vat lol should be way lower
You do know that VAT was before too with previous models and now prices increased
Just in the US other countries have sim tray
"Because when you travel to another country you will have to get an esim Getting an esim can be quite frustrating and require a special trip to the actual carrier store instead of just picking up a sim card from practically any grocery store

Many carriers require you to activate your plan with a regular sim before swapping it out for an esim An esim is great if you are in one place and your plan is a long term one but for travellers who need a short term prepaid number and data the time and effort it takes to get an esim installed and activated is a lot

If youve ever had a CDMA phone and travelled youll know exactly what Im talking about most people in that camp just brought a GSM phone with them so they wouldnt have to deal with the frustration So a lot of them are gonna end up having to carry multiple devices again"
In my opinion we are still 34 years away from a totally portless iphone I think it is totally possible they stick with Lightning for 3 years and then go portless
Thanks for the info I ordered a case off Amazon that says will fit the 14 pro so well see if thats true
And how many eSim can I add Two Three would be ideal
"It does now The line up is

	iPhone 14 61
	iPhone 14 Plus 67
	iPhone 14 Pro 61
	iPhone 14 Pro Max 67

The one that is MIA is an iPhone 14 Mini I guess the form factor wasnt selling enough across the last two generations to justify its continuation unless the next SE is basically a Mini"
iPhone 14 plus doesnt exist
Oh yeah iOS16 is coming out on the 12th
"On iOS devices you cant see the music folder at all only itunes on PC and a Mac can see it and you cant just drop anything in there only mp3 and AAC files plus they will be added to that music manager library

Worse for ringtones

You can install whatever browser you want but all of them use the safari engine because apple doesnt allow any other browser enginebackend to be used"
Unfortunately some redditors dont have as much cash as others my man
What I mean is do I need to turn that ProRAW setting on for 48MP to be used or will the main camera just use it as standard from normal photos What happens if I zoom in Will it then switch to 12MP
Bro that upgrade is totally suitable and useful for you but I mean the others that probably never need that feature
Thanks MKBHD mentioned that brand as well Might look into a new charging brick from them
It was a tradeup because that was cheaper upfront than repairing my camera
Talking more about doing it in software no need to actually make a pill hole punch lol
"s21 ultra gang

but Im here for a good old fashioned tech fight"
Its a nice way to turn an unfortunate necessity into a feature
cant believe all the people circle jerking about it
"Thats the problem with every tech nowdays
The best thing is buy it and dont look at new products till you want a new one"
Yes I think so I had the 12 I dropped down to nonpro which I will never do again got the 13 Pro and it is pretty much near perfect IMO I need to see the purple better but I might go Black I like how it looked
Okay as long as theres an option to view content without a giant hole Im good Last iPhone was 6s so I havent been around notchesor even no headphone jack
My 11 Pro is 58 i think
The 11 pro was 58 inches Right in between the 13 mini and the standard
The 120hz is a real game changer tho
Interesting there were rumors that the 13 had the hardware but lacked the satellite business partner but I havent heard anything about them enabling the feature on those phones Its also possible that the inflight airplane wifi allowed for emergency calling even without paying for a connection
Dont need to They dont have any of that ugly black space
My Android doesnt have a notch
I have a tiny punch hole in the topleft of my screen  no need
The tiny punchhole on the screen of most androids lights up whatever color you want already for notifications Has for years Apples copying android as per usual
Its the opposite now Android is ahead of the game
"Copy what exactly

Android has had notifications with actions for years Its cute that you think this is new"
Its called widgets and I can make customizable size and interactive ones with weather audible app that opens gates spotify use time I have 1 homescreen decked out with the weather from 10 different cities
Okay but android users arent wetting their undies for it
Apple people like to be liked for their stuff
Yeah I cant believe how many people are eating this shit up lmao
terrible implementation though You lose the quick glance visual element
Its not on the iPhone Pros theyre actively showing
httpsiimgurcomsTHe45Tjpg
They did with iOS 16
Canada model retain SIM card slot httpsiimgurcomuzR6QHHjpg
Dont confuse outsiders with logic and facts They hate that
Lol lighten up
spanish accent Doesnt sound russian at all
Pretty sure its South American  hispanic The way he said seinsor sounds very Brazillian I loved his accent reminded me of my brothers Brazillian exgf
This right here
The nonAmerican version keeps the SIM slot and the American version didnt get any price increase
"Its just motion graphics using negative space It doesnt matter if the start object is a pill shape or a circle the black pill graphic can expand out from the start obiect without any issues

Its cute and clever Not ingenious or revolutionary

Android already has apps that show a colored animated ring around the camera cutout to signal notifications so there probably will be several pill notifications apps in the playstore before the first 14 pro ships out"
"They typically follow Apple trends 

I could see them at least trying to add some dynamic elements around the hole punches they use"
Ill be sure to tell that to my power bank and CarPlay adapter
Why Im not buying an iPhone outside the US
Dang  sorry dude
I mean I see your point but I think most people would also do well to realize they dont need to upgrade phone every year if the changes arent substantial enough to warrant it It feels a lot better changing every 35 generations to get a mostly new experience than every year and just get an incremental upgrade on something you already have
Rip thanks for answering
Sure its not a big problem but I think its not a significantly better solution than the notch
"No because its the physical change of the camera and notch At least thats what I assume 

Cant imagine they would add it to the previous ones as they probably want something that exclusive to the new notch and to boost what little changes were made to the new phones Like with the MacBook Pro touchbar"
No Im saying the little space between the north and the top of the screen if they moved the pill up just a bit
"No like getting a feature that turns the camera intrusion into a dynamic fluid positive addition to UI rather than a weakness to be mitigated like Android had for years

Im not even sure Id want AoD I didnt want it for my watch why the phone Tapping it is so quick already but we"
How are you liking foldables Think anyone could do professional art on them
Well crash detection is something that is ready for years now This is my opinion IthttpsopinionIts also bad that the camera still remains at 12 MP
"Are you saying I wont be able to hide text above the floating island

Man I had this troll thing planned out"
"Also Notification Center requires a topdown swipe as well 

There are always going to be people that will complain and nitpick about everything and assume that everyone else uses the phone the way they do"
I know but they still have plenty of time My guess with the 15 or 16 there will be a redesign of the phone itself and then they introduce USB C as some new feature or something like this
Yep On the other hand androids notifications management is so much better it doesnt need gimmicks like this
Why not just not touch the camera its not like there will be anything shown on the lens to interact with its not in the center and theres plenty of other space on that pill to touch
exactly
They installed a camera youve been able to get in almost any other flagship phone for 2 years now Yes the company that keeps releasing rehashes of their devices with miniscule upgrades when they claim to be innovators of the industry is a dogshit company
No it isnt What
Why do you love something that makes it harder to used the phone seriously these sheeps not you dont take it the wrong way I love their phones Its super premium I also have an m1 max 16 for my design work But lets not become a sheep
I typically wipe my camera on my shirt before i start taking serious photos with it
You already would touch it pulling down the Notification Center though
"Not a hater  I own an iPhone 8

I wanted this to be the year to upgrade but Apple still havent added a significant feature since the 8

No most people who buy iPhones are not artists photographers or film directors so no most people could care less about the camera  Seriously take a picture of someone 5 feet away with an iPhone 8 and the iPhone 14 and honestly tell me if there is even a moderate quality difference  Sure if you digitally zoom in to a specific area of a persons face and because of the oled screen that zoomed in shoot might have a moderate color quality increase but why would you do that  Most people only care if you take a picture a few feet away and it looks lifelike  My iPhone 8 does that just fine

Most people that buy smartphones are general users that want to be able to check the time calendar social media posts email and text messages while being able to make phone calls listen to music and watch YouTube videos

General users benefit most from streamlined better battery life and useful new technological features  

No Apple doesnt want to bang out new important features every year or even every other year because its less profit for them  Milk the current feature set as long as they can is their modus operandi  You think that some small Chinese company can make phones with notch less screens with cameras underneath and Apple with all their resources cant

Of course they can and already have  They are just sitting on it until they Need to release it to get back market share lost in the meantime"
Sidenote by downvoting my comment you guys are proving me right
I like his video but very recently he is very biased towards Apple Its high time Apple could have opted for typeC 48MP main cam and high refresh rate screen for all models None was discussedmentioned by him
"How old are you Grow up 
There is nothing wrong with being excited about something and expressing that excitement in a figurative manner"
Fair but the Android I have does and I really love it Its the main deterrent for me atm That and lightning port
"60 to 120 is a drastic difference

120 to 144 is barely noticeable To call it abysmal is insane lol"
Oh are iPhones 120hz I didnt realize that Thats not a bad difference
Uhhh what
"Brightest iPhone display ever 2000 nits maximum

Is this sustained or only during few seconds when you only watch HDR"
Well it was either this or the google pixel coming next month so no iPhone for at least the next 45 years
Ohhh nice I never realised many people were still jailbreaking to be honest Do you not have issues with apps being blocked I remember years back when I used to jailbreak my bank always seemed to detect jailbreaks and blocked access even with tweaks which supposedly hid it from apps
Dynamic headfuck
Hello friend I heard that you can hook me up with a soul phone
Its my opinion I can have those cant I
anytime u mention it applefans whip out the whataboutism like the subject is android cause yall ram out of excuses
What did the 14 do better than the X
If youre a child sure
No it appeared on All
Has a physical one at least it looks like it from the picture Seems like some of em dont but only in the US Guessing it will be if you buy the phone with a phone carrier maybe even locking that phone specifically to just one carrier
ive never preordered anything so this might be a stupid question but i can use my existing carrier right
Im taking about the apple store
Sorry I must have slipped past it
You can do better than that I believe in you
Thank you
I didnt even know those were a thing Gonna check some out now thanks
Thats what I figure too Ill ask when I go in store
IOS looks like it finally got a notification bar thats on the top of the screen Theyre advertising it as a revolutionary innovation Its just like what android has had for a decade I dont get it
My guess is WiFi 6E adoption is pretty darn low I havent seen the need to upgrade my AC3000 mesh network Why should most people bother honestly
Yeah I didnt know that I even looked around their page for dates or anything indicating what would change after new iPhone and didnt find anything Was literally waiting until today to order it since I assumed price would drop 
Ok All the pics make it look like the cutout is gone Like the speaker is under the glass
Ahh I think the same but this pill drives me crazy and I become wanting it so heavy
"You do realize that the notch is also used to house the frontfacing camera right Not just the IR scanner used for FaceID but also actual cameras used for visible light photography

You and I might not be the biggest fans of selfies but theyre nevertheless really popular among the majority of people and until cameras can be embedded under the display with minimal reduction in image quality the notch isnt going away

Existing phones with underdisplay cameras all suffer from the same general dip in image quality usually resulting in blurry images particularly when taken in the direction of a light source and the part of the screen that lies above the camera also tends have reduced pixel density or similar which makes it stand out in direct sunlight"
Is the battery better they mentioned any percentages
You know I thought it was cool but I hadnt thought of swapping them on the regular  I do it too
Me too 
"I expect the camera improvements would get more people over the line

Yup I think the dynamic island is cool and all but Id never upgrade only one iteration if not for the fact that camera has twice the number of megapixels as my DSLR Probably still not gonna do it but its an actual consideration"
"You are right

 I use One Plus now

They make fantastic tech for reasonable prices"
"I tend to agree but with a certain degree of reservation  
I think that Apple innovative or potential has some troublesome relationship with their finance department   
Instead of going almost allin in a given year and creating a significant upgrade and facing high expectations the following year they instead rather stretching and milking that cash flow cow over a period of 23 years  
This year its the island notch and next year they will probably rumble about finally using to USB C   
I mean what really stopped them from implanting that technology this year They already included that on the iPad Pro AirPods and MacBook are all USB C for a several years now so why to stick to a USB 2 technology while having they flagship phones record a 4k video in the heavy ProRes codec now on iPhone 14 pro a 8k video  


Unlike microwaves and cars computers keep evolving and there are quite few different categories and with VR AR and ongoing evolution computers and their accessories do keep evolving   


Smartphones especially iPhone is somewhat stuck and Apple take micro steps of innovation"
"The satellite feature is only available in US for time being  
And I suspect that the esim card is more a marketing strategy that technological one as esimcards are still unavailable in many countries   
For installer there is an average of 15 price difference between Europe to US and therefore there are quite a lot of people who given the chance  rather purchase it in US  
So it might be away to force them purchasing the the new gen iPhone back in their local markets"
"How much would it go up to even with the taxes 
The price in India i noticed an asterisk on top of it so I think it could be higher than that"
No I mean I hate the 2016 screen bar and so did everyone which is why they removed it What lessons were learned
He must keep a brick of cocaine in his desk drawer
Except tricking us with the iPad update for so so long already
Seriously He hasnt fixed shit for years dude I left Apollo because of it

Apollo update Now with an island that is dynamic
Well find out in a couple of weeks
Dont you want to know if someone left an angry response to your comment at all times
Maybe a little envelope icon when you get a message or when you get a reminder to check a thread again
As far as Im aware Spotify has complete control over making their app work natively with HomePod Deezer and Pandora have it I imagine there is a cost or something but it is a weird hill for Spotify to die on
"ITS FULLY IN SPOTIFYS CONTROL JOIN THE FIGHT BROTHER

httpscommunityspotifycomt5LiveIdeasiOSImplementNativeHomePodSupportidip4985214httpscommunityspotifycomt5LiveIdeasiOSImplementNativeHomePodSupportidip4985214"
I hardly use my HomePod because of how limited it is But if it worked with Spotify Id probably use it more
nuts i have 3 in my home that get used everyday especially on cleaning days and all 3 are playing in sync its a whole concert also fun to use the intercom as a PA system
Youve got a very weird sense of what to be sure about
Its just album art and status same as the now playing notification Probably a minimal change for developers using the native APIs already
"Look Ive been building software for over 20 years and Ive had this conversation a thousand times You want to focus on this ONE THING and you think it should be REALLY EASY and it seems dumb that they dont JUST DO IT 

And when you zoom in on any one single feature or enhancement it always seems this way How hard could it be Just do it

But the reality is they probably have a list of 300 things that they could be working on and we have no reason whatsoever to believe that this dynamic island bullshit is more important than any of those 299 other things A few weeks for a few devs is not trivial That could make a lot of things happen 

If you want to sound like you know what youre talking about acknowledge that they have priorities and tell me why this should be at the top Dont pull a work estimate out of your ass and pound your fist on the table about your ONE THING they should JUST DO Ive heard a thousand idiot customers  managers  users rant about their ONE THING and sure it seems like an obvious win if you first blind yourself to everything else in the world"
Least entitled Apple user
shawwtayyyyy
Shit on Deborahs desk 
"Im on a phone Im on a phone Take a good hard look at the mothefuckin phone
 

Apple missed a huge marketing opportunity here"
I feel less alone and more a part of the hive mind right now
 Im in my flippy floppies 
And I threw it on the GROUND
You have received a text message from  AND I THREW IT ON THE GROUND
  the Nina the Pinta the Santa Maria
The champs is crrriisssppp
GROUND
DUH
Santana DVX
Imagine the names that goat cut
They were planting chips at night
Its mostly visual and notch is not touch sensitive I guess
because money
Money
No Is about the hardware too Redesigned cameras and software
The A16 chip has better antialiasing that makes the transitions smoother so I guess its technically tied to A16 devices
what devices still have a notch
You really gotta ask this Always on display is also software and guess who only gets it
they mentioned a new antialiasing driver in the SoC that will help with the fluidity of animations exclusive to the dynamic island
"Its purely software right Like theres no special hardware driving this feature

Yeah its just a different shaped notch that Apple expands or contracts the black pill shape around it to make it look like its dynamic

Why werent all devices given this sort of notch functionality

Because iPhones have barely changed in the last 5 years and they need something to be different about the latest and biggest cash grab"
Thats a very minor trade off if at all I think
So just wipe it away when you want to take a selfie I smudge even my back cameras and dont see the difference in photos honestly
It appears that the buttons you have to touch are placed away from the camera The space is tight so it will depend on the users finger
Maybe dont touch the camera If they are smart they will keep button interaction off the camera From the videos it showed animations not really around the camera but more left and right of it Also I think the direct middle of the cutout is more a proximity sensor so shouldnt matter if that gets touched
Not a big deal Everyone has a shirt they can clean it off with
My guy these are touchscreen phones Smudges have always been a thing lol
I have to wipe the cheeto dust and pocket lint off my cameras already before taking a photo if anything this will keep my cameras cleaner since Im touching it more often
Well the camera itself isnt touch sensitive yYou dont have to touch on the camera itself to use it so it shouldnt get too smudged
Just wipe it on your shirt
Ive used Android for a very long time and I liked it but I havent seen something like this on Android I had the Samsung S10 plus with a pill camera and all it does is light up around it when activated If you mean those ugly floating bubble notification they arent even close
Its only certain notifications It doesnt replace the notification tray
literally toast notifications
The whole iPhone is essentially a Touch Bar though compared to the actual Touch Bar that was on a laptop keyboard  Totally different
"It was presented extremely well in the keynote Lots of animation things sliding in an out interactive bubbles that pop in and out from the side Its one of those things that looks meh in pictures but exciting when you see it in motion

Obviously nobody should upgrade their phone just for this feature Its not a makeorbreak But its that type of fun apple UI that we like so much"
Yea i do not understand how this is different from banners Its just banners w a new skin
"I think Im missing something because it just sounds like notification realestate centered around the new Notch Hole

Everyone else here seems really really excited and it doesnt sound like people are joking either"
You understand the current one gets covered in prints constantly right from being picked up and moved around constantly or well talked on a phone call its a non issue
Except the island doesnt pull down its a tap control
Revisit this in like 3 years I bet the Dynamic Island will have been an iconic Apple design that everyone will be copying going forward
Honestly looks impressive I didnt realize why they were messing with it after shrinking the notch last year and not doing anything with the extra space This seems useful
My thoughts exactly Saw the leaks knew the pill was coming but watching the announcement I audibly said to myself wow thats really cool This is coming from an avid Android user waiting to switch one day Not quite there but the dynamic island name aside is really cool UX
where are you seeing it all the links Im seeing arent explaining shit here and Im wondering what the fuck a dynamic island is supposed to be
"It just abstracts away from its nature so much that its a bit silly

Dynamic Notch is so much clearer to the layman"
I mean dont they already Mine is covered in thumbprints
Justdont Its not invisible
Probably yeah Shouldnt be a huge deal though unless your hands are normally greased to hell
Dynamic Island is kinda corny tbh Marketing speech to make something sound fancier than it is Its just adding a bit of flair for cutout people Thats doesnt sound quite as elegant though
"A little of a and a little of b

Notches and cutouts arent going away any time soon on most phones so we might as well make them useful"
It works its just not anywhere near the quality of a camera that isnt obscured by pixels Its not a big deal for some like me where its on the inner screen of the Fold 3 but enough people love selfies to give pause to Apple deploying it
But they already have a product called the Pill
people will still call it a pill dynamic island is harder to typespeak
I mean dynamic notch would have been better imo No need to use the word pill
Idk dude I think I prefer what they did with this than what they did with the notch  maybe not a true feature but its certainly the most useful version of the camera hole in a smartphone
Normal What would you have called it
Bro what It is a feature Its the definition of dynamic too
I mean it is a feature when no other phones currently have anything like it
Yeah thats a good point Ill keep my current phone for another year
Not what we understand to be under display camera but ok Apple name it whatever you want
RIP innovation then Sad sad day
Complete gimmick and this essentially solves the underdisplay problem without actually putting the camera under the display
Thats why I said it Its pretty bad
We shall see but the iPhone S implementation has gone far enough 12 13 14 look too similar Under the hood improvements can only go far specialty when your average user doesnt really care about that
I use it but its 5050 that it works first try Anyhow android and specifically Samsung OneUI do one handed and gestures much better Ill stick with Apple for now as the watch is leagues ahead of everyone else and doesnt work well without an iPhone with your sim
Im loving their slow jam Deep Fusion myself
feat 3D Touch
"Retina Display is an oldie but goodie 

Especially the aged like milk claim that it was the highest resolution visible to the human eye"
I prefer the bside Always On
That is the most Appley name of all of them
Id imagine it will be as it is currently with the notch Standard 43 aspect ratio videos will extend to the edge of the island whereas zoomed in or 169 video will extend past the island to the border of the screen
They did this in the original iPhone X launch materials too I think they want to be honest about the notch and also get the new shape burned into your brain
Yup My Pixel 6a uses the status bar pretty well  notifications of apps with recent notifications as well as the timecell signalbatteryetc more icons than on iOS  Ive seen Bluetooth location battery and percentage wifi cell signal DND Its fine I cant complain but I really like the dynamic features of Dynamic Island Also I feel like I should point out my Pixel just has a hole punch rather than a pill so its still like 95 of a full status bar rather than like 70
maybe if theymake it cool enough people will stop covering their selfie cameras with tape
"use of space that has otherwise been pretty useless 

LOL it would be much more useful if it were a gasp full screen Making it more useful is just putting lipstick on a compromised pig"
Its called honest marketing why wouldnt you want to see it with a video playing stretched
it doesnt interact with content the content incorporates the black hole in the display in its design to make it look less distracting genius work by the ui styling team tho
But what about when you fullscreen video Then it is just big black dot
"So it shows you a notification at the top of your screen


So innovative"
We dont want it to be cool We want the notch to be eliminated not made normalized in order for it to stick around for another few more years
so a notification bar
"So notification banners that are by default smaller than the screen width

This isnt new or innovative Its just a way to make the notch look like its more at home on the phone"
Sounds like a load of BS
Seems like it is what the touchbar on Macbook Pros wishes it was
Isnt it always dead space just sometimes dead space with some content next to it The sensors are still there theyre not putting a screen over them
"The dead space is always dead they just make some content show up next to it against a black background

Its the right place to put those sorts of notifications and everything looks nice because Apple of course so theres nothing wrong with it but I dont see why everyones creaming their pants about it"
I think the name is trying to make it sound like it has to be an island even though it would be fine with the notch
Youre corny
Isnt this just software though Couldnt they do this with older models
He means other OS
Apple internal devs are not the same as external devs
Does it It sounds like a protein powder to me
Norm for android too as they all copy apple
Yeah how dare they not add touch sensors to the notch in older models I was all ready to drive to the apple store and get the upgrade Damn them
Distance your thumb needs to make
"I swear theyve been saying that for years but my iPhones always die after 4 hours of actual heavy use

On my motorcycle maps  screen my iPhone 12 loses like a single  every minute"
Ok and what about the 14 pros
Theyll release another colour next year they did it this year with the green
same here Blue is my favorite color and I really wanted a blue 14 Pro Max
I upgraded to the 11 with Pacific Blue Its soooo nice And because the phone is doing Just Fine and they havent released a blue thats remotely like it Im totally content to just sit here watching incremental improvements year after year until something pushes me
Currently still have whatever the blue was called on the 1212 Pro Still my favorite
"Color it yourself its 1000 You better be using a case

Edit replied to the wrong person somehow"
What iPhone do you have
I dont really need a new phone but if they drop a green colour in March again Im ordering that shit
Im moving from my XR to the black 14 Pro Max
Boring black Im trying to like the purple but its just not appealing to me
I imagine blue and green are just more popular colors than purple Thats probably why
I shrieked when I saw this shade I often use charcoal w a tinge of purple vs using true black in my designs Whoever at apple who chose this deep purple I fucking love you
Purple loves you You love purple Youre a happy family
Thats ridiculous
The green is an amazing color
Yeah I dont need to upgrade so if there isnt an option I like Ill just wait
" Edit I had no idea there were so many caseless monsters out there yall are wild

At this point cameras are so huge that even if you have a case on the color is going to be fairly prominent"
the green color is the only reason i was looking to upgrade this year
Im actually thinking about keeping my 12 Pro Max because I love the blue color so much I figured Id upgrade but Im so put off by the new color options
Of course The blue and green shades are perfect Hope they bring those back
Clear cases exist
I spent a lot of money on my phone I want to look at it
With AppleCare why bother with a case
Sure Considering how really honestly improvements yearoveryear are often pretty marginal its not like older devices are going to get left in the dust anyway
I went without a case for the first few months with my 12 pro max because of Apple Care I use one now but only use clear ones lol
I get clearfrosty cases just to be able to see the phone But I usually go with frosty because even the higher end clear cases will eventually yellow
Im keeping my blue 13 mini over the 14 pro because of the colors
Crazy I usually just tell them whatever color they have in stock is fine because Im putting a case on it before I leave the store
yup ive kept my british racing green 11 Pro Max around waiting for another green one at launch and even with the 13 Pro Max coming out with green this year I just chose to wait for the 14 Pro Max soon as the purple leaks came out I was sold
I specifically got the 12 over the 12 Pro 2 years ago because I liked the shade of blue better That was a larger factor for me than losing the telephoto lens 2 years later I do not regret my decision
I havnt used a case on any iPhone ever except in certain circumstances where I use a case for a day or two then take it off again
Ive got a clear case and made the wallpaper the color of my phone haha
My hot pink corvette is totally masculine
They could also keep the idea of the dynamic island around just built entirely in software Its not there to hide the camera anymore but its still useful besides that Having the entire thing be screen could allow them to add some color instead of requiring the background to always be black and add more content in the area that is currently dead space
They cant make progress too quick else they wouldnt have filler products to fill
Not made conceptualized probably
The problem actually is that those behindscreen cameras still take pretty bad pictures well below the quality of the existing iPhone frontfacing camera Apples not going to downgrade that picture quality
All of them are also poor in quality theres always a haze over images and some doubling effects
There is but it was very bad for the camera quality None of it actually manages to capture a good photo using it The tech is definitely not usable on a mainstream device yet
The behind screen cameras take awful photos
literally what Those still look like shit and you can still see the outline of the camera Iirc the most recent one has to use so much computingmachine learning to fix the shot making it now viable quite yet imo
Exactly For Apple there is a lot more tech than just a camera in the Face ID module so even if they could fit the ordinary selfie camera under the screen theyd have to do it with the dot projector the flood illuminator and the infrared camera too
The behind the screen cameras take extremely poor pictures and you can still clearly see the camera through the screen It looks cheap I dont think Apple would to that
camera modules need space You cant really shove it into the bezels
"People care about the quality Both for the sensors and the camera

Googles facial recognition has recently been in the news for basically anyone being able to unlock it"
The quality of the camera is the single most important feature of a smartphone for a huge number of people Especially for a phone that is marketed as Pro Apple spends 70 of their iPhone events talking about the camera for a reason
Youll eat it and like it
"To me the camera isnt cutting into the display but the display is expanding into the bezel 

If Apple got rid of the notch it would make the display smaller not bigger Because theyd just increase the size of the top bezel and move the screen down 

Which you could argue is a better look for sure although I personally dont think so But it definitely isnt making the screen smaller than it would be otherwise"
"vs a phone with huge bezels If youre get extra screen youre getting extra screen

edit and most videos are still 169 which wont interfere with the notchhole punch anyways"
TouchID doesnt take selfies
"You suppose I need every single feature as soon as its available I dont I need it when its done well and thoughtfully 

Under screen camera Cool tech Worse than an iPhone 

Foldable phone Cool tech Ugly ass line I cant ever unsee"
Except that photos from front cam on z fold 4 looks like its 2010
Enjoy your ugly crease in the middle
Oh and its made from such crap material that you can scratch it permanently by touching it the wrong way But enjoy your tablet thats aspect ratio is incompatible with any media service ever I guess LOL
That hinge will forever make me uneasy My favorite foldable is Microsofts
Who cares
My phones screen isnt fucked up beyond repair after accidentally touching it with a fucking finger nail Get off your high horse
"Yeah Ill be honest I dont understand how this is supposed to be a feature or at all appealing

Yay the obstruction gets bigger sometimes"
I came to Reddit this morning to laugh with others about this problem that Apple have rebranded as a feature but everyone loves it maaaaaan Im confused
This should be a casestudy in those criticalthinking classes where the prof shows how by simply representing the same concept differently ppl would have a complete different view of it Like literally nothing about this socalled genius new feature that doesnt exist before but with a different name and accosiating with different thing the notch now its a whole innovation
Yeah lol its still very much an obstruction Its amazing how well marketing can flip the script Whats more is that they could add these same notifications to the non pro easily But they wont because then it wont look quite as nice
Yeah the reason people disliked the notch was because it took up a lot of space that can be used for notification icons The island doesnt look like it can display more than one piece of content at a time so now youve still got the same issue of lack of real estate space just with a sports score or timer sitting there instead of a blank space Slightly better but not exactly a fix
"What The iPhone doesnt just have a hole punch because Face ID is a separate larger sensor 

And they didnt just put animations around it it shows information and can pop into a mini app overtop of your current one"
I mean that absolutely did happen I remember people making those jokes about mine but this notch is just window dressing on something unsightly
No The last time Apple had a notch all the other phones just moved their UI even though we didnt have am ugly useless notch It looked awful
I wish
Lol keep waiting Maybe in 2030
Uh am I crazy or am I actually typing this on iPad Apollo
Literally 11 same color lol Amazing job on the app btw glad you got the recognition last Apple keynote over Reddits official one
I always get a little excited when I see your name show up in purple What a fun little Easter egg Looking forward to the magic you do with the new stuff
Oh damn I use your app Thank you
Yeah I think you have to now
Cant wait to see a post from you showing off your new purple iPhone and your username below the photo all colormatched
this is the biggest alpha move i have ever seen from a developer tbh
Neat
I kinda feel them tho
Any first thoughts on how Apollo could interact with the island feature set
"Oke thank you for your response 
 
For the others it was just a joke of course I dont expect it to be ready on release date"
"Software features almost never leak  Hardware changes have to go through so many different people that can potentially leak things particularly at thirdparty companies Apple uses for manufacturing  Thats why we knew the phone would have a pill instead of a notch

Software features are only seen by a much smaller subset of Apple employees"
I guess manufacturing molds that show us the shape are easy to leak from low level parts on the supply chain But the software is so much more tightly controlled around only the people that need to know Its harder to leak
It did leak There was already some stuff online showing how they were going to have a pill and also a hole punch and they were going to use the space between for functionality
Nearly at all Weve seen pictures of the bubbling island but it was completely misinterpreted as a separation between the camera the small bubble and the Face ID system in the larger one So yeah the pictures were out at least a few months back but we had no idea what it was Cant wait for the android folk to copy it all into their system as we know 100 itll happen
Nice how they embraced the notch limitation and actually made good use of it
Its sick that you can physically tap on the notch whoever thought of that deserves a raise I was worried youd only be able to tap around it
youre going to love it
Yep The unveiling of dynamic island had vibes I havent seen from an Apple event in a long while Its very very clever UI solving multiple problems
"Lol I feel ya

Edit apparently the base pro model is 999 thats pretty surprising Objectively high but for apple surprisingly not"
"dude I feel that one

our last one was 412 normally around 160 or so"
Im so glad the weather finally cooling down because the air conditioners have inflated my bill
Soon youll be able to afford the phone but wont be able to afford the electricity to charge it
"energy bill

What do you need energy for Just sleep bro"
Yeah I agree its tiring watching the new phone reveal and its just the same phone
Was all for getting a 13 PM on clearance but damn is the 14 PM so tempting
I mean I dont mind being an unwitting advertiser for something I think is cool
What phone has this
It was genius tbh Its just a simple things that was left unnoticed by others thats what makes it genius
Theyre pretty gimmicky Apple nailed it
"Tough to go under display with an ir dot projector ir flood light ir camera and color camera 

That little pill gotta fit a lot"
"Lets hope the UX team smash this and it doesnt turn into something they discard looking at you Macbook touch bar

I really like the touch bar on the macbook Im bummed its no longer on their computers It was really useful for quick commands Took me a while to get used to it but once I did I was hooked"
I agree that Android devices wont suddenly get more pronounced cutouts and are rapidly heading towards no cutouts but I bet Android will be redesigning their status bar to have some of this showy functionality
"I think the touch bar failure was due to it being in a place where you have to take your eyes off the screen and a lack of 3rd party adoption and not a whole ton of super justifiable use cases There was just no reason to use it so no reason to keep it

Without even looking at the UX Id expect this to stick around Its in a virtually unused spot where youre looking all the time its just a simple ui replacement for existing UI elements and I think 3rd partys will find some good uses for it

Id expect this to stick around until the phone loses the pill and even then Id expect a similar element to replace it"
Theyre literally serving two different consumers now Ill take a pinhole and in screen fingerprint reader every single day over FaceID
"Yep this to a T 

I still remember when everyone raged against apple for AirPods Oh those earbuds look dumb as hell I would never wear that Ill never ditch my wired headphones 

Now every single company and 80 of people in public has wireless earbuds And so many of them look 10x worse than AirPods Some of them look like you shoved a lollipop in your ear Some look like you have horns coming out of your head 

Im convinced that non apple people will just always instinctively hate whatever apple does until the android version comes out 6 months later at which point they act like androids always did that"
"I just have to get through the next 34 weeks and the temptation to upgrade will be gone Im also holding out for usbc

Im more tempted by the AirPods"
"I personally dont mind not having usb C
But incase Im not aware other than the transfer speeds and charging perhaps idc abt fast charging what other use cases does usb c have
I dont mind the extra cable too since I use a single cable to charge 3 iOS devices 
What am I missing"
Usbc plus periscope telephoto
I did think they could add it to the notch but just a few animations without ability to interact with it to place information on there and having to design for a whole different size of notch etc  it would be doubling the work for a sub standard experience imo
Sports scores on the lock screen are what Im looking forward to
What about for dating apps
I wonder if theyll manage to fit all the twenty formula 1 drivers during a race within the notch
"Youre talking about a few pixels which wouldnt be utilised in any meaningful way had it been moved up

That gap is clearly being used to provide breathing space around the dynamic islandhttpsiimgurcom4qydoiepng which is not wasted Youll also see that matches the dock spacing from the edge

The current hardware is also dictating the positionhttpsiimgurcomaGfzIpfpng

Overall the gains vastly outweigh any negatives from supposed wasted space What would you gain anyway Half a line of text on a web page 10 pixels of a 900 pixel tall image hmm

update In actual fact youre gaining space from the thinner borders The 14 Pro has a resolution of 2556x1179 vs the 13 Pro at 2532x1170 The 14 Pro Max is 2796x1290 vs 2778x1284 on the 13 Pro Max"
And were going to love it
Well at least turn the old one into apple for recycling Not shaming Id probably buy it too if I wasnt happy with my 12 but these things have an environmental impact Enjoy the notch
"You calls everyone sheep 

Also you upgrades his Galaxy Fold yearly despite absolutely no changes in the fold whatsoever 


Surely you see the irony in this"
I dont like the internal camera personally You just replace a notch with an area that looks like dead pixels
Weve had notifications coming in from the top forever before we even had a notch
Agree A notch is a peninsula not an island 
Oh you meant to say you wanted the island Ok then
Its a cutout
Stop trying to make notch happen
We cant wait for you to get your hands on it
Windows phones were amazing phones Its too bad they didnt catch up
Microsoft imo was ahead of the game with features and services but did a terrible job at sellingmarketing them Zune had a music streaming service Windows phone was cool and had a lot of cool features that people like now Apple proves that marketing is really the key to consumer buyin
Yeah thats out of the question information wise Windows Phone was the absolute king Android and iOS are still catching up
Windows phones were amazing I has one Metro was fantastic I still dont understand why they couldnt find a niche
Fckin Cortana was able to read on my car my incoming messages and I could dictate her what to respond natively
"Microsoft has always been full of people who have amazing ideas and a lot of their concepts end up being ahead of their time Windows Vista Windows Phone etc

Its just that middle management and the people who make decisions arent the talented ones they dont really seem to understand anything the developers and designers are trying to do So we end up with botched releases and cancelled products with potential"
MS probably shouldnt have sat on their asses while blackberry was leading They could have made the Windows phone the iPhone
"I was a hardcore Windows Phone user tried a lot of Android gadgets since but iOS15 has been the closest to that experience Microsoft had a lot of great ideas around that time they just REALLY sucked at marketing and product management 
Im also still angry about killing the Xbox One Kinect it was an exceptional device and just imagine what it could be capable of in a modern smart home"
Yesss love seeing more of the bouncy jiggly UI stuff I feel like all we had was the jiggling apps from the beginning of iOS until now with DYNAMIC ISLAND Where android has implemented the bounce stretch rubber band effect everywhere
I loved Force Touch
Sure but its annoying when they dont have to be due to hardware
They did nothing is my point haha
Not wrong though Only apple came up with this
"Well sure I guess  but Jony also designed the hardware

So either way he chose to make things less fun for the sake of design purity"
I feel like the latest design language with no bevels or frills kind of does away with that whimsy The Apple Watch ultra is the latest example of the new extremely utilitarian design but you can see it in the new MacBook Pro and iPhone too
httpswwwredditcomrmaccomments91sc36ijustnoticedtheiconforwindowscomputersin
Why dont they sell a phone without a front facing camera Who needs those Im ugly anyway
lol yup
From what Ive read its not as much along the camera under the screen possible as much as it is to make their standard of camera quality of camera under a screen possible
Youre still interacting with the notification bar like usual except now it supports tapping rather than sliding down motion It ultimately depends on how you want to describe interactive because its basically the same thing as the notch but now the oled screen plays animations for notifications and widgets below and around it to make it feel more interactive but its nothing that wouldnt be currently possible via software they just did a good job utilizing the small amount of extra screen real estate Unless I missed something its all just software and I think people are trying to point that out Some people are already asking if you can move it aroundwhich is why people are probably irritated
Same but hesitant because holding out for one more year for potential USBC iPhone might be a good move too
"Its because the chip is barely better or even more efficient The battery life is only better in one metric on device video playback 23 vs 22 hours

Wish it had more RAM Tired of apps closing so often and especially if the camera is used Makes it feel like an iPhone six when I have to sign back into my hbo user after snapping a quick photo

I do like a lot about it though Im just more apt to point out whats missing"
I mean be that as it may for the average person that will be even more beneficial than a comparison from the 13
It absolutely does If it was anything else they would be hyping that up beyond belief That is over triple what any phone can do rihht now
1300 for the pro here in Germany
and USBC  
They really shouldve moved to wifi 6E though
Good for you i cant airdrop to Windows and even the Files App if it actually has access to that app is only working like 40 of the time
Dang I had completely forgotten about that What a wild story
"I mean the hardware is accurate The phone has a pill and a hole punch with screen in between it Its just that the section of screen is always black except for the camera and mic indicators 

The leaks were all about hardware and they were spot on"
Then it can imitate the island when needed and not when not needed like full screen videos
Yeah I think moving Face ID under the display wont kill the dynamic island it will just make it even more dynamic Youd lose the dead space in the middle so you could fit more content or have a different background color But I think the idea of some sort of persistent notificationupdatemessage tray at the top of the display is a concept that wont go away
"I have a strong feeling that the Dynamic Island will eventually come to Mac OS and will possibly be a big part of Reality OS 

Apple is letting machine learning guess at what you want from your phone at all times now I imagine theyll want to hone this in before making various ARVR elements that do the same"
"Underscreen sensors particularly cameras are not easy to do The few phones out there with it have significantly worse picture quality in certain conditions and never better 

Also its cheaper not to try and customers keep buying regardless"
"I think thats highly debatable The island is a slick software solution to a problem Android phones dont have needing a way to show dynamic notification content why they already do through the status bar and needing to hide a giant camera cutout virtually all Android phones have small pinhole cutouts for their cameras 

Apple certainly did it prettier but idk about better Id rather not have a giant black hole in my screen even if they do make it fun with sports scores or whatever"
"And a little ring would circle it when you opened the camera app 

The smudging of the camera would be a concern of mine"
But they definitely havent found a way to make the space useful like Apple has here
The point is how the hardware pill interacts with the software not that there are notification icons
 12 year account deleted because fuck uspez How can you have one of the most popular websites and still not be profitable By sucking ass as CEO Then to resort to shitting on users and developers who helped make the site great because youre an insecure techbro moron Im out You can do the same with PowerDeleteSuite 
I want to see how the smudging will affect faceid
Same as with the Macbooks The camera is right in the spot where you put your finger to open the lid Lens is always smudged
You mean the Palm Pre and webOS
Ask Siri
"I think the issue with the iPad is that you can use it in any orientation So sometimes your notch or Dynamic Island could be upside down or on its side And that doesnt really work If youre going to have a camera cutout it only really works when its integrated into the status bar 

Which actually makes me wonder how apple is planning on using the dynamic island when your iPhone is in landscape mode because this would have the same issue"
Well they did already put the proximity sensors under the display for the 14 Pro this year Im not saying that means they plan to put all of them under it in the future but they may continue the trend and put more of them on a later phone
I wouldnt say the was interface designed around just the notch but it was also designed around no home button Reducing the amount of physical operations
"Think about how difficult this is for Android phone manufacturers They cant design a good interface to really work around a notch or hole punch because Google has to do the design work for them

Thats not true at all Android OEMs have control over the software and they can design it in any way they like If you compare a Samsung a Xiaomi and a Pixel their user interfaces are vastly different

However Android phones dont need working around a notch because there isnt one its just a camera cutout or its super small as wide as the camera is which lets the phone have a full size notification bar"
I mean the vision was always going to be an uninterrupted full screen device So yes the notchpill was always a stop gap to that
Dynamic island
Seems like its a calling attention to it and b misleading people who think the camera is now under the screen or something lol
"Yeah looking at the pill as a button was a very very clever insight

And if and when display tech improves and they can do away with the pill its just that many more pixels to use for animation Its a very clean solution to optimize for the pill and also future proof the UX"
to be fair its a genius use of the punch hole cut out but it IS also one of the biggest punch hole cut outs Ive ever seen
"Kinda disappointing others didnt work on this Whole industry of UX designers and no one did anything with the notch

Soon all the android would copy this feature"
Yea what a weird criticism I dont think they thought that through very well
except its not its the biggest punch hole cut out ive seen in any phone i love what they did with it but it still looks super gross every time nothing is happening up there because its just a big black emptiness staring back at you
Right but people seem to think the pill area is interactive but its not
iPhone 14 Pro Max 128 GB is 1449  in Germany Insane
The Euro dropped 20 and US prices dont include taxes
What is the reason for the price hike only in europe
Youd probably get a return flight from Ireland here to the states on sale with aerlingus for 350 euro at the right time It could be at times potentially as cheap then to go over and buy it
The US prices are missing taxes
It is save yourself now
At least you get to keep the SIM card
Dont forget that the US prices they always show dont include VAT while EU prices always do
Not nearly as much as the apple EU tax has grown
The dip is only temporary EURUSD will come back to normal after the EU solves the gas crisis which it will Apple just decided to offload the currency exchange risk onto the customers knowing they have the cash flow and reserves to make it far less painful without losing even a cent
We would have had higher prices in that case as well Why is the EU 20 more expensive by default before taxes
They did before too Still price increased several hundreds
Is it time to let 2015s 16GB iPhone 6s out of jail
"Or its more than adequate to download some music podcasts and games for those times you wont be able to connect to the internet and stream  offload photos

1380 euro Poland Hello Nice  Too expensive
Look at your current storage usage and judge your upgrade off of that I was surprised to find Ive used 100128 and I have a lot of pictures and videos In fact most of my storage is used by apps caching weirdly Podcasts was using 20 GB and I dont listen to that many
"A 13 Pro can currently be purchased for 12290 NOK launch price

The 14 Pro will cost 13990 NOK

Good idea If I were you Id leave Vienna and never come back lol
"US version might not work in eu because the us version is eSIM only and uses different frequencies afaik

Its essentially Androids inline notification music control  rich notifications but done MUCH better
Yeah i agree They cant engineer out the space so they have to work around it
"Maybe it turns off on lowpower mode and I assume also when the device is facedown or in a pocket and for bedtime mode

It would be extremely surprising if it was just on in perpetuity"
"Woah this is way way off  Maybe a few percent over the course of a day in real world usage from a really old galaxy s7 A recent Samsung or pixel is probably less

Currently I charge my iPhone 12Pro twice a week in normal use so a 5hour discharge for AOD would seriously suck if it cant be toggled off
"Background app refresh and location services are two powerhungry things you should turn off to preserve battery

Also push email Disable that and set it to check for email every hour instead and you save a lot of battery

As for refresh rate Its OLED it needs power to display something by lighting up the LEDs refresh rate is only part of it"
Its an OLED display just displaying something other than black means that the LED pixels produce light and that consumes power Refresh rate doesnt factor into this
Thats what I meant they havent gone down in Europe
I missed it Did they confirm 120hz
Same here especially since Apple wont replace my battery since it glitched and still says 100 health after three years
They have thishttpswwwapplecomusedushopproductMJWY3AMAmagsafebatterypackfnodec7a2921d41451c746ae62feab6833ae0b035970f5a762875b0b666df3a543699d8a96a894fa9ccdae135180ead5a444a7c7f3714dd931e56a86c1dc45781b99cbc11640a115df05ffbc78fc90a2ef9b8cf9379a9fca71f87cb537664499f2e48 which is the next best thing
" Since we skipped the 13s last year

There hasnt been an S since the XS so Im pretty sure that moniker is dead for the time being"
" 5G support

Literally worth nothing

 MagSafe

Another gimmick

 Promotion AOD

Ah yes these two are good things


  Dynamic Island

These are just new notifications with a hole punch xd Their marketing really brainwash people

 way better camera and battery life

Eee just a bit better 12 series had worse battery life than 11"
Using the right to demonstrate for an excess profit tax for example Other countries are doing it already
this
yeah but when the  was super strong we were not getting cheaper prices  were getting ripped off now
No wonder Android market share here in Brazil is at 79 while iOS is at 21 2021

"People working outside using their phone not that crazy 

If you are outside in direct sunlight for a few hours and not in shade how would it dictate when to activate if it wasnt on all the time under a bright outdoor setting Assuming you dont place it inside of a dimmer area"
Id argue that Samsung displays are always as good obviously the iPhone 14 pro is using newer screen tech than the 6 month old S22 but the S23 will likely edge out the then 6 month old iPhone 14
What do you mean
Ah I see well better late than never

"We think youre gonna love it

I mean I get WANTING that much storage space but like wtf are you doing on your phone that you need 1 full TB of storage I do photography and do some onthefly editing with my phone when necessary but Ive barely pushed 100GB of space needed Im not trying to justify the price but Im legitimately curious what one needs with 1TB of storage on their phone for
Euro is roughly the same value as a dollar and 45 taxes would be insane
Does the euro price include vat
Dynamic Island Cloth 3999
Lots of stuff they dont mention until consumer explores it
Euro to USD has tanked in the last year Korean Won to Euro has remained stable
Euro has declined against USD a lot in last year Apple prices their products relative to USD in other countries
Euro has reached parity with the dollar after its fall Majority of Apples expenses are in  so they raise prices to match
I have no clue but I know the base price is the same
Maybe just blame russia like every other fucking liar
Yea but without updating it this year the writing is on the wall Personally if they sold a mini pro phone that is what Id buy
With the raging inflation and upcoming energy bills Apple might need to hike up the profit to the absolute maximum Some people will buy it no matter the cost but this fall and winter I suspect a lot of folks will hold on tight to their money
12 Pro was 999 but 1179 here in Finland when it came out 14 Pro is also 999 but 1349 here
Knowing Im going to be in apple event recording for the world to see would also keep me up at night Some people are better at handling stuff than others I envy those people because I am not one of them
Probably still nervous knowing hes being filmed for millions to see
Yeah my MacBook and mini 6 are both type C I really dont understand why the newest iphone wouldnt be Even my 20 aftermarket Switch controller is type c It cant be a cost thing can it
Absolutely get the battery swap I truly think USBC is worth the wait and youre not missing a whole lot from the 12 13 or 14 Pros in everyday use I think you should hold strong
Chargers too
Base iPad still uses lightning but your point stands
"Its entirely strategic

Most business classes will teach this

Create a nofrills entry level product which serves the purpose only to push the consumer to purchase the more premium version that has a higher profit margin

Apples highest margin iPhones are their Pro line phones 

With global smartphone shipments declining this is how they encourage upgraders to lean toward their higher margin products

They can actually increase the purchase price per device by enacting this strategy and sell less phones in a saturated smartphone global market while simultaneously increasing their bottom line

Its all about Apples shareholders as a publicly traded company The companys stock value is directly tied to its quarterly sales numbers Apple offsetting a decline in phones shipped with an increase in the average price paid per device keeps the stock price afloat

This year the huge differentiation between the normal 14 and 14 Pro is so significant that most people buying their phones on a payment plan will simply opt for the more expensive devices"
Euros and pounds are in the toilet compared to the dollar honestly surprised it wasnt higher in Euros
"Discriminating against everybody else but the US

Are you actually being serious SMH"
It should work my friends US 13 Pro works with an Airtel Esim
Yes all the 3 major carriers support eSIM in India You can even have dualtriple eSIMs loaded from Airtel Vi and Jio and switch between them as desired
"Mhm poor education Thats why we have all the most innovative companies

Oh and Europe is fucking king of divided countries what are you on about

What country are you from again"
This is the one
Oh wow thats crazy youre still rocking a 6s Im on the 10 and its not holding up too well anymore
Naw its because your forcing the to USBC
There was no mmWave spectrum awarded to carriers last year in EU didnt make sense to deliver a mmWavecapable phone here
Thats all folks
The problem wasnt them moving the URL bar it was literally everything else Some of the betas were so bad
I love the new URL placement I also use a Mini however so I guess Im biased towards one handed designs
OLED displays can handle always on no problem
They most likely wont one a price is set it stays It goes both ways the 14 and 16 macbook pros are actually cheaper now in europe because they have not increased in price in line with the euro devaluation Apple will just keep this price and then adjust it again with the next model depending on exchange rates when that one comes out
"Possibly although they wont while its volatile but they could in 6 months if things have recovered

They dont want to get into the habit of changing prices often people buy phones now because they know the price probably wont drop and theres never a sale"
They wont change the price between launches unless theres an extreme change in the fx rate But yes generally theyve moved international prices both up and down with the exchange rate
"No notch is not technologically possible 

This is a good way to transition"

Screen down for me No problems but I do take really good care of my phones
Its depressing seeing how many people are defending this or downvoting anyone who thinks its bad Not every move is a winner
On the website at the part where it shows the device at a 34 front angle You can see that the stainless steel band is a darker grey than Graphite
No Im talking more about the notifications and the live activities a feature in ios16 Its like a popup that utilizes the island by enlarging it in a way and shows information from a specific app ie music app I cannot really explain it that well but thats mostly the point
Its not just like moving stuff around it its literally utilizing it as an interface by having it be the notification area  It dynamically changes shape and size to whatever notification it is Its hard to describe but it looks incredibly well done like it almost makes the pill cutout look like a feature lmao
No the notch before was just dead space On the 14 pro it is dynamic and they turned it into a UX feature instead of just dead space
You just made up a whole scenario lol Its just the pill shape and then theyre basically making the pill wider with added info in it
Nah it just shows a little digital countdown clock But definitely watch the video it is pretty slick to see in motion
Yeah so NZ prices with taxes werent so different last year Tf you surprised about
"Im betting theyre keeping the 13 mini just because it gives everyone the size option if they wanted after all the difference between the regular 14 and the 13 is minuscule

I agree with bringing it back in the future Probably in a different brand like an SE Apple did initially make the SE as an option for those who wanted a small form factor with flagship specs at a small price a return to that branding would be really nice"
It is an inscreen camera literally a camera in a screen Not sure what that person is talking about they must be thinking of an under display camera
I will give credit where it is due Apple is definitely ahead from competition when it comes to ecosystem cross software integration and now the silicon as well The ecosystem is imo apples biggest strength and what deters most people from switching to other brands On the other side of the spectrum this deters me from being invested into Apple products because if i am tied into an ecosystem because then its apple shopping me more than me shopping products from so much out there I like the feeling of being fully free and have whatever brand for anything I want Anyway my point is that apple is at a point the market now where it doesnt need to innovate on hardware side of things and it can just keep refining its software and keep hold of the market By the time foldable tech underscreen cameras etc gets mature apple will then implement them in their products Hence other brands also do the heavy lifting and pretty much refining the new tech  to make it usable for others
Indeed  1 is currently 1 so it is definitely more expensive for us Europeans
The fuck UK peeps have to pay 20 tax on all electronics VAT
I bought it about three months ago
"Why  They have more than that

Pretty common for the past 30 years or more"
Why not just convert everything to lightning
not at all ive been using an edge to edge screen protector that covers the face id camera since the iphone x and never had any issues
Nope
Just turn on your strava app  Boom done deal
"I guess I see it as additive and optional I dont see how its taking anything away 

Im not sure putting it at the bottom works as well While easier to reach Your eyes arent drawn to it like the top  Only time will tell I guess"
Really I didnt know the purpose of the island s The whole point is they cant move it to the bottom Hence bad design Dont make our thumbs try to reach unnatural spots Its like just leave the pill cutout as is Clever choice my ass lmao
Sorry I misread pre orders begin this Friday
Looks like all export taxes and tariff have gone to based on the other comments
Yea its due to how badly the UK Pound has done against the US Dollar
11
Yep Went on the Apple site and did the trade in review and I thought for the price why not I am not a fan of Face ID but it doesnt look like it is going away so holding out for Touch ID now seems fruitless
If by taking away screen area you mean using it to show contextual info like directions timers music call info or other things you have running in the background then yes
USBc still requires different types of wattage with cables and power bricks
Depends how you use it my XS does half a day unless Im babying it
Change the iPhone experience from a 13 Pro Maybe not But who is buying a new phone every year This is such a tired argument when you know damn well the average person is upgrading every 23 years at the earliest
iPhone already has the best video on a phone
You forgot PURPLE
"I mean maybe But idk my iPhone is unbelievably oleophobic It literally picks up zero fingerprints unless my hands are greasy which I try and avoid anyways Worst case scenario you take three seconds and wipe your screen on your shirt before you take a selfie 


Unless you have perpetually dirty fingers and are taking selfies at multiple different times every day I just dont see that being a big deal at all"
Interesting that Verizon prepaid doesnt offer it I use Visible as my primary carrier a prepaid subsidiary of Verizon and they offer eSIM capabilities
The value has gone down for European countries as well
"Thats true probably to do with the pound doing terrible against the dollar atm imo

I was just pointing it out because its misleading to compare the cost of something with the tax to something without any tax"
I mean I get that but a 6 is obsolete now theres so many other options that would still be affordable
"By default the main camera will use quad pixel binning to sample down from the 48mp to a higher quality 12mp equivalent with less noise There is also the ability to zoom to the center 12mp of the sensor for a 2x equivalent optical zoom with no image degradation

And then finally if you want the full 48mp you can choose to shoot in their raw format or use a dedicated app"
But the keynotes 
It definitely is but since I skipped it with the 13p its not like its a sudden need with the 14p and if thats what I wanted the most Id get the 13p instead anyways
Possibly but never seen it before so who knows n
They have been ahead for quite some time
Typical Apple anything it touches is innovative even if it already existed for years and years
Im ashamed for apple that they feel compelled to go to these lengths
Yeah Im in the US so I was mentioning that they specifically did say in the US for the no tray
Youre going to love it
Switching it off gives you the quick glance Then with a slightly longer glance swipe down you get the percentage
Yeah cause its not on by default Im running iOS 16 and have it turned on right now Its there
Well you need to enable it I think At least I have my battery percentage on my 11 Pro
Its off by default I also think you and others might overestimate the number of people who want this
why did it take this long lmao but Im glad they did that
My bad Shouldve clarified the US market
Vitor Silva he is from Brazil
The opposite can also be said considering the other big feature apple was advertising is an AOD a feature samsung has had since the S7 which was released 6 years ago
Are you joking Ive worked in telecom for long time and apple are hardly innovators If anything features you see on new Android phones show up on iPhones 23 years later while they convince you lemmings they created it lol
They already did The S10 from years ago has a ring around the punch hole that you can customize The color the motion and size for different notifications
yeah but the price hike is real Anywhere outside of the US
"I mean I dont upgrade every year usually every 23 years as I am an iOS software engineer 

I was pretty hyped to go from a 12 Mini to a 14 Pro but honestly Im going to skip this generation 

They could have at least added USBC for platform unification 

At least with the iPhone X we got a redesign  amazing new display  FaceID  Revamped UX  Better everything overall 

Comparing when I had an X to the 14 Pro realistically there is nothing near as game changing over including iPhone XS  iPhone 14 Pro beyond the ESIM which was long overdue and a better camera Sure the phone is faster dont get me wrong which is amazing but apple hasnt done anything significantly game changing in the iPhone for a while now 

Its a mature technology so I get it but it just seems like a trillion dollar company should be able to do more

The 14 Pro was 100 stunted in development to save major updates for next years 3 year design cycle"
yep one more year with my 7 Plus or im switchting early next year to android waiting for that samsung announcement
Lmfao okay dude AoD is insanely useful people love it and apple fanbois will think its so innovative now that they have it and use it for a while
"foldables are great i just used my Fold4 on a trip and it was great Ive had every Fold from the original and both Surface Duos Im just locked into the Apple ecosystem so my main is still an iphone but i would 100 pay for a 2500 iPhone fold 

i definitely think you can do art on itbut im no artist so I dont know what it would take to be professional There is a slight gap in the digitizer between the fold so it may cause some unevenness when drawing across the crease Ive never noticed a problem but i just take handwritten notes sometimes never draw"
"Its your opinion that theyve had crash detection ready for years You have absolutely no evidence No rumours You just decided that oh well obviously theyve had that since 2017 or whatever

Not sure how seriously I should take the opinion of someone who has somehow missed the new 48 MP camera"
Yeah the island is unmovable Basically the notch is smaller but the area around it is bigger I see it as a bit of a downgrade
Why isnt it then higher up if that area is not for use Quite thick band between it and the edge of the screen
"You must not work in the industry They have industry leading SOCs and the camera system matched Id not beats the current competition

Just slapping a 48MP sensor is not enough these days to make a great photo A top of the line SOC is needed for the software to adapt the raw pixel data"
You can have a nice house all you want in Bumfuck USA but youre still a broke boyo if you dont have an iPhone
You wont buy it and no one really cares that youre not going to but Im willing to bet around 100mil others will buy it Soooo yeah I think youre quite stupid pal
"It is do you think theres a hole on the screen or what

Im not saying that therere pixels above the island

I mean that a screen protector wont need a hole just like with the notch iPhones"
What a great way to tell everyone else in the thread you just got schooled Using an 8 year olds come back
"It doesnt make the phone harder to use at all Im already used to swiping from the top for both control center and the notification shade

Its a very clever way of integrating something that for some is a negative the pill and turn it into something fun 

Both iOS and Android have gotten to the point that the hardware and software is so good theres not much left to do in this form factor So stuff like dynamic island is something I love"
" No most people who buy iPhones are not artists photographers or film directors so no most people could care less about the camera

You think I was talking about artists I was talking about parents the newly married people building their first house and people going on holidays

 Seriously take a picture of someone 5 feet away with an iPhone 8 and the iPhone 14 and honestly tell me if there is even a moderate quality difference

In bright sunlight Nope In dim light especially with a moving target Absolutely I see it every time my daughter does something worth photographing in the evening or at night

Milk the current feature set as long as they can is their modus operandi
 
Perhaps but Im not sure how much I should trust the insight of someone who neglected to consider family photography as a use for the camera

You think that some small Chinese company can make phones with notch less screens with cameras underneath and Apple with all their resources cant

Yes thats correct

No one else sells as many high end phones as Apple nor nearly as many of the same model phone plus or minus a couple of features By phone model sales Apple had the number one number two and number three spots last year plus another model at five or six or something Apple cannot add a new technology until the supply yield speed of production and cost are all viable at a larger scale than anyone else has to deal with Your Chinese company can probably add a periscope camera to their 600000 units because supply and production can be slow but Apple would not be able to do the same for their two hundred and something million devices"
I understand in which case but OP I was responding to clearly lives in the US hence their comment is still non sense
Crying
Thats why I figured the s wasnt needed
Wrong comment my bad 
It activates under bright sunny outdoor conditions when the phone is in use
Theres jailbreak bypass tweaks just for that I use liberty or liberty lite or abypass No issues whatsoever Actually I can do so much more on my phone
Shrug If you like
Screen battery camera speakers etc
But still took the time to scroll through comments and reply to them
Im sure I heard them specifically say the SIM card tray is completely gone in the US Im sure theyll have it outside of the US where adoption of eSim isnt quite there yet
yes you can preorder thru your carriers site too
You can trade in your current iPhone right in the Apple Store yes
You could also wait on some firstimpressions If there a UK reviewer at the event they might ask this
Deleted because Reddit API
"Well ac3000 router supports 400 mbps on 24 ghz band Many people have internet speed more than that Like for me I have 1 gbps but then most of times gadgets love to settle on 24 ghz which would max out at 400 and wasting the remaining 600 
Just like people prefer 5 ghz for faster Speed the same purpose is served by 6ghz with much more higher speed 

Rather 6ghz is congestion free so its best to have wireless backhaul on 6ghz band rather than a 5 And any mobile connected to 6ghz band of wifi 6e just blasts through the cieling in terms of speed 

All it needed was change of antenna but apple decided to remain on wifi 6 for xyz reasons 

I am on iphone 12 pro so yes this upgrade is good for me but I seriously doubt going from 13 pro to 14 pro Wifi 6e would have made much more sense

Hope they dont launch wifi 6e when wifi 7 launches"
"Yeah they dont do that because the previous gen pro would be so much more enticing than the current year normal phone especially this year And they dont broadcast it because they want you right where you are right now 

If you can wait it out until the new year refurbished models may start showing up Or try your hand at the secondary market"
Sorry I was confused I dont consider a notch just being a camera hole cutout But maybe Im wrong in that I do think though if the iphone used fingerprint instead of faceid it would look cleaner like the Samsung galaxy
Oh yes actually 23 and 26 hours of battery I think Up from 19 and 22 I think
"I mean what really stopped them from implanting that technology this year 

Scale

No one else sells as many high end phones as Apple nor as many of plus or minus a couple of features the same model phone Apple cannot add a new technology until the supply yield and cost are all viable at a larger scale than anyone else has to deal with"
Hi I would like to work for the Apollo dev
Have I been doing it wrong this whole time for my career s
"I did try it I didnt care for it

Different strokes for different folks"
"Can you drop a link Im not finding it

EDIT har har jokes on me this is a fucking Android app"
"isnt rif android exclusive and apollo ios exclusive

Boost for reddit is superior to rif imho"
Hes already replied in the above comments Hes excited for the possibilities
"httpsiimgurcomfra2e6cjpg
Id agree but I love how he is further down being as excited"
Thanks for the reminder Its about time for a trip to the tip jar
Hes been working very hard on the iPad update for 3 years
A RESTful API p
haha this is exactly what I think every time someone posts the smallest change or update for Apollo Its neverending Its an incredible app one of the best but I hope Christian is able to take vacations
Be careful what you wish for 
"Really  Apollo barely changed since he released it barely any new feature of Reddit are implemented and bugs arent fixed quickly

But hey there is new icons "
What happened there
"AlienBlue was the app Reddit wished theyd made so they bought it and killed it

Apollo is the app that immediately filled that void arguably even better Reddit must haaaaate Apollo"
Ok Im aware of it and use it just wasnt expecting it to be used as a reference like this I guess its popular
RiF essentially is the reddit design reddit originally had and the best
Would you please share the app link Ive never heard of this Wanna give it a try
"Youre absolutely right I was wrong It seems more apropos for Apple to hinder support for a competitor  

Im frankly appalled at this discovery I wonder if Id use my HomePods more if Spotify was natively supported"
it took forever for apple music to be fully compatible with google
 Im just being sarcastic I have no clue what apple will do
Yep Im actually more anxious for everyone to get on board with apples live activities notification philosophy Would really help to cut down on sports notifications which I use heavily
"Lols as someone in the industry as well youre 100 correct Were all overworked and constantly needing to prioritize whats important 

Heck I can barely prioritize my core workload much less smaller things that are cool but not critical

Smaller things get relegated to the bottom of the priority list especially non essential features that amount to a cool gimmick"
"A few weeks for a few devs at a company as large as Spotify is absolutely trivial At any given time they have considerably more development resources committed to features thatll never ship and bugfixes that wont actually fix anything And whatever features they do ship are also pretty minor Spotify is a very mature product From the users perspective it hasnt fundamentally changed in a long time

If youre in the middle of some stiff competition with Apple Music like Spotify is this is an important feature to include You want your product to integrate well with the users experience You want your product to feel more premium and responsive than the competition This is why Apple is gobbling up smartphone marketshare in the US Theres no excuse not to integrate a feature like this when you have the resources that Spotify has"
"SHAWD 

Acura"
Like a bawsss
I just had sex
Peralta WHAT are you DOING
Thats awesome Actually lold
I took that brand new iPhone 14 Pro and threw it on the ground Im not part of your network
Im not a part of this system
httpsyoutubeQwEmj71KEzo 358 it is touch sensitive
"It absolutely is  just try tapping it to scroll to the top it works every time for me

EDIT a better way of saying it its good enough for taptoscroll it could react differently with a UI designed around it

I think the reason is simply that while technically possible to do something its too big to anything interesting either on the animation front or on functionality  theres no room on the sides of the status bar to add any new actions"
It seems like they said it was and showed a tap on it
I think you mean pressure sensitive
14 standard will come with the notch along with the a15 bionic Only the Pro series are getting the a16 and Dynamic Island
Doesnt the always on display rely on the 1Hz refresh rate to save battery
 What are you even on about
"Thats pure marketing speech AntiAliasing is where you blend neighbouring pixels to smooth any jagged edges on lines and text Commonly used in video games It has nothing to do with animation fluidity
As a technically savvy person that term greatly confused me"
Until the smudges start messing up faceid
Apple out here excluding the nudist colonies
r
Not sure about samsung as they roll their own version of android When you get a new message a notification floats up like an island from the top and it is customized to each app So if you get a text message you can reply right there in the notification island without opening the app If you are listening to spotify it has all the media buttons in the notification island Functionally it is the same Im not sure what you find ugly about a bubble
"So its really just new animations for notifications And they are locking that behind the pro model


I get liking the new animations but it is ridiculous the amount of praise you see and people talking about it as if its some new amazing feature"
Because its not for notifications it has nothing to do with them
I dont think its all notifications I think only certain activities will use the island like timer live activities phone call etc
People are so salty  It was a nice touch and if you couldnt see that you are simply blinded by yout hatred 
"Its truly bizarre People here are acting as if Apple just invented some revolutionary thing Its literally just notifications that blend a bit with the notch the notch which is still ridiculously big The Samsung flagship had a better looking notch almost 4 years ago httpswwwgooglecomsearchqsamsunggalaxys10clientfirefoxb1mbiw408bih823sourcelnmstbmischsaXved0ahUKEwjYjYTjtYP6AhWmMVkFHXiYD5AQAUIBygCbiw408bih823imgrcLupzTRmkZO4h7M


People are talking about being able to interact with it as if its some crazy new idea Guess what you have been able to interact with all along Your actual screen Who cares if you can interact with the notch when you could just have a much smaller notch and interact with actual screen


This has got to be the most meaningless iphone update I have seen especially considering the regular iphone 14 uses a recycled chip from last year which is just unheard of in the phone industry especially at that price point


I think this just goes to show that with the right marketing people will eat up anything"
No The current one avoids that by herding user interactions to the left and right of the notch instead of the center area
"because this is the first truly amazing UX feature Weve seen come out of Apple since iphone Xs swipe up

This honestly is brilliant and I cant believe no one else thought of it first

This is absolutely going to be copied left and right for good reason"
Why would it be copied when the other companies have a pinhole cutout and not a giant pill or whatever that is
"Hopefully yes

Good functional design should be something that is shared and replicated That way everyone benefits

Im still more interested in going dull under the display camera but this is a solid stop gap and a cool UI trick"
I think it will be forgotten quicker than the touch bar
Ill be surprised if this doesnt come with Samsungs next flagship
Apple is so ahead of Android in UX and design But I dont think the island notch will be copied since most manufacturers have absolutely tiny hole punches or moving the camera under the screen
just delusional pinhole camera is just way better
But its not a notch anymore since its not coming from the edge
Is it even an issue to begin with Just dabbed my finger on mine and couldnt notice a difference and surely you could just rub it a little in order to clean it if that was an issue
Theve designed the island to be activatable by touch so it will easily happen for us with fat thumbs And with the camera on the right side even more so for us right handed people with fat thumbs
Spot on Quality of all under the screen cameras Ive seen is piss poor even on the latest and greatest foldables like Samsungs z Fold models Seems like the section of glass on top of the under screen cameras that enables them to hide also degrades the image quality since they have to function as both a display pixel and a pane of glass at the same time
"I must partially disent

in optimal conditions my phone with google cam can take pictures at the height of others

the speech changes when conditions are not optimal

But I must say that they are not as bad as many think I speak of mine not the  samsungs one"
Oh true forgot about the Beats Pill though thats under the Beats brand
Might call it the iLand instead lol
A hole  The glorious hole  Glory Hole TM  if you will
Eeeeeh its not what Id call a notch however Id see a notch as a chunk instead of an isolated area
But its not a notch
Its closer to a hole punch which doesnt sound great
Yeah it feels like a more natural way to have a notch or pill on a phone than any previous designs
Definitely the best way Ive seen a holenotch style design handled yet
Too bad he aint around anymore
Bro 3D Touch was so good  I miss it so much  The torch worked so well in the lock screen  Im actually getting emotional thinking about it  I miss my iPhone XS Max because of this I have the 13 mini which is also good but it doesnt have force touch  plus I dont like the aluminium rather than stainless steel
Thats a good one too but Click Wheel was my jam back then
I think retina display is an evergreen term As long as the resolution is high enough for a given screen size to not be able to see individual pixels from normal usage distance whether thats a phone or a monitor or a TV
169 video on my 13 pro max doesnt get anywhere near the notch unless you zoom in In fact even 189 video fits under the notch
Isnt the display even wider than 169 I think its slightly over 21
What are you on about How the hell are you upvoted Have you ever seen a phone or understand aspect ratios
"Oh for sure I switched from a Pixel 3 to a 12 Pro last year due to a trade in deal and found myself unable to deal with several parts of i0S Sold it and dusted off my Pixel 2 until the 6 launched  

The island does improve iOS notification capabilities but it is still far behind Android in this area"
"lol no shit 

Obviously if they could hide a camera underneath the screen they would"
"Dont give them ideas 

ads ruin everything on the internet"
Oh fuck
ugh someones gonna make it a burger or some shit
Just like the notch was
Did I say innovative I said it was a cool effect and it is
Idk who we is but I like this design
I want it to be cool The notch has never bugged me
You got a mouse in your pocket Its expanding the area to be able to use more than just the time and signal bars while not resorting to a subpar under screen camera Sign me up
Speak for yourself
So where would you put the front camera and faceid sensors
Under display cameras and sensors arent ready for prime time yet so what do you want
The notch is ugly on phones and an abomination on laptops
Why
"Yeah the dead space is always deadspace but theyve redesigned toast notifications to integrate and hide the dead space 

Its a hack to embrace the dead space but a clever hack"
Yes they are utilizing the dead space more effectively as a white space or empty space which is a useful design concept
Theres some part of the island that is always dead space and others that arent and change based on the dynamic content That was kinda hard to fit into a succinct point so thats why I said its sometimes dead space
Some people are saying the dynamic island is whats pushing them to upgrade It seems pretty ridiculous to me They basically added some complications to the top taskstatus bar but made the background black And people are going crazy
"It probably wouldnt work nearly as smoothly with a notch that connects to the edge of the bezel 

Expanding outward in any direction would always leave an ugly area where it connects to the bezel 

Making it a pill puts a little color between the pill and the bezel that would otherwise always be just black Makes it a nice box when it expands out to music or notifications etc 

Doesnt really add anything since that little bit of screen is still functionally useless but removes a little black dead space"
"	I think the name is trying to make it sound like it has to be an island

It kinda sounds like youre just looking for something to complain about Its just a name"
Youre a towel
Mostall other phones dont have notches They obscure the camera hole as much as possible Apple is accentuating it
Lol idk what to tell you if you dont know what a notification manager is its just where your notifications are The dynamic island is not a feature or a phone seller its a very crafty and clever way to disguise the components of the notch while they cant have them hidden and its a pretty great way of doing it Its a flashy aesthetics thing no more
"It displays incoming notifications and system alerts in a more non intrusive way than phones without it 

It also shows data you want to keep track of in the background without having to leave applications music player sports widgets phone calls etc

It expands to show controls over apps that use it without having to go to the app 


How is that nothing"
"httpsijunkiecomios14featuresapplecopiedandroidhttpsijunkiecomios14featuresapplecopiedandroid

I switched from Android to iPhone last December  Please dont pretend OSes dont copy eachother"
Right but the screen size and position of notifications isnt changing So idk how itll be harder to use one handed
"Tbf iPhone 12 wasnt really known for its great battery It had a pretty mediocre battery Iirc it had about 6 hours of intensive use from 1000

The 13 pro max really upped the game It has the best battery in the industry Also probably you phones peak performance capability also has probably gone down by now"
"My 12 literally lasts me two days I finish the day a little above 50

Idk what you install on your phone but its probably malware or something running all the time and draining the battery"
When ppl actually test the pro max will have a similar battery 10511 hrs but ig the real winner will b the 14 plus
True but Im not waiting that long
I have the Pacific Blue iPhone 12 Pro as well and its easily one of my favorite colors that Apple has ever produced Still though that Space Black and Deep Purple are calling to me Im torn between the two One thing is for sure its going to suck to part with the Pacific Blue
Not using a case
Treat your device better I dont use a case and havent cracked a phone in years
"The black is actually a new darker color

Comparison photos here https9to5maccom20220907iphone14prohandson"
Lol same Kept on searching for purple ip14 pro photos but uhm still a no for me
"No doubt but blue and green have been in the pro line since it was launched one of them could return for the midcycle extra

I have a feeling purple is becoming a fan favorite as well i believe its the most popular colored air  mini ipad at least anecdotally its the one which is sold out more often in my region undoubtedly apple wouldnt be considering purple as THE flagship color on a whim

love that because purple has been my favorite color for decades"
Totally agree to it Looks Very unique and stylish in hands
Green is not a creative colour
"I love the green My iPhone X still works so maybe sitting tight and hoping for a new option can work

I know its silly but its a 1000 phone I should like how it looks I really dont care for any of the colors they showed"
The Pacific Blue iPhone 12 Pro and Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus are my two all time favorites
"Same I never cared about phone colors until I got my blue 12 Pro Max Its such a nice color  I went with midnight blue for my watch because of it and then got a blue MagSafe wallet cheap one from Amazon and they look great together Went without a case for a while now only use clear cases Lots of work and care put into getting these colors not going to hide them with an opaque case

Hopefully they bring back blue next year"
But the camera array is still like 20 of the back with the color visible
"Yep Im convinced this is the longterm goal after reading your comment and others here 

Seems obvious in hindsight"
It reminds me of Mr and Mrs Incredible yelling at Dash to aim for 2nd placehttpsyoutubeoIjQhBiZxQ instead of 1st despite having super speed
They definitely have the 5 year roll out hidden in the tuck Lol
"Sir the lab had an amazing breakthrough in battery technology We can get these batteries in all the 14s

Ugh ok we already have planned out to iPhone 19 What are we supposed to do with the batteries we have Lose profit Get your stupid ideas under control Why sell the staircase when you can sell the individual steps throughout the years

Oh sorry wrong sub APPLE REVOLUTIONARY"
Yep they will never regress in camera quality Battery life has happened 11 to 12 Pro minor decrease but camera is a huge selling point and theyd get so much negative press
Unless you have the Galaxy Fold and you are taking selfies with the superior back camera problem solved  just sayin
"Apples not going to downgrade that picture quality

Like they didnt downgrade phone by remoing other features in the pastD

Many years in future when they will release phone without notch and apple fanboys will shit themself"
Nah not really The screen quality is just dimmer around the sensors vs completely missing on other phones
My samsung from 4 years ago has faceID and touchscreen with the notch being just a small half cm camera
thats some implressive mental gymnastics
"there is already many phones with bezels less thick than half the thickness of the new iphones black hole so that point makes no sense 

And no most movies are not 169 and many youtubers already upload all their content in ultrawide resolution exactly because most phones do not sport a 169 aspect ratio anymore"
I suppose it sort of does  in a weird highly convoluted way
But if they just had a camera then they could have a much smaller punch
Plus too thick to fit in any normal pants
Until Apple comes up with a foldable that is iPhone user myself but lots of fanboy delusion here as usual per such threads
You care enough to respond
They turned something that should have been uglya hole punch on your screenand made it beautiful and fun with the way the UI animates around it Instead of just adding it in and doing nothing else they went ahead and designed around it so it would feel natural
Have you not seen anything about it
Yeah this is why Apple is incredible at marketing
It already had faceid thats not a new feature
And before you had huge bezels which looked even worse
hmmmhttpsiimgurcomlYmGC0Pjpg
Youre using the iPhone app that is universal so it works on iPad too but is just stretched out The Apollo developer has been promising an iPad specific is coming soon for the last 23 years so its turned into somewhat of a meme since its still not ready and he never talks about it
Wait whats the Easter egg Is it related to the Apollo app
"Live comments on a Reddit thread
I can have that open while watching a sports game "
I would imagine things like private message notifications
Yes and if it does leak it would probably be quite easy for apple to figure out who it was
"Exactly it  When it comes to anything that can be gleaned from the phones appearancelike the largerhigher MP camera or the new notch we tend to have a pretty accurate picture of things by the time were within a few months from launch Dummy units cases CADs etc have usually leaked which confirm which rumors were BS and which were accurate

The best you can get with software and even internals sometimes is maybe seeing what the folks who apparently had legit sources about the formfactor had to say  Its mostly just guessing and prone to surprises like this though"
Yeah but that was mostly about using the space between those components for the privacy indicators no mention of the whole island thing
"Whole phone industry filled with UX designers never thought of using the notch 

Must be easy to be UX designer at Apple competition just wait for apple and copy them"
" Nice how they embraced the notch limitation and actually made good use of it

yup but then I am wondering how much work this will add for app developers unless Apple have also some fancy easy to adapt code for that"
How are they making good use of it Its still a big cut out on the display
I can also tap the screen how is that not better
You can tap on the notch right now It will take you to the top of the current view and back to where you were before on a second tap if youre using Apollo
"1600 for india 
Was gonna upgrade my X thinking the base would be 256gb but thats 100 extra
Love the phone and colour
Maybe Santa can do me a favour"
14 got the SE treatment lmao
Why The only changes 99 of users will notice are the different notch style and AOD which the 13PM couldve easily done if they didnt artificially lock the feature to iPhone 14 pro btw
Shit a 13 PM is gonna be a lot of money anyway might as well splurge for the next best
A punchhole and notifications Almost all of them
Which others The rest of the industry moved on from large notches 5 years ago Apple is the only one that still needs to work around it
Lol thats all it takes to be genius Just doing something simple no one else bothered to do Its neat as a little gimmick but its just a distraction from a problem that is actually being solved by others I wouldnt call it genius
Apple shouldve done what a lot of phone manufacturers are doing and change the aspect ratio from 169 to something a little taller If feels way less like youre losing a big chunk of screen to a camera notch when youve got a taller screen when you want it and black bars on both sides when youre watching 169 content
Definitely there is a crazy amount of tech packed into that tiny space Under display selfie cameras still majorly suck quality wise too
I love it on my 2020 M1 MBP after installing BetterTouchTool and GoldenChaos I find it criminal Apple didnt put this level of functionality out of the box with it
"Android has had floating notifications and customisation around placement  size on them for quite some time but they were a pain to implement for devs I ended up binning them off two apps I added them on as the variety in display size resolutions android versions and permissions just ended up breaking stuff 

Apple normally nail the integration part I just hope they do the devs a solid and encourage them to use it"
Man if usb c is your deal breaker dont even think about the airpods Guarantee you theyll release a usb c airpods version right alongside the usb c iPhone Hold out brother
I feel like I want to buy it now but the tradein value for my 12Pro through Apple is ass I just have to wait for ATT to have those crazy trade in offers like 3 months after release
You missing what you dont mind I just dont want to carry three different cables for my devices ipad iphone and watch
"Im curious about this because the score thing has never really made sense to me Are there people out there who 1 care so much about a particular team or game that they want to know the score all the time yet also 2 dont care enough to watch live or PVR Im not trying to be a jerk I just dont see much of a use case so Im curious 

Maybe Im just too much of a fanatic but I dont know if theres much of a crossover between those two ideas"
"Thats cool when you just want to see the results at a glance with the AoD 

When youre using the iPhone in other apps having the latest score without having to switch to the sports app is really nice"
"Push notifications Those are good for some things but annoying for others 

The island is better suited for things that constantly update like call duration sports scores or the music youre playing"
In the middle of the wilderness
"Buy Apple so you can safely go get lost in the middle of nowhere and require emergency services

Those Android scrubs have to lame shit like being careful"
Galaxy fold year over year is changing a lot with how much better the folding is becoming Not even a proper comparison to be making about annual refreshing of phones
"Ive only had the fold 3 and did upgrade to the 4 It was actually an upgrade better chip camera battery and form factor

You guys have same from factor since the iphone was invented and last years chip lmaooo"
Yeah and it doesnt look as good as this new dynamic island why does apple come up these dumb ass names
we all can have our own private islands now
Had they thrown money at app developers it would probably still exist Their App Store was a barren waste land of shitty to mediocre apps and most companies with iOSandroid apps didnt bother to make an app for windows phone I had their phone and the OS was great for the time but I dropped it due to app availability
"Microsoft kills it with the Xbox though Nothing in gaming comes even close to what Game Pass offers 

And a Series S for 249 is a low barrier to entry for a lot of games people want to play without having to invest in a PC or their competitor Sony unless its a PS exclusive"
"Its always been that way Its not a matter of who does it first Its about who does it the best and how you present it

The mouse was nothing spectacular But Apple used it in a way that actually useful and changed the experience"
Man I had a matte black Nokia 920 with Windows OS and wireless charging I believe this was like 2012 and that was one of my all time favorite phones
I still miss the Zune music app UI from my old Windows Phone sometimes
"Thats webOS the mobile OS generational equivalent of Xerox PARC 


webOS still has features that both Android and iOS havent copied And they were way ahead of the curve with everything else other than hardware


iOS and Android desperately needs webOS unified messaging service for example 


I think the best feature of Windows Phone was their docked mode shortly before the project was canned Dex before Dex and better than the Atrix"
Metro with its Live Tiles that you could size however you wanted arrange however you wanted and had a million colors you could make them was fantastic The whole UX was super clean and smooth
It literally makes it much better
"It would be a dynamic peninsula if they adopted it to older models

An island needs to be isolated to be an island"
Implement a hardware upgrade with a software update how hard can it be
Its the size of it The pill cutout is compact compared to the notch
Apple came up with alot of designes that others use now aswell
"Not true I have seen software for holepunch phones that utilize the hole in a similar way

Apple truly innovated it a step further at least through integrating it more extensively into their OS but they also are the only ones who put such a huge hole in their screens"
Im pretty sure it can detect touch though
"Do you not know what interactive means You can interact with it so interactive

The cameras are under the screen thats why you can physically touch it"
I still dont know why I should care about USBC
Facts you and me cant wait  in 2030 once they do it But Im all seriousness I hope we can get it by next year tho
"Amen to this 

Honestly Im kinda glad that they didnt go ham on this phone makes me happy to hold onto my 13PM for another few years at least"
Chip is 20 more efficient But gains probably largely lost to always on display
But its not 2000 nits is software limited to only when youre in direct sunlight and likely only for short periods of time I think they said 1600 nits hdr which is still very impressive though
Shoulda raised interest rates faster 
is a physical connector Do you mean USB 30 or USB 32 gen 2 level 5 or whatever
"For those wondering you can see it in one of the assets used on their iPhone 14 Pro page

httpswwwapplecomviphone14proaimagesoverviewdynamicislanddynamichwbtl4fomgspyusmall2xpnghttpswwwapplecomviphone14proaimagesoverviewdynamicislanddynamichwbtl4fomgspyusmall2xpng"
The reveal video will show the island doing its island thing then the phone goes to full screen video zoom in on the island and it bloops down to nothing Everyone cheers
Exactly what Im thinking will happen when they ditch the notchassuming its received as well as the positive early reaction suggests
"Dont need to Most android phones now have settled down on a tiny front camera which is designed to be ignored Almost feels like there is nothing intruding on your screen Although Im disappointed that the pop out cameras never caught on 

Every other functionality that apple introduced just needs a swipe down in android While you can see what notifications you have along with other system stats on the top bar at a glance

Apples implementation looks good though and it should be a good add on to the atrocious iOS notification system"
siri gave a non answer
Exactly Removing frontfacing buttons turned out to be the right choice and adopting a gesturebased UI was the icing on top of the cake
" I mean the vision was always going to be an uninterrupted full screen device

When did Apple say that"
No the XS
"They are calling attention to it  its a black bar with display above it itll be more noticeable than the notch

But I think the real winner isnt for the user of the iPhone but for people around the user who will see this thing working as an interface area and thatll be what differentiates the new pro from previous phones"
And c touching area around camera will leave smudges all the time
"Its because its genuinely a lot of effort to implement and maintain since it requires core OS changes Its a decision with a lot of sideeffects  


Its also on a feature that is likely to be transient go away soon so they probably dont want to invest a bunch of engineering and design effort on a feature they eventually want to phase out"
too much fragmentation and diversity in android phones to have been able to think of this
"But you realise that most of the work is done at the top by Google and the rest of the ecosystem benefits

There is no way that Google was going to be able to force a design change onto Android makers that will direct their hardware design They value the choice of being able to develop their phones in their own direction but they all decided to engineer their way out of the problem because it would be unrealistic to get Google to make everyone adopt a pill notch in the middle of their phones

And they didnt want to do the same kind of work Apple is doing either It is expensive and needs the right people to make that choice

Dynamic Island shows is that they are fully committed now They are all in"
Gonna have to see it person to judge whether its gonna be distacting or not But after few days many users will forget that its there already
But it is If you have an active call you can tap on the call to bring up options
Except it is interactive And there are multiple comments responding to you saying why it is but you cant seem to say anything more substantial than bbut its not1
Bruh USD and EUR is pretty much 11 now EU VAT in Romania is 19 so that would make it 1190 but Apple Tax rounded it up to 1299
Tbf US prices never did The Euro price increase is insane Even with a 10 sales tax in the US which no state has it would still be 200 cheaper
"But the EU prices were much higher than in the US before taxes the EU price hikes just keep the EU prices higher rather than avoid them being lower than in the US

Also Apple has a massive subsidiary a big campus and lots of staff and a lot of sales in the EU and they never bring EU revenue to the US to be taxed so why does it matter so much how much their EU revenue is in USD Only because the stock market responds to USD revenue and profit figures That looks like a poor reason to fleece your customers"
Look at the USDEUR rates its 1  1
greed
In India too Went from 1500 to 1750 smh
Probably the insane amount of regulations that the EU has that ends up costing Apple more
Uhhhhh I would probably buy from Europe just to keep my SIM tray personally
Taxes in EU are around 20 Its still 100 eur off
Yeah we can
They increased the price in EU even when accounting for that Here it went from 1159 to 1349 for the base Pro
Thats because not all states even have sales tax in some places Americans pay zero percent above the marked price for things If you wanted an online store to display withtaxtotals then it would need to be able to 1 detect the state youre in and 2 make decisions based on the type of item as many states that do have sales tax enforce it conditionally upon whether its food diapers fancy luxury electronic toys etc
Dont forget that the VAT in Hungary is 27 This topic is always brought up when people compare USEU prices but American taxes are a lot lower
The Euros depreciation is not as a result of the gas crisis but due to poor financial decisions made by the ECB during covid followed by the lack of initiative to raise the interest rate to control the inflation
"Not really as someone else mentioned its mainly because of the interest rates that the US Federal Reserve has put into place You can see the same trend with the JPY But the JPY is definitely in a worse place Last I checked it was 1 USD to 143 yen 

I also dont think the gas  Ukraine was will be settled that easily"
"	Why is the EU 20 more expensive by default before taxes

Its not 1329 includes taxes which Apple says amount to 236 in France for example

So the phone pretax is 1093 which is around 1080 USD today instead of 1000 USD in the US"
Throw away the key
"Yeah thats what people said about 64gb 

Also Im not saying they should raise the starting price Im saying they should keep the starting price the same but increase the basemodel storage for that starting price"
"Maybe so but its still bad when the price per gb for storage is still dropping It smacks of companies wanting to keep their prices consistent but still making a higher profit Why not drop the price of the 128 down by say 50 bucks and make the 256 the new 999 price point

And this isnt just Apple Samsung did the same thing with their Flip 4 recently and I found that just as annoying Especially when like with the new iPhone the size of pictures and video are getting much bigger Those 48mpx RAW images are going to fill a 128gb storage in a matter of hours"
You dont use iCloud photos I use iCloud everything and my storage is only 20gb used
I was going to reply about podcasts before I even finished your comment I only have a 64gb X Max but I kept noticing photos Id taken hours earlier were already offloaded into the cloud Popped into storage to see why and Podcasts was taking up over half of my storage Deleted a ton of saved episodes that I hadnt instructed it to download and saw a setting maybe new that limits the number of automatic downloads Totally helped my storage issues
Im at 114 gb But I can downsize
ouch owie so basically rest of the world pay much higher so that US could keep the same price
I guess the other side isnt always greener Im originally from the US but think life in Austria is much better lol the US is a big mess
Itll work got it all sorted with my carrier Imagine how unhappy people who travel often would be if their phone didnt work abroad The only thing is finding a carrier aboard that can do an esim in a prepaid plan which Ive searched for my travels already  Ive always done sim free  no plan phones so itll be interesting with this esim thing
It says on their site that its off when face down or in your pocket
It would be amazingly stupid since Android has done that for ever
"Yeah I really hope it turns off while its in a pocket or face down or when Im sleeping Itd be pointless to keep it on when I cant see it

Im also kinda paranoid about OLED burnin after I got it on an OLED TV but Im sure theyve designed it so that its not an issue

EDIT I see from the website that it turns off when face down or in a pocket I hope it also turns off during my sleep focus actually itd be nice if that was an option for any focus"
You must BARELY use your phone I charge my 12 Pro every single night and depending on how much YouTube is watched during the day may need to charge for a bit in the afternoon to get me thru the full day Took my phone off the charger this morning at about 9am and am sitting at 17 at 1134pm
"That too

Hm I still cant imagine it would utilize too much power And it probably has an in your pocket mode where it turns off the screen if the brightness sensors are off"
OLEDs also have the potential for burnin unfortunately
I mean it was on the 13 pro last year so Im assuming they kept it I mentioned it since I would be coming from a 12 Pro if I decide to upgrade
Yh its on the website when you compare models
It is Would be crazy if they wouldve removed it
Yup But wont that come off in your pocket
I meant it as the 13 series not a actual 13S
Preach
Whats considered excess and who gets to decide
When accounting for VAT the prices were broadly similar remember that 999 price doesnt include the sales tax for the state you live in and most of them have far lower sales tax than the 20 VAT that is usual in the EU
I just want you to know this was a game changer for me thank you
Nice
"	people working outside using their phone not that crazy

If youre working you arent staring at your phone for an hour Still doesnt change the fact the display will dim anyways since it wont sustain the brightness for more than 5 mins like literally every phone ever made

	how would it dictate when to activate

How does your car with automatic head lights dictate when to turn on Ambient light sensors arent exactly a new thing 

What part of this are you confused on Its just 2000 peak brightness it works the exact same as every other smart phone ever made just brighter"
I mean youre just calling out the advantage they have considering they build the screens they can take unpatented features and copy them Compare the S7 releasing before the X to the S8 released after
Same way TSMC produces chips for NVIDIA Apple etc iPhone and Galaxy displays come from the same manufacturers but have their proprietary design sets

"How exactly did you calculate 45 tax

The 14 Pro Max price contains 250 taxes where I live making it around 100 pricier than in the US Apple devices have always been pricier outside the US so nothing changed here They didnt bump the prices compared to last year the Euro just lost in value"
8 taxes in New York lets say 10 The Pro comes out to 1200 Is this the same as 1450
VAT is 20 Math is still 100 EUR off
Yes and the US price includes average tax as well 1200 is not 1450
I does and included before too So still price increase of several hundreds
As a consumer comparing products from both companies  I dont care
Funny how only apple is doing this But sure keep defending the greed of one of the richest companies on the planet
Thats crazy  It can be more than a month worth of salary
"I got through the process here in France theres 258 of taxes and other things

Price without it is 1071 compared to the 999"
I doubt it probably have to do some design changes with the logic board Who knows there has to be a reason As much of a disappointment it was with the 14 if the 15 doesnt change over then theres some significant reason
The other challenge is that ATT is offering me 700 for my phone though a promotion I feel like thats going to not exist next year So do I upgrade for the few hundred bucks maybe 200 more than a battery swap and then trade that phone in for a much higher value next year
"Why is usbc worth the wait Im all for the change now I think usbc has reached a level of saturation that makes sense But I cant see how in day to day use it trumps most other features 

Its probably the least interesting thing about any phone 

I think usbc next year is a pretty safe bet But they could do an eu only model Or remove the port entirely So theres risk with waiting"
Its good that now an apple watch charger can be used to charge AirPods but youll have to carry a lightning cable anyway
No idea why youre being downvoted but youre 100 spot on
"Had to reply to that cause you couldnt deny the rest eh Hahaha half of those amazing ideas are not coming from Americans but from specialized expats living there that had to be outsourced cause you didnt have enough smart people hahahaand most innovative companies China Japan South Korea Half of the important brands are not even Americanbest technology is Mostly Asian best car are European
Btw I am from the Netherlands you can check in a map where it is one of the richest countries and with the best quality of life in the planet and no we do not have school shootings every weekhahahah and yes I do know how to speak multiple languages unlike you"
I replace my battery every 23 years and it feels like a new phone Only reason Im finally upgrading is because iOS 16 wont support it haha
There are other factors too like the refresh rate Older iphones can only drop down to 10 or 20Hz while always on screens typically can drop down as low as 1Hz
"You actually getting downvoted for stating the truth is actually sad

The S7 with its fixed 60Hz OLED display had Always On back in 2016 half a decade after Nokia introduced the feature in Simbian OS even with fixed refresh rate displays

Battery life is a nonissue as back then it drained less than 1hr and users can simply turn it off if theyd rather get the most battery life"
Which is exactly the problem everyone jumpsnat the opportunity to parrot the same talking point about the Euro dropping yet if you ask them what happens when it rebounds they all go silent 
" literally utilizing it as an interface

That is backwards  Theyre not utilizing the notch as an interface they are restrictingshapingcoloring the GUI in silly unnecessary ways for the sole purpose of confusing the perception of the terrible notch

As Steve Jobs said with iPhone 1 the whole point of a digital display is that it can show you whatever you need in the best way  Dynamic Island violates that by letting a horribly flawed hardware compromise be the guiding factor for how the GUI is made  

This is just a notification area  System Tray  Touchbar  animated Title Bar like every device already has except now its styled to look like the hardware notch lol and with more deliberation behind how devsapps can use notifications a good thing but has literally nothing to do with Dynamic island or notch"
But its not a behind the screen camera so theres still some dead space
"I thought thats what the person meant by the timer thing Didnt understand why the time couldnt just by at the top if it was numbers whys there gotta be a pill

Ill check it out later"
Apparently Apple phones can swap eSims via bluetooth but this option isnt available between iphones and nonapple devices And there we go hand tipped they want the SIM CARD to just be another strip of razor wire in the fortyfoothigh wall of their garden
I hope thats the case in Australia too I like being able to swap between my good phone and a beater for when I go mountain biking or 4wding without having to deal with esim crap
Because it was 200 less last year
also making it esim only would free up even more space inside the mini hope they will bring it back
What they mean is that there are no pixels above the camera like some new experimental android phones as it is cut out from the display while being under it
You keep implying things the other user is not talking about
Yes I know which makes it all the worse for other smartphone companies that Apple has surpassed them all in regards to this on their first try
Because currency rates change Its been a year and a bunch of shit has happened
"I looked up the exchange rates a year ago and if you convert dollars to pounds directly and account for VAT you get 875 So the price of 949 that we got last year was an even BIGGER markup 

The pound is worth less now"
Im talking about the price when it was released a year ago
"I mean not really i can take my phone laptop and tablet with earphones away and only need 1 cable

Apples ecosystem needs at least 2 cables They just need to ditch the lightning and apple fans need to stop protecting them as its all about the money they generate from propriety tech"
Lighting is slower to charge and slower for data transfer
Ah  no not satellite tracking I meant calling AllTrails does the same thing with GPS Wasnt clear on that
But if you really think about it our thumbs are not the only fingers that are touching the screen Its called dynamic because youre using any finger from both hands They cant design it any other way without touching the camera  without the scroll to home feature unless they bring back a physical button or Taptic touch which wouldnt make sense makes the phones to heavy
No I mean deliberately showing black when theres no camera hole there
"The phone will negotiate its charging speeds automatically

Like I can plug my 100w USBC charger into my Android phone and charge the phone without issue So you literally only need one good charger for all your devices"
I have one of those charger blocks that has a 100W and 2x 20w built into it
Not true lol
My X did half a day My 13 Pro Max does 2 days
Personally I used the shit out of that phone lol I miss it
"I said between the X and IPhone 14

Im an iOSMacOS software engineer so Im looking from a user standpoint all the time for development of features 

Beyond the camera what significant day to day game changers have been made since the iPhone X that are noticeable by the average user 

I can only think of ESIM which was long overdue and maybe an always on display which has been on Android for many years

For a trillion dollar company there is nothing that comes across as wow this is incredible since the iPhone X beyond the camera"
So what does that have to do with anything Im just saying that there was an upgraded camera but none of the rumours for 8K video were true so realistically whats the big benefit to it for most people  Nothing really
"No face ID Meaning you unlock the thing and apps with your face Thats been a feature for ages I for example prefer a fingerprint sensor under the screen and the iPhone doesnt have one Thats a big NO all my banking apps make use of the fingerprint sensor to speed things up 

Bad camera Maybe the 300 phones camera is not as good but the asus literally uses the main cameras as a selfie camera no way to compete against that Flagship android phones like the s22 ultra or Pixel They leave the iPhone to dust 

The truth is and always has been apple sells outdated phones for more than the competition and somehow has the audacity to call it leading edge tech Worse specs than most mid range android phones

The amazing new 2000nit screen Its made by Samsung

The Island Thats just a notch

Animations The less the better makes the phone feel much faster

Cameras If you want the best look at the s22 ultra or Pixel But even then you are better off buying a mid range phone and spending the rest on a real camera"
Yep I have Visible as well So even for you the moment you step out of US and other than Canada or countries not supported by Visible for roaming what are you going to do I think Airlo per say might work but lot of the local SIMs are much cheaper
"I understand and appreciate your view

I just have to set realistic goals "
Yeah thats the normal function for a couple years now I was referring to the new  displaying
But do you like it I have it on too but the amount just doesnt seem as effective as when it showed the battery at a little sliver Wish they would combine the two Full battery white with black numbers 50 half white half black different color numbers 25 not 14 white black numbers Probably looked like ass and they didnt do it but I would like the hybrid options
My pro max lasts me all day with heavy use  dont need to look at the percent lol
"Doesnt look like Apple was copying them if it took 6 years lol 

If so theyre terrible at doing so"
"Is the new pill bigger I personally cant tell 

And your talking too logically Go ask Samsung why the mock every move from Apple and then turn around and do the same thing lol"
"	 Ive worked in telecom for long time 

Mann Im glad you led off with this line I would have never have believed anything else you said afterwards lol Thanks for the useful facts your sure showed me 

No but seriously tell the android manufactures I appreciate them coming out with these new features for my iPhone"
Cool I actually didnt know that this is the most informative reply Ive gotten so far
"But that is also due to the strength of the dollar

But it is a bit unfortunate for the nonAmericans out there "
Yep those Samsungs have my eyes on them as well
Are you dense The Face ID sensors and frontfacing camera are cutouts theyre not integrated into the screen The hell are you talking about
The dynamic island is something an idiot came up with to hide the real issue The holy grail of huge phone is to be a le to use it one handed easily instead of relying on two hands like a tablet While I appreciate apples top notch hardware cpuand ram performance etc there is no denying this
No smiling A good orgasm will do that Sounds like you need one
Sir you are on an Apple release thread on REDDIT You know damn well it is needed lol
Ok thats actually a bigger feature than all the camera stuff combined
Same for the S21 and 22
I didnt reply to any comments besides the ones replying to me I just wanted to throw my opinion out there because I hate seeing a whole ass sub worship a corporate entity
"Makes sense now with the price hike outside the US That much more to keep the tray on top of inflation

Bravo Apple"
Will it give me an option when I pre order the new one
True true good idea
"My AC3000 has 5GHz and the backhaul is 1733 Gbps so when Im wired to one of my 3 satellites I get 900Mbps which is maxing out my internet connection anyway

My stream devices cameras printer car etc dont need double the speed so the cost of upgrading is not worth it

Most households dont even use mesh networks so theyre not even optimizing their AC networks let alone an AX network

Most of my older devices including my car dont support WiFi6 let alone 6E and most of them are still 24GHz

Like I said most folks would be better served by a triband AC mesh vs a single WiFi6e router Theyre also likely bound to a 1Gbps internet connection so 17Gbps max WiFi speed wont help them much"
Well team after 85 years this edit is being done in bulk to all my posts and comments because Reddit managements decision to effective kill the API for apps like Apollo RIF Sync etc is insane so Im out Thanks for everything
I heard were talking about Apollo am I too late for the strokes
Its called Reddit Is Fun not RiF so try that way I havent touched it in years and it used to be Android only so Im not even sure its an Apollo competitor Things may have changed
Just remembered Im in apple subreddit and yall cant get RiF
Agreed boost is the best
Wish he was excited about fixing bugs like the broken video player instead of a new pill only available on the latest iPhones Or the Open in Apollo page that gives you no information on the content so youre left with multiple tabs that all look the same instead of having something to identify the content Or users being mixed in with subs instead of being separate Apollo needs some house cleaning
Lol what Do you not read the change log Like ever
"Apollo has one of the most responsive if not the most responsive developers Ive ever come across

It doesnt matter if you think the features arent useful They obviously are because theyre based on what users asked for The app is smooth and the dev is very considerate in how and when he updates it"

Its popular and its developer is known for well using some of Apples new features earlier than many others  usually on launch day of a new iOS X0

In the new notch there are 2 punch holes the screen between them stays black to hide it The old ones are separated from the screen so they are not touch sensitive
"Just tried it on contacts and it doesnt work You have to touch the screen below the notch Although maybe thats also the case on the Island

And yes animation wont look as cool as in the Island VS notch"
Tap on time to scroll all the way to the top
Well it utilizes it yes But Android has had it for years with its 60hz Not the best situation but it doesnt use that much battery really
"For having it

E JP Im not sure if its touch sensitive or if it requires a lot of swiping and whatnot"
"1 they arent locking it The animations are based around hardware that only the 14 pro has The whole reason why its getting praise because its hardwaresoftware working together so smoothly Without the hardware being there it wouldnt work

2 its a cross between notifications and a new type of actionable status bar"
"It has everything to do with notifications That is its main job

Currently the notification banners display things like incoming calls texts sports results directions stock All things the dynamic island includes"
ya rather than it being obtrusive apple actually leaned into the obtrusion and the result is brilliant cant wait to order mine on friday
 Im a lifelong appleiphone user Definitely not hatred just unimpressed
I dont hate i just thought it was something else from how exited people were on the thread
"I completely agree with this entire chain of comments I know my opinion probably wont carry much weight here as someone who prefers Android but I have also been carrying an iPhone for work for 3 years and own a 2020 iPad Pro so I use both platforms regularly 

I can see why people think it looks slick and you can tell they definitely put a lot of care into making it look cohesive but it already feels like it is being very overhyped Im already seeing comments in here calling this a gamechanging UI paradigm shift that everyone else is going to copy or that its their biggest innovation since the iPhone X when all theyre really doing is putting a fresh coat of paint on their existing experience and making the best out of a meh situation still having the largest display cutout on the market I dont have anything against Face ID but I dont think its really worth the noticeable hit to screen real estate when under display fingerprint readers are as good as they are now Is it a clever way to work aroundintegrate the cutout Sure Is this the exact design they would be using in an ideal world with no cutout I obviously cant say for sure but I suspect that it probably isnt 

The way that iOS handles notifications is one of my biggest gripes about it actually This new design looks very nice but it wont mean much to me if the core functionality is largely unchanged The difference is substantial enough to me that it is one of the primary things that keeps me on Android for my personal phone I barely even bother to interact with or manage notifications on my Apple devices because they just feel so clunky to me compared to Android 

I havent drank the foldable phone koolaid yet myself but I think that they are much closer to being the next major noteworthy innovation in mobile phones rather than what is essentially an aesthetic yet barely functionallydifferent redesign of system notifications Foldables are an actually tangibly different experience vs a shuffling of where and how notifications appear 

Like many mobile phone software innovations you can even trace this idea of trying to blend the software and hardware design together back to WebOS on the Palm Pre Apples implementation is obviously much more substantial but man I really wish we got a different world where WebOS had more time to grow as a mobile platform It was full of some very forwardthinking ideas"
"The reaction and the feature look pathetic  Its a more limited and restricted version of any typical generic notification area  title bar  window  System Tray  The more limited restricted part is that they are trying to deceitfully match the black notch in color shape position and confuse the issue of the notch  Thats not even remotely close to what the priorities of GUI design should be make it look like the hardware flaw so the hardware flaw blends in  The goal of GUI is to do whatever is best not restricting the GUI to camouflage a flaw

And theyre lying and saying this is a feature of blurring the line between hardware and software  Its like coloring a Mac title bar the same color as the display rimbezel so that you can no longer tell if its hardware or softwarenow imagine the monitor rim was black on the left and white on the right random arbitrary example analogous to the problem of the notch so then theyre claiming that this is a wonderful new feature where the left of the title bar is black and the right is white  Its like if a car has rust spots just paint your whole car with a rustlike color and texture  OMG clever

Guess Ill be on my iPhone 6 for another year"
"bro a notch and a hole are not the same thing

notches are edge based cutouts holes do not happen at the edge

obviously you arent going to have an easy time understanding innovative features when you dont understand the basic concepts of what a notch and a hole are look into the concept of negative space as the island is effectively that while the notch and hole punch were not"
No the current one does not in anyway prevent you from touching it and doesnt at all you grab the phone from your bag adjust it and everything look at your phone after normal use the notch is covered in prints at all times like the rest of the phone it simply doesnt matter
Probably because Android tried under screen cameras for a while and then just went to pinholes No one else has the FaceID notch so they probably never considered having a design element around such a small element
"No one else implemented it because most phone manufacturers are doing what they can to minimize bezels and hole punches

Apple had a better shot at it because they are very proud of their front facing hardware and their software devs were required to adapt to the unsightly space required for the phones technology

Probably most putting more tech into figuring out how to simply have an under the screen camera that works well which is going to also be great once it works well"
What does it exactly do that wasnt done by notification bar already
Swipe up was first introduced by Palm on WebOS
Nobody thought of it because they got a way to keep small notches or getting rid of them So they had a ways But for apple taking the notch away or keep small punchouts would be a trade of for its brilliant faceID So for other companies to copy it I dont see that Cz it means theyll have to come back to the notches to do that Which I dont think theyll do that Or maybe use their same small punch holes But they have Ego too So idk
the implementation is very apple tho I still think the pill cutout is ugly might need to see in person
Its a renamed system tray that changes sizes
Can you briefly explain the feature I saw a promo video but Im not sure Im really getting it Is it just keeping whatever the most currently active activity running in the background on the top of the screen even if youre using the phone for another purpose
I doubt that will happen I rather have more viewing space on my screen than have a notch that shrinks and enlarges

"There is nothing brilliant about it  Its the same old generic title bar  notification area  Windows System Tray to take one example that every device already hasexcept now arbitrarily limited to black color and restricted in size and position in order to deceitfully confuses the visual of the terrible notch

The whole point of iPhone going back to Steve Jobs version 10 was that a digital screen adapts to give you what you need  Dynamic Island is a regression that compounds the problem of the notch  Instead of displaying things in whatever ideal style it restricts styling to black pill shapes near the pill

The good part is that it has unified central GUI programming so that app devs can use it in whatever way is helpful like the MacBook Pro touchbar  but again this is no different from notification area  widget  system tray  title bar stuff which weve had for 40 years"
Youre joking right
"Yeah this honestly blew my mind Best new feature for smartphones imo in a longgg time 

Bummed its only on the Pros I think itll definitely be a staple in phones in the near future though But Ive been debating dipping into the Pro pond for the first time and this alone may have sold me Awesome stuff"
" or whatever that is
  
Its a dynamic island"
This should be the top comment Apple isnt doing anything new here
Because theyre gonna make it a giant pill to look like the iPhone
And how will they justify the new cost
or no cutout
"or whatever that is

Whatever happened there"
This is Apple using a pinhole cutout while saying that the notch is iconic design Its literally a digital notch
Well only until FaceID can be done under the screen but good enough for the next 5 years or so I bet
Yes definitely more marketing By the way no one else has Face ID so no one else has real need for this big of a notch I dont see anyone else copying this exactly At most others may try to integrate their cut outs more into the UI but thats it This isnt anything to rave about Just a minor UI change
All other manufacturers racing to make their own island We learn the rounded edges arent really circular they use a complex Fibonacci sequence and it is to die for s
Dynamic pill lol although I dont think a pill that long exists in the world
The camera isnt even going to register your touch so eventually youll get used to avoiding it
Are you that worried about touching your front facing camera
Nah Im sorry but Im just gonna call it the Glorious Hole

Ok but still I wouldnt have called it island If its not a notch Im sure there are plenty of better options lol

"I think it was KRSOne who said

Goddamn guys my synthtits are jacked right now Someone airbrush me a picture of a sexy chrome android in an awkward pose STAT
By default it doesnt overlap the notch but there is a button in the video player to extend to the edge and allow it to overlap I imagine the 14 Pro will be exactly the same
My aspect ratios may have been off but YouTube videos that utilize their super wide aspect ratio like MKBHD will go around the notch and fill the entire display area
Aspect ratio for an iPhone 13 is 1959 so a little bit more than 21 more like 221
Yes dummy I obviously have used phones and have described standard behavior of all video playback on an iPhone since the X What are you on about
Android notifications are so far ahead of iOS its not even funny The thing I like about the island is how seamless and pretty it is but for functionality Id still take Android based on what weve seen so far
"You know as well as I do that the notch and now island is just as much a branding exercise as it is a technology compromise Apple HAS to let everyone know that thier now brandless front of thier device is an iPhone somehow Steve would crawl out of his grave and start murdering executives otherwise

The island is just the new notch which was the new touch ID which was the new power button which fundamentally was just an apple logo

Apple could 100 fix this with existing technology and thier engineering talent They choose not to for branding and profits"
I usually just turn off notifications for stuff like tiktok Instagram Reddit etc i dont mind if its actual engagement with my posts or comments or messages but when they try to recommend content its super annoying
"Outside of food ordering apps Instagram is the most egregious They have all kinds of notification settings but ignore them I get notifications for friends posting stories even though that is explicitly turned off

The food apps Uber DoorDash and Grubhub are the worst offenders for not allowing notifications by type then requiring notifications for food delivery but spamming me with ads when Im not ordering"
Thats app based The app needs to support this But most dont Messaging apps will let you do this most of the time
"Mute ads

Who do you think placed those ads in the apps

Theres not some ad gremlin sneaking them in when developers arent looking"
"Im kinda on both sides here If theres gotta be a notchisland  then there might as well be some way of tying it into the OS as theyve done here but you could have this same level of functionality from notification WITHOUT the screen cutout too so its not like its necessary to have it    


Im an android user and dont really mind the holepunch in my pixel 6 pro in fact I almost never notice its existence  your brain just tunes it out   but with something the size of apples cutout  its nice to see them doing something to integrate it into the screen rather than just having it obstruct viewing for no reason   I think its a neat thing overall but I think the best of both worlds would probably be to find a way to get rid of the notchisland and still do something like that for notifications"
Hole punch for camera and Face ID sensor is under the screen
Were getting there The proximity sensor is under the display with this model The camera and dot projectors are still in the punch out
Exactly Its lipstick on a pig
The other thing that the MKBHD pointed out that is obvious but I hadnt thought of is that since it can display either one full or two mini complications its an ad hoc little multitasking bar
"I dont think any part of the core pillshaped island ever shows things They just tack stuff on around it and make it look like it expands out by putting those tackedon things on a black background

It looks good and seems like the right place to do that stuff but the middle of it is always dead sensor space"
The feature being artificially limited to 14 Pro is a valid complaint The name is just a byproduct of that decision
It will replace some alert messages that appeared in the centre plus they add a lot of new interactions so it will be very hard not to use a second hand  sadly so bad UX
His phone was also going to be at max brightness due to sunlight
In what world had the 13 Pro Max the best battery in the industry I can find 50 phones with better battery life on gsmarena
"Unfortunately my experience is standard

You likely dont use your phone every minute of the hour and or have it on low brightness

Anyone that actively uses their phone sadly have the same experience as me

The newest iPhone probably still wont last a day of heavy use"
The black is really nice but I plan to keep the phone for a long time and black is just not interesting enough to be stuck with I went with the deep purple Wouldve been a tough choice though if sierra blue was an option
Just drive better i havent worn a seatbelt in years
Oh nice thanks I like it more after seeing that comparison Is that what youre going to get
To be clear I totally get why Apple went with the purple color I actually think it looks great although I personally wouldnt choose it since its not a color Ive ever had strong feelings about Im just speculating on why so many people seem disappointed at the lack of blue or green
Nice dhmis reference
Shut up red
Im sorry people are downvoting this amazing reference
"Totally agree 

Im an early adopter and always get new devices day 1 Got the iPhone 13 last year on release day and then a few months later they release the green I was so pissed"
The silver with a matte black skin looks chefs kiss
I would argue cameras are the most important aspect of a phone these days   Phone being the least important feature lmao
"Yep they will never regress in camera quality

  
They did though from the 12 to 13 They absolutely destroyed the telephoto"
But then I would have Galaxy phone lol
Another gimmick similar to 3D TVs
You lost me at Galaxy and lost me again at Fold Im good
"I mean sure

The galaxy ZFold is also an 1800 phone lmao

And theres no benefit to it for selfies because theres no screen on the back anyway You can achieve the same thing on literally any other phone by just turning your phone around"
Yeah cuz selfies arent a hugely popular thing anyways right 
"Not the screen the photos from the camera Every implementation I have seen gives blurry photos picks up artifacts from the screen etc Generally just have atrocious photo quality 

httpswwwthevergecom22776271underdisplayselfiecamerasztemicrosoftxiaomi"
I think he means the camera quality not the screen
FaceID that banks dont even allow you to use because its not secure lol
Correct But they dont just have a camera They have a camera AND Face ID
Nah
I mean it turned it from a small hole to a large ugly hole that has screen around all of it
Explain how its different from a redesigned status bar and controlnotification center
Huh A big thumb in the middle of my screen is a lot more intrusive than a straight line that contains all my notifications
It is there but not optimized for the larger screen It is basically a huge iPhone app
Yeah he made it so that his name always appears purple in the Apollo app
Would be great if you could use it to pin commentstextvideos so theyre visible while typing your comments
I think at this point all the leaks have come from third parties ie case manufacturers Even factory leaks are quite rare if at all
Yeah thats true
And I want to see the way they do it Why the passive aggressiveness
The notch had pretty limited use though you can black it out to the sides to make it disappear and thats pretty much it
I thinkt he only ones who could actually do something this interactive with notches would be android devs and even then theres no consistency in front camera designs in Android world Otherwise I remember Samsung had some fun notification stuff that centered around the pill hole punch cut out in the s10
Notchless is still better overall
"Lmao I never even imagined this but now Samsung is over there in their HQ kicking themselves we had a stagnant hole all these years and we never thought to make it move hahahaha

Oh your Android is pretty cool but does your hole stretch  ok ok Im done lmao"
"No one else has a giant black hole in the middle of their screen that would necessitate this Android phones have tiny pinhole cutouts for their cameras and a status bar for dynamic notification info 

Why would they do this dynamic island thing It looks slick but its a solution to a problem Android phones dont have"
"Android cant use the notch because every phone has it in a different place Like with Microsoft software and hardware are separated and therefore never that tightly integrated

Thats good though Its nice seeing hardware innovations popup at Samsung software innovations at Google and integration innovations at Apple"
"Whole phone industry filled with UX designers never thought of using the notch 

Most Android phones dont have a notch

Android has had a notification bar for a while

Android has had Always On Display for a while

Phones like the LG V10 did this with a second screen httpsmgsmarenacomlgv10pictures7606php"
You could always just have a small hole punch and inscreen fingerprint No need to design a UI around a glaring flaw in the display
Well it couldve been just a big cut out on the display with no software interaction whatsoever While its not ideal its better and more useful than the notch
Because you could always tap the screen now there is effectively more real estate for use Everyone complaining about the notch including me has a little less to complain about now
No you cant youre also pressing just underneath it without realising As far as I can remember iPhones have always taken you to the top when you tap the status bar
You cant The notch does not respond to touches
"Wtf How did I not realize that touching that part of the phone would do that Im using Apollo and now I feel like a space wizard flying back and forth between your comment and the top of the thread

Thank you for teaching me your ways Magic Man  Seriously Ive had this phone for almost four years now and have somehow never touched the top of the screen near where the notch is"
Nah thats the top of the screen still
1299 sadly
Basically the 12 SE2
When its only a couple hundred spread out over two years I might as well jump for the extra features Im not allowed to like the redesign
Exactly At those prices a couple of hundred or so isnt worth the carrier buy in and such
Which phone has a cut out that dynamically and smoothly interacts with the UI as needed to make it as seamless as possible
"When the only tech you pay attention to is apple you always think its revolutionary

Not YOU just people"
"Just doing something simple no one else bothered to do

Not even that

httpsyoutubeyInN7OV4M3k"
But the iPhones are already using a format taller than 169 though Just go and watch a regular Youtube video and youll see 2 beautiful black bars
Man careful what you say I recently got a macbook pro 14 and lamented that a lot of functions seem to be reliant on thirdparty software when it should be baked into the OS and I got eviscerated by people calling me a hater
Ya 1 more year and my patience will be rewarded lol
You can see the trade in value in the store app Its shows trade in values for all carriers
So if the cable and transfer speeds arent an issue for me Theres no problem in getting this one and not waiting for the 15 right
Ask my girlfriend who regularly wants to crucify me when I try to sneak in a stream at the dinner table I guess a quick glance at an always on display beats a video stream in that sense
100 As a baseball fan games are on almost every day which means its impossible to watch all games live updates are key to still following the team especially in the late part of the season
Sometimes youre just busy doing other things Having it live refresh is nice otherwise youre self refreshing
The answer is yes
Being in North America all relevant football matches are going on in Europe which means its afternoon for me while Im at work Im not able to watch streams all the time so keeping up with score is how I do it especially when there are multiple matches going on simultaneously
Yeah like most apple features Ill probably use that more than I ever thought I would
"Sure thing sheep You bought a gimmick with virtually no market support 

Im sure when youre hanging out outside the local playground all the little kids are super impressed by your folding phone"
They did throw money at app developers  at one point MS was offering a stipend of 10kUSD to anyone who shipped a WP8 app But the users werent there and 10k isnt enough to build an app so it went nowhere
I had the htc arrive which I loved Ended up switching to android back then because I couldnt get Snapchat on windows
The sad thing now is that with windows 1011 Windows apps are more of a thing and could definitely be implemented on a phone also
They couldnt afford to pay the kind of money that would take Developing an app for an entirely new platform and keeping it updated is a gigantic cost in most cases
"That was the sad part for sure Great future facing phone but hindered by the fact that you couldnt do what your friends were easily doing on their phones

Apples biggest draw is and pretty much always be the fact that they understand HOW people want to use their phones and then make that portion 10x easier than everybody else"
I love my series X so much Im a big apple guy but Microsoft absolutely killed it Amazing graphics speed and very quiet
The Zune HD is better than most phones today
Integrated messaging on windows phone was pretty much killed by advertising locking users into apps makes more opportunities for devs than just hanging off the ui to the is
Which is probably exactly why they named it that  to make it seem like it wouldnt make sense as anything else But it would
Were talking about the Dynamic Island feature not the cutout itself
A little not enough that it couldnt support the feature
Looking forward to my S23 upgrade next year with the Samsung Fluid IsleTM feature
"Xiaomi dev already start and pending approval httpstwittercomvvaiibhavstatus1568942825068445697s20twhLJvP83Alix8hzAv4Ymw

If it proves to be popular more would follow suit"
Oh who did something similar
Same except charging my phone i didnt plug it in for 3 years Transfer rate doesnt matter and charging speed is awesome enough on the 11pro with usbc to lightning
"When 90 of other gadgetsphoneslaptops are using it as a standard you should care One cable for everyone faster charging speeds much faster data rates USBC supports upto 40Gbps vs Lightings extremely slow 480Mbps

USBC is sometimes a bit of a mess as a standard but its superior to lightning in every single way including durability Ive gone through 4 lightning cables in the same time a USBC cable is still going strong

Lightning is very dated and whilst it was revolutionary back in 2012 it doesnt cut it anymore"
I suppose we will have to wait and see once unpaid for reviewers get them later this month
Thats been a major issue lately since USBC is just the port For all we know Apple could put out USBc with usb 2 speeds and push some new way to charge your phone and send data that has the USB 3 speeds to push the industry
And Apple didnt need to either yet here they are with something completely unique Cant track an Uber from that top bar on Android cant see music playing etc Its stupidly clever and they deserve credit here
Try google 
Its not them saying it Its where everyone in the smartphone business is headed Its written on the wall
Oh At the time it was the face recognition and screen size they got rid of the thick black edges and the fingerprint ID
Yes the feature is the quintessential example of what Apple does best Theyve implemented this feature with aesthetic and marketing in mind so gracefully Its honestly very impressive
You have to drag in that general area for notification center on all iphones that area gets touched regardless
So whats the excuse when they all just copy this feature next year
"google does this all the time theyre doing it even now with folding screens

Adding an interactive cutout as an option for OEMs who choose to go the cutout root should have been a high priority but google fumbled it"
"I thought it looked distracting when they showed full screen landscape video  The pill extends further into the screen than the notch which seems like a big downside to me  

All these new Dynamic Island features could have been applied to the notch perhaps Apple prototyped a dynamic peninsula but I suppose that wouldnt drive iPhone pro sales so it wasnt a priority"
Not exactly Just glance over at videos and pictures of the pill shape and my eye instantly goes to that right away its also not the first phone to have a pill cutout Had it on the S10 and it was a bit distracting but got over it because its not as big as apples and it was pushed to the rope right away from most things
They also have to price in future minor fluctuations They add padding every year you never get direct US converted pricing
"Apple devices have always been pricier outside the US they didnt bump the price compared to last year only the Euro lost in value

You pay the extra 100 for logistics and longer warranty"
How can I tell someone I dont understand economics without telling them I dont understand economics
"It went from 1500 to 1610 not 1750 in comparison to the iPhone 13 Pro Do take into account the rupee is weaker it was 1USD  735INR now its 1USD  7975INR And this just applies to the Pro The iPhone 14 is launching at the same price as the iPhone 13

Funnily enough the 799 iPhone 14 is launching at 80k 1000 whereas the 799 Apple Watch Ultra is launching at 90k Guess thats the benefit of the iPhone 14 being made in India"
I didnt catch that part  did they remove the sim tray this year
Apple products have always been pricier outside the US Nothing changed this year
"With tax excluded I get a difference of about 40 1299 Phone 20 Tax

1299  08  10392"
"Only 5 states dont have sales tax and those states have more tax on other things

You pay vat in the eu to pay for healthcare and better transit your paying more for your iPhone to pay for those nice societal benefits"
"So youd pay for a service and extra shipping costs to buy in a state with no sales tax

To save maybe 50 at most after paying the extra shippingservice fees

And its technically breaking state law"
It doesnt change the fact that VAT has not changed but phones got price increase
"Interest rates raise by Fed has only started in March 2022 yet the deprecation of EUR to USD is happening for almost 15 year now The EUR was relatively strongest around June 2021 but since then the decline is steady and somewhat constant Its perfectly aligned first with the resolution of COVID troubles in the US and then the European energy crisis caused by Russia in late 2021 and continuing on through 2022 escalated with the start of war in Ukraine

Sorry to disappoint you and debunk your opinion but its not interest rates"
Its 1449 in Germany for the base model 1099  210 VAT is 1310 Instead its 1449
Thats specifically for ProRes you can record normal 4K  60fps just fine on 128gb
Meh I cant think of a single situation that Id use 4K recording in that would make a difference
I too would like to get more things without paying extra for them but something tells me thats an unrealistic expectation Especially when inflation and the cost of doing business is absolutely through the roof
Oh I do ive just filled my 200GB because of it haha 130 GB icloud photos shrunk to 20 GB local
Really Is that just the regular 14 or the Pro too My 12 Pro can record 4k 243060
Well I use it when I dont have access to a PClaptop and for things I can only do on the phone Why would I want to watch Youtube on the small screen of my phone if I have a PClaptop with a big screen and working adblocker nearby
Gotcha Im still on regular 11 and havent kept up with the updates Good to know its that high on refresh Interested in this MagSafe as well
They kept it and it goes down to 1Hz refresh now for static content
Yeah looking now Looks like a decent upgrade for me
"My dad uses a MagSafe mount in his Wrangler and it doesnt fall off so Id say its unlikely

x200B

Might be hard to fit in your pocket though They dont give a good picture of how thick it is on the website"
The magnet on this isnt that strong It comes off all the time I do not have a similar issue with my car mount
"Ah gotcha

Yeah it seems like a decent enough bump from the 12 series but not quite the 13 series"
69
"Just because you never leave your basement doesnt mean other people dont 

If the 2000 peak brightness is automatic for outside ambient light and the ambient light doesnt change for an hour how does it dictate to finally dim If it activates because of a setting you are in and that setting doesnt change is it just a timed setting Thats all Im curious about you fucking asshole"
You think Apple screens are somehow better Have you actually compared them
I know that I mean why did the user Im responding to think Samsung cant design a screen
Well it certainly looks stupid on the notched phones haha
It is still cheaper in the US even if you add AppleCare for two years that also includes accidental damage and theft
The fact that sales tax in New York is lower than in EU isnt Apple fault
Well the pro is not the same as the pro max either
"I think that difference was always the case I remember that the EU prices were always more expensive than just adding the VAT  
Maybe some kind of importexport taxes between EUUSA "
Eu phones have longer warranty due to laws
They have to price to the unstable exchange rate they cant just calculate the sale price on the current exchange rate they have to stick to the same pricing for a long time so they add a buffer for if the Euro drops more which is likely
Eu has more taxes than the us Also eu iPhones have longer warranty due to laws
"Didnt say you did just blame your currency not Apple

Im not a fan of Apple but theyve done nothing wrong here"
The fuck are you talking about Literally everything in Europe has become more expensive
Yeah if youre poor lol
"To be fair the only significant reasons for any flaw that Apples engineers have failed to overcome so far are marketing and profit

Random guys on YouTube can hack it together but some of the best engineers havent figured out a proper implementation in the 5 years people have been asking for it While their chips and software already have the support

Its honestly insulting that such talented people are wasted on tasks like make sure this doesnt run with the case open and remove the top bit of the notch that didnt have camera under it anyway instead of actual innovation"
Using the ATT upgrade seems like a no brainer Ill be trading in my 13 Pro for the 14 Pro for free lol
Im the type of person to keep my phone 34 years at this point For me it just makes sense to wait until USBC is on the iPhone so that theres nothing else I would want from a phone and would allow me to ride out my iPhone for several years If it werent for that upcoming I would just keep my 12PM and do annual battery swaps its still an amazing phone to me and no other upgrades interest me
always on displays dropping to 1hz is only recent though
Not a good enough reason to not include it 20Hz is plenty low enough
"You seem to be working off the assumption that removing the notch was an option It wasnt For 95 of people losing face ID andor having a dramatic decrease in front camera quality arent acceptable tradeoff for a notch less screen 

Given that some form of notchpillcutout is mandatory this is just about the best possible way they couldve done it Those notifications would have to occupy screen space anyways And there would be useless space in the notification bubble for aesthetic reasons By combining the pill and the notification area the dead space of the pill can be utilized as the aesthetic dead space of the notification bubble"
This entire post is an ad Every comment says the same thing How could anyone actually think this is useful
Sure but the dead space now is negligible There just wont be notifications and stuff in that spot
Well the pill is already there instead of the notch So theyre utilizing the space
That or apple haters just need to not pretend like they carry around cords having too many cords is a nuisance or that cords really go beyond your desk andor bedside
Make Lightning 20 then USBC is too bulky for a thin phone
Thats okay it still works
And again obviously I know we need to use two hands to reach the dynamic crap The holy grail is to use one hand even for a big phone and apple crapped on it
Im confused there IS a camera hole there For 3 camerassensors
"I think youre confused

The TrueDepth camera system present in the notch has been replaced with the Dynamic Island pill shape in the new phones

That black pill shape is always going to be a void in the display area because hardware components are there The front facing camera and FaceID dot projector and illuminator are there No way around it

What Apple has done is to cleverly use software to disguise the TrueDepth camera system by integrating it as part of the UI to now be an interactive notifications element"
From a X You cant be serious Even a X to 13 pro would have been a massive jump in terms of battery performance display brightness 120 Hz screen size bezels LIDAR 5G and yes the cameras
Im traveling to Colombia next February for a wedding and their regional carrier offers eSIM so I will opt for that
Have you not thought about an SE of some kind
"Im happy with it Much better than just having it drain and not having a clue if your at 15 or 25 

Cant be begging choosers with apple Im just glad they finally brought it back"
Apple litteraly dose the same they copy Samsung alot too
"Today the euro is pretty much equal in value to the US dollar
The iPhone 14 Pro Max costs 1499  in the Finnish apple store The strength of the dollar is not the reason

edit and thats the cheapest one If you want the top model itll cost you 214900  which in todays exchange rate would translate to 214104 US Dollars"
especially next year they will have finally a SD inside here in 3rd world Germany
"Lol I didnt say they are integrated into the screen

I said that they are under the screen which means that you can use the same protectors for iPhone 111213

You can even touch the dynamic island didnt you see the presentation"
"I am perfectly able to use the phone one handed now and will be able to do so with the dynamic island as well

Youre not making any points just repeating the same thing If youre talking about large phones they will inevitably require two hands at least for some tasks Thats why I dont get the Plus or Max phones"
"Agreed One of my biggest gripes with the 13 Pro Max right now is how difficult it is to read the display while Im outside in full sun

And the 13 Pro Max was previously the brightest display champion on an iPhone

Cant imagine how users of older models even read anything on their phones when outdoors"
Spoiler alert nobody cares
Yes but youll have to pay full price If you want to trade in store youll have to go to the Apple Store on release day and trade it in
Well what speeds you get when you are connected wireless to any satellites
Its called rif for reddit now Admins made them change the name
Thanks
I mean you specifically compared it to apollo A reddit client that is known to only work on iOS That could have been a hint
Sure Perhaps youd do better to direct this at uiamthatis himself instead of passiveaggressively commenting at a stranger about it
Do you  When was the last time anything of value was added 
"Well good job youve comme across exactly one dev 

	It doesnt matter if you think the features arent useful They obviously are

One icon is enough I dont find adding more of them really useful 

	The app is smooth and the dev is very considerate in how and when he updates it

Last new icons 3 months ago newest icons before that  7 month ago He does put a lot of work on the changelogs and displays it on the first launch after an update thats why you feel that way 

But for exemple I maintain a website the display content for other website and one user notified me that redgifs stopped working one hour and a half later it was working again and it took that long because I took one hour to open that mail It is probably still broken on Apollo And mind you unlike him I wasnt notified 1 month prior and given the steps to follow to fix it Neither did they contacted me or gave me any help unlike him 

Maybe his iOS 16 update will be insane and make me lie but I highly doubt it well see next week"
Oh thanks for the sauce
Yeah then one of the founders that bled that ethos was facing life an herod and reddit became as corporate sellout as possible  and is that antithesis of its original ethos Unfortunately not enough people remember and the current userbase celebrates the removal of freeze peach
alienblue had some fucking sexy UI
swimming in the ocean causing a commotion
His design philosophy is to make a reddit app that feels like Apple made it I think he used to be an intern at Apple too Hes great at making use of every feature Apple adds
Where on earth do you work that developer time is being utilized so efficiently that 9 cumulative weeks of developer time is a blip on anyones radar Facebook who has taken years and billions of dollars to develop a shittier version of VR Chat Google who is renowned for abandoning products and recently had two competing video chat applications with the same name Massive companies routinely waste years of developer time
My dads not a cellphone Duh
Maybe its a difference across models Im trying on a 12 mini and it only fails if I aim above the speaker grill Even tapping the grill itself works The screen area is barely more sensitive  if I tap the space above the WiFi icon for example it sometimes doesnt register
Id honestly rather have the notch be smaller and have everything come down from the notch  I think that would look smoothercooler  The notch would always be the hub of the phone
The island does seem touch sensitive I was wondering about that too httpstcolmo3Qrg32s
Absolutely is indeed a poor choice of word here  it could convey the notion that the notch is entirely sensitive or that its precise enough for supporting multiple actions But the point was that the same taptoscroll that already works due to the lower area could in theory be used for other actions though I still consider it a bad idea for the other reasons mentioned
Yes but why would someone want to have it
"1 They are locking it Pretending like this would only work with the new notch and not the old one is incredibly foolish They could have had this feature in any phone Of course it wouldnt work without the hardware being there Its called using the screen to allow you to interact with your phone


2 Its notifications Nothing more Havent had an iphone for some time but youve always been able to interact with notifications Or at least you can on android"
The DIs main job is multi tasking and quickly keeping relevant apps on screen at all times we DO NOT have a current equivalent you can keep saying banners do this but they dont at all
This reads like a copypasta
You couldnt even respond to the correct comment and you want to talk about understanding features
This is a weird hill to die on You can obviously tell they used notch to mean broadly the part of the screen with the camera on it The fact that a hole isnt a notch is not important to the meaning of their comment
"Its not about preventing the touch its about herding the touch

The dynamic island encourages the user to touch the camera area

The current notch herds touches AWAY from the notch and off to the screen areas that are on either side of the notch"
Exactly this
Android didnt try under display cameras only niche Chinese companies like Huawei did that Android has been embracing the punch hole camera with a black notification bar to make it blend in for maximum space
Bang on  As much as Apple is raving about this major feature theyll be just as excitedly telling you how amazing it is that they got their invisible FaceID hardware working or what not  They always do what they can to sell their limitations   There are minimal animations and things with the hole punch devices ie when video calling or taking a selfie etc
"Honestly the iPhone is the only thing I dont care about having a notch because of Face ID 

When they when pin hole I thought it was going to be stupid until they revealed dynamic island today That shit made my 13 pro max feel instantly outdated Apple really knows how to make a good software experience"
This While the animations look sick they could have already done all this with the notch Technically it doesnt add anything to the ecosystem It does streamline the UX of notifications plus active applications though Some active applications already display around the notch like when theres an active call They mostly brought it all together with animations and a consistent visual language
No the dynamic island is a multi tasking tool the current phones do not do this the notification area is entirely different
Not a single person associates swipe up gesture controls with the palm on webos lmao
"Youre correct The rest of the industry is trying their best to reduce the real estate taken up by front facing hardware via small punch hole type cutouts or under screen cameras on the most cutting edge devices I doubt anyone will copy
exactly this since going back to a larger part of the display being unavailable would be seen as a regression 

What may happen if this is really popular is certain manufacturers trying to integrate the notch into the UX more and make it interact with the software instead of just being in the way"
"Its just a really clever use of the data they r gotten from watch complications Developers can utilize the SDK to build these meaningful complications built into that island that can display information 

Its just super clever and really unified with the system"
"Theres nothing really innovative about it and anyone that tells you different is a fanboy Most of the rest of the industry is moving away from notches all together Everyone else is either chasing the elusive under screen camera that until now nobody can seem to nail down yet or minimizing cutouts dedicated to cameras as much as possible via hole punch design

This is just Apple adding a bit of functionality to something that as you said is dead space that until now is kind of in the way and no one interact with except when taking a selfie or using Face ID"
"I can see your perspective of it honestly  
I dont understand the position of being deceived by Apple though Do you think Apple is trying to trick you into thinking that the cutout isnt there They arent deceiving you theyre trying to make use of the space and geometry as much as possible  
  
With the dynamic island you have more access to quick controls that wouldnt feel as natural and seamless on the current notched iPhones Thats all no deception or lies lol"
Excellent
That isnt happening like ever lol
How tiny the pills you be taking that you think thats a giant pill
You realize that this is just a black space around a pinhole cutout right
Exactly
What do you mean under the screen On the back
"No not really My looks can probably benefit from the extra soft filter from my finger print smudges 

People on this sub take any hint of criticism way too seriously it was just a simple reflection on the ux choice"
That would have worked out great in search results Get Timothy on the phone
Dynamic Dingamabob
MKBHD uses 189 and it fits below the notch perfectly Not sure what youre talking about unless youre zooming in on the videos
Nice double down on you your ignorance
"I dont even get what youre criticizing at this point

	The island is just the new notch

Again no shit Its literally an updated notch 

	Apple could 100 fix this

Fix what"
Please learn how to spell their
Having social media send you notifications is an insanely bad idea in almost all circumstances
TikTok and Instagram are lost causes but you can avoid all advertising and algorithmic timelines by using a thirdparty app with Reddit
"It is against App Store guidelines to push marketing via notifications if the user has opted out But Apple wont remove Uber and Grubhub for violating the rules for ome reaon 

httpsdeveloperapplecomforumsthread76308"
"	I get notifications for friends posting stories 

Its really fun when youre doing patient care and suddenly your friends bikiniclad ass pops up on your wrist"
On android most do
Yes an external hump is a much better option s
The proximity sensor is under the display The hole punch is just for the camera and the dot projector
Its more like a widget than a notification
Basically Its just a sleek way of hiding the components as a notification bar
The middle of it between the Camera and the Face ID sensors will have either green or orange lights to indicate microphone and or camera is being used
The others phones notches are too big to really take advantage of this I dont have a problem with it
"Unlike Apple most manufacturers got rid of the notch within a generation

Other manufacturers did this by switching to a hole punch and making it as small as possible leaving much more room for notifications and other icons Theres no need for a dynamic island if your island is 4mm in diameter

Other manufacturers are already hiding the front camera altogether behind a transparent oled screen

Apple is behind on this not ahead"
You are genuinely missing something
You said you dont know what it does And No ones avoiding saying that If you look the comments like the one youre responding to are that its a really cool way to hide the notch thats it If you dont like it thats completely understandable but its a pretty sleek trick to hide the notch components and I much prefer it to what we currently have
Thats fair I think its pretty hard as is to use one handed I dont think will add or detract from it but I cant imagine using it on a max or plus size phone
Ohh thats a good point but tbf in mrwhoesthebosses test all the phones were almost at full brightness
Findthen we shall talk And just video playback doesnt count Mixed use Oh and not special phones just meant for good battery
Bigger capacity does not mean better battery
"Lol ok 

Ill take your word for it "
Went or going with
I dont share my phone with idiots like I do on the road
End result is completely different Death vs broken screen that you can fix for a few hundred bucks
I think so not really feeling the purple
Haha thanks No worries I figured it was an obscure reference when I commented but I couldnt resist myself
Video is one of the reasons I switch to iPhone It is almost as good as a high end mirrorless but always with me
Its pretty much the only reason it ever seems worth upgrading
Yea imagine having a better phone Maybe next year you get lucky and Apple loses the notch completely you guys will catch up eventually
Lol
Hey its OK Youll be all about it when Apple folds
Yea but th3 just is that you can still see yourself using the front screen and main cameras You can use s mirror with the iphone to see yourself I guess lol
Oh my bad misunderstood
True the 3d map stuff is definitely more complex but that makes me wonder if theres a YouTube video comparing both of them and if the 3d map is worth the notch Never had the samsung face ID fail me but Ill definitely have to try an iPhone
My large national bank doesnt even implement 2FA tokens U2F or webauth Banks especially their software are years behind apps considered inconsequential like Facebook I wouldnt bank on banks being the software security gurus
Exactly They should add an in screen fingerprint reader or put it on the back or side and then they dont NEED faceID sensors
They could have just had it act the same as the notch but smaller Instead they made use of the extra space by having UI elements thereand they integrated it with the pill so that it doesnt feel quite so out of place
Thats super cool and I love that Thanks for explaining
Right but were talking about software here 3rd party wont know about software features unless its super tied to the hardware
Hence now notch 20
How do you black out the sides
I will bet my left nut they will copy it in their next update
Android already has a pretty great notification system they dont need to do this Plus the camera cutout on the S21S22 is already tiny it wouldnt make sense to do something like this The camera cutout just takes up a tiny portion of the middle of the status bar at the top
Yeah for example the hole bunch has a little white circle that goes around it to draw your eyes attention when its doing its face unlock But thats about it

Like what phone Dont think its going away soon
"Xiaomi dev already start and pending approval httpstwittercomvvaiibhavstatus1568942825068445697s20twhLJvP83Alix8hzAv4Ymw

If it proves to be popular more would follow suit Its software dont overly focus on the shape of the cutout"
Just wait for their next year model suddenly everyone will implement the feature
Apple is stuck with the notch because they went all in on faceID and they are too obsessed with branding Apple will be the last phone manufacturer to have a notch and in a few years the only one with a visible front facing camera
Android could put a black blob notification window that would do the same as the magic island except that it can also go completely away when not in use I am really not seeing what is so special about this feature
Its quite bold to call it a glaring flaw when its because they want to keep FaceID
To be fair they couldve done the same thing with a notch And it wouldve taken less screen real estate
How is it more useful
Yeah
I dont know Im literally tapping the notch on my 13P and it works Maybe a small surface of my finger is touching the display slightly but if thats the case then for all intents and purposes its basically tapping the notch
Guess Im gonna have to start taking crazy pills then because thats how I use mine
I tried right now it does work on iPhone X as long as you dont touch the speaker The finger is larger that the notch
Can anyone tell me why in the US the price has stayed the same while in Europe it has raised by 200 EUR
"What redesign bro it looks exactly the same 

	Im not allowed to like the redesign

Im not your mom i dont care Im just sharing my opinion like you are yours"
Tarting it up with these vacuous words doesnt remove the fact that its a punch hole with some notifications
Then give the other tech
Not if you fill the screen and decapitate the subjects
I think it just shows how many people use core functionality for basic uses vs people that are power users Obviously both are valid to an extent but the basic users shouldnt really be slating the power users D
Honestly Im waiting for Apple to bribe their way into just ignoring the EU regulations
att is making it so you have to upgrade or add a new line what if we  already have unlimited and dont need a new line just no deal
Absolutely If Im out and I cant watch my favorite team Im gonna use the extra real estate to see the live score
Arent those just floating widgets Or is this a different thing Last time I used an Android device it was on Oreo many years ago
Talk to me when youre able to place apps anywhere on the screen and not where Apple wants you to place them slave lol
Stop trying to talk sense into these people they drank the marketing koolaid
But the feature revolves around the new notch design This is one of the very few times it actually makes sense to limit it to the newest iPhone
Not so sure about that space up there is tight adding UI elements to the sides of the pill without blocking the stuff thats already up there is tough Millimeters matter
"httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsideuchainfireholeylighthlenUSglUShttpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsideuchainfireholeylighthlenUSglUS

Theres a lot of solutions from independent development teams on android devices

Yes its not as complex as what a multibillion dollar UI team developed but it is effectively turning useless space into a beacon for notifications the same way the Dynamic Island works

Its enough that I wouldnt call apple the one to come up with the idea but they are definitely the first manufacturer to release this feature into their stock phones and its outrageously improved compared the solution I linked above"
"Did you not see the part where the pill is being touched to display more info

Im not saying that the pill has pixels or something like that"
"For charging it doesnt matter if that is your primary concern 

If you shoot video for fun or semi professionally then you want high speed data transfer Who would want to wait hours to get a TB of data off your phone Apple pushes the cinematography aspect of their phones too much to have a data port so slow"
"Lighting doesnt feel dated at all to me it feels physically better and more solid than USBC

My AirPods are still on Lightning and my laptop uses MagSafe so Im nowhere near an all USBC future and I dont really care tbh Ive never had a problem with the amount of cables I carry around"
Yep nailed it I do like the physical design of the lightning port but when all my devices except for AirPods and iPhone run on USBC I really look forward to when I can ditch all lightning cables
The island is enticing but no USBC is a huge deal  Might still wait another year or two until they finally add it
"It would be hilarious if they go USBC on the phone as power only no data at all

And some 60ghz solution on the MagSafe port with pucks that support USBC  USB 4 or 10gbps Ethernet or whatever"
You cant I can see skip pause favorite all from my top bar on android when listening to music And while it doesnt show a map it still gives me details on when my uber driver will be here Its cool but not new
Or you could tell me
"Ah got itits just assumptions then and not something Apple actually said

It seems equally as plausible that Apple doesnt want to move to an uninterrupted full screen device as the notch is something that sets their brand apart making it obvious someone has an iPhone Like the same way only ever made their earbuds in white so it was obvious someone had an iPod same now with AirPods and looks like what theyre trying to do with the dynamic island

Also the iPhone has only existed for 15 years now and the notch has been around for 5 years of that and will continue for at minimum another year Not much of a stop gap"
You touch your touchscreen Eww
"I think itll be harder to just copy than you think Theres lots of different Android ORM developers and they dont all have the ability or resources to implement the same thing Its a huge effort to implement something like this when youre also actively trying to get rid of the cutout altogether Animation like this in general is also much harder to do on Android

Its hard to do at the base Android layer since theres so many Android phones that all have different cutout implementations Some are in the middle Some are on the right or left corners of the screen etc

This is one benefit of Apple being the sole manufacturer of iOS devices in that they control the hardware design so can tailor the OS design to it"
I dont care Let them copy it all of it The more competition the better
Logistics of carrying it from china to us to Europe
"Apple has 1 year of warranty here i germany which is half of literally any other smartphone brand

The price is baaad imho Esp with how stingy apple is with special sales and price drops"
100 Were paying 350 more for the Max
lol gtf off your high horse Do you deny that Apples pricing is insanely greedy Even taking VAT and usdeur parity into account there is still a 10 price difference for no reason whatsoever
On US models https9to5maccom20220907iphone14esimonly
The price changed While they kept the same price in the US they increased the price substantially in EU and UK
"12 Pro was 1179 at release Same for 13 Pro

14 Pro is 1349"
Thats not how percentages work though If you add 20 to the price you calculated you dont get 1299 The math is 1299  112  10825
And even then its still not enough since the US covers almost all their military costs and they still pay around 50 income tax even more in some countries Germany France and Italy are slow walking aid to Ukraine because their economies are so pathetically dependent on russian gas while the US and UK keep NATO afloat on their own The US warned these euro countries about depending so much on russian oilLNG and idiots like Merkel laughed and dismissed those warnings
"Ive lived in multiple countries and I know all that Im not talking about how silly or inconsistent or a shell game sales and income taxes are in that bonkers country where I was born 

None of that changes the fact that millions of Americans see a price and just pay it therefore it would never make sense to include VAT theres no such thing there they call it state sales tax in prices in the USA In some states one might include sales tax but its just not the cultural norm kind of like youre expected to tip more than anywhere in the developed world for things"
Take a look at how the euro compares to the dollar now and a year ago
"Cant say why for that case specifically Theres probably a variation of situations costs and laws that have an effect on a country per country basis

But clearly some country that are part of the European Union are paying less"
Good point after all is said and done Apple is just a struggling small business trying to make ends meet
MagSafe was first introduced in the 12 models I personally love it I use it everyday honestly from just charging it at home or just attaching the MagSafe battery pack to my phone daily to keep it around 9091 I do this at work and usually when it dies my phone still has like 90 left near the end of my shift It helps preserves battery cycles too

Youre asking to be spoon fed answers when you dont even know the fundamentals Google would be a good start"
Not that they cant I just dont think they do it as well Im talking about the fact that Apple will do something like curve the screen at the bottom of the phone to get maximum coverage Dont see anyone else doing that
European redditors realizing their robust governmental oversight comes with a cost lol
I meant Pro Max
Its a bunch of things including import costs but also value of the Euro in this case
Im blaming Apple Richest company in the world they should have eaten the cost not me
"Funny i dont see a big price increase in any of samsungs or xiaomis new releases Or new tvs or other hardware

But sure defend a 15k regular ass 14pm Poor Apple sure needs to sqeeze evry bit of money"
Lmao you foul for this 
Yeah Id totally just do a battery upgrade if it wasnt for the att bonus
"Yeah ok Ive been happy on an 11 pro First time Ive waited more than 2 years since the first iPhone I think Ill be moving to 4 years after I get the 14 pro  

I still dont find the usbc so compelling partially because you can still use usbc chargers and I have so many lightning cables already But yeah practically every other electronic I have is usbc now"
Ayyy Americans it saddens me to think what you used to be and how we see you nowyour culture is flawed No Nipples or the f words allowed but killings in schools you should check the amount of American moving to Europe and I am sure is more than the other way around haha also Tesla If you want a good car you buy a Mercedes bmw Ferrari etc testa is a side note in the history of carsbut keep thinking you are the best country in the world is working great for you guys hahahahaha
Thank you dr
None of them have the entire screen alwayson like the iphone 14 pro does
Instead of left or right of the pill do it left or right of the notch Theres just a bit of screen between the camera and the edge now
When I fly I have to pack usbc lightning and the Apple Watch charger The cables get tangled together in my bag and its a total pain in the ass Im not buying anything new unless it supports usbc 6S gang
The Galaxy Z Flip 3 was very thin and still worked with USBC Thinner than the iphone when opened so it can be done
Not the point but ok
" I think youre confused

Maybe Mind helping me out In the video I saw a changing shape How do they achieve this Because the hardware doesnt change shape  
How do they disguise the TrueDepth camera system by integrating it as part of the UI I dont mean how its coded I mean what are they actually doing Because I understood that they blacken parts that arent normally blackened by hardware components"
"I still think the iPhone is an exceptional product and the best phone on the market for my needs All I am saying is as a tech enthusiast and software developer that I am pretty tired of the camera being the main selling point every year

The iPhone X was mind blowing when it dropped on all aspects both software and hardware The past 5 generations after that combined probably make the same difference the iPhone X did on its own cycle"
"You defend Apple why You really think they couldnt easily have put USBC on this years iPhone They could definitely put touch ID on the iPhone or make it Apple Pencil compatible Literally 90 of the keynote focused on the camera like every year

 Tell me one way that LIDAR is currently revolutionary for the average user that isnt photography focused

 So you are saying the bezel difference between the X and 14 is revolutionary

 The change from display brightness is revolutionary and a game changer between the X and 14

The dynamic island is NOT a revolutionary hardware change nor is it extremely innovative its smart software integration but that was needed as a result of poor progress in physical hardware to remove the cutout entirely"
"A different sensor to make a graph of coordinates on your face and compare it to its database In other words the exact same system android uses

best processor nope Qualcomm has always had the lead

best software the one that makes you pay for everything and gives you no say in what you do with it

best cameras no The sensors themselves are nowhere near as good as some in other phones

You are paying a premium for the Apple logo and go get ripped of when you buy it when you damage it and when you need to buy apps You are paying extra for the right to buy one of the most common phones on the market made by a company that has admitted to making their phones slower and have less battery over time on purpose

If I wanted to feel superior Id buy a Rolex Heck Id buy a Samsung flipfold"
I was thinking the old SE at least itll have 6S insides
"Pretty much every new feature on iPhones over the last several years existed on Android first NFC wireless charging high refresh rate AOD customizable lock screens widgets app library the ability to choose your own default apps just to name a few

I could keep going There are absolutely instances of apple creating something new and cool and other manufacturers borrowing it like im sure will happen with dynamic animations around a front facing camera because thats cool as hell but there are far more examples of the opposite and those borrowed features from android being far more impactful"
"Lol Mannn you got me   

Some of you guys sure get heated in here"
I dont think Apple really mocked that though and theyre were clearly hesitant on going phablet in the first place But yeah I get you Samsung just seems where more blatant with it thought out the years imo
"Yes so given VAT youd expect the number value to be higher

Not sure why you added the most expensive version Its also more expensive in the US you know"
"Theyre not under the screen either which is exactly what I meant And no you cant use the same screen protector for those iPhones on this because most screen protectors for those iPhones have cutouts in them for the notch The speaker location is also different on the 1112 compared to the 13 

You have no idea what youre talking about"
No shit we have to use two hands at some point And no you dont get to say you use your phone perfectly with one hand then go on to say some require two hands Youre hopeless Gtfoh lmao
I dont have monkeypox but from the way you think react and type sounds like you have some deficiencies I suggest you see someone about that You have a sad life ahead of you if not already
"Depends on the device The car on the driveway which only supports 25GHz obviously doesnt get as good reception but it would be worse on a dualband single WiFi 6E router due to distance and interference partly because I have a satellite near the front of the house and the main router is in the back where my coax comes in

You can argue about specs all you want but realworld setups can be complicated If you live in a tiny apartment where one router works its easier but a bigger house with 6 residents and devices spread throughout the house is better served by a mesh network

So youre saying that 2000 is a worthy upgrade even though more than 50 of my devices dont support WiFi 6e"
Appreciate the correction
Passive aggressive I dont see anywhere where I was aggressive toward you Simply stating that Apollo needs house cleaning and giving examples isnt aggressive Its merely a wish that the dev would be more excited to clean things up
"Yeah as a developer and long time user I want to know whats going on Most recently custom subreddit watchers  reminders are pretty cool Would I use this particular feature Probably not but there are definitely types of users who would And its cool to have that option if I did need  want it

The semirecent one I use the most is probably the option to open links in reader mode by default keeps everything nice and dark across the entire app experience My favorite feature is probably hard tap to save any video  gifs  etc in a single click Super useful"
Tbf it looks nothing like an Applemade app but still a great app miles better than the default Reddit app
You dont have a damn clue what youre talking about armchairquarterbacking large companies
You know Apple will use that shot of the iPhone hitting the ground for its Ceramic Shield feature highlight
"Its not about models The notch is not touch sensitive in any iPhone You have to tap the screen below the notch or on either side of the notch where the time or battery indicator is displayed

What you maybe experiencing is that when youre trying to aim below the speaker grill part of your finger is also coming in contact with the screen"
Dynamic Island equivalency is available on the Minis Nice
Tap on time to scroll all the way up
Yeah its kinda alright if you look at it from a what else can we do with this ugly thing since were not getting rid of it perspective
"Its not for notifications Its for things running in the background So like if your music is playing it displays an icon or when your airpods are connected its a place for the battery percentage or when youre waiting for your Uber its a shortcut back to the Uber app or when a timer is running the time remaining can remain on screen while youre in another app It persistently lives on your screen The current notch isnt narrow enough to let you fit this information PLUS the status bar information that users currently have

Its hardware locked insofar as meaning that its limited to phones where theres enough screen real estate to fit this info Phones with a notch dont have the space Phones with this hole punch do have the space Keep in mind the hole punch is tiny compared to the notch In fact Apple is using software to make it appear larger than what it physically is in hardware Theres even pixels in the middle of the notch that are left off except for privacy indicators"
dude you said it has nothing to do with notifications Its job is to notify you of info from other apps It has a broader function than regular notifications but we cant pretend like its not just the notifcations  some extra stuff
believe what you want but I am simply a person tired of talking to people who do not understand why a notch and a hole are different things
"who do you think Im replying to

I was most directly responding to this statement  


Samsung flagship had a better looking notch almost 4 years ago"
"I can obviously tell they used the word notch in a way that is not accurate  If you cant even use words correctly how can I expect you to form opinions correctly  An update to a design would likely appear meaningless to someone who doesnt know the meaning behind the words they use

If they said The Pixel flagship had a better looking hole almost 4 years ago and posted the same link to a Samsung phone would you overlook that its actually a Samsung phone shown instead of a Google Pixel phone because its not important to the meaning behind their comment"
And dynamic island still doesnt encourage you to touch the camera because its a camera again its still a non issue you can literally prove it yourself touch the camera then open the app behold as a grand total of nothing interesting happens
How long has the galaxy fold had the underdisplay camera
My fold has an under display camera it sucks but its there
The Galaxy fold used it also
The Galaxy Fold has an under screen camera Thats hardly a niche Chinese company
"Huawei is not niche lol 

And a lot of companies have now under display camera offerings"
Ironically Huawei is the only company that still use large notch like iPhone in their latest Mate 50 Pro have iPhone 14 Pro big pill in their last year Mate 40 Pro and never have smartphone with underdisplay camera
Im glad ive held onto my XS for so long 14 pro here we come
It does add a lot its literally a multi tasking bar we do not have that currently on iPhone
Basically their complaint is it works at being seamless enough that the hardware is less noticeable at a glance but on second look when I notice its actually there Im mad that they tried to hide it and it works for a moment 
Yeah because Android manufacturers NEVER mindlessly copied the iPhone UI and hardware
"Apples cutout is larger and shaped differently to others That why folks are calling it pill shaped

Other companies will make their cutout bigger to look like Apple"
No invisible under the screen check out underscreen cameras There are some Android phones that have them but not good enough for Apple yet
You are completely right My memory was suggesting that it would wrap around the notch but you are completely correct it only does that while zooming in
Was I supposed to care
"Would the user experience be better with a full screen or a partial screen

Apple could choose to make a full screen iPhone they choose not to so that they can make sure everyone knows that they have have an iPhone when looking at the front"
Yeah its crazy Im not entirely sure why iOS apps dont do it but I know its definitely possible as messaging apps can discern groups or single notifications But it could very well be that iOS notification types are very limited
Just throw it all in a pop socket s
Youre welcome to your opinion but theres no reason it couldnt work
" The others phones notches are too big to really take advantage of this

Maybe on the 1012 but the 13 has a ton of useless wasted space on the sides of the notch If they felt like it they 100 could have added it to the older iPhones Same with the alwaysondisplay

The newer phones are pretty much just as capable as the old ones hardwarewise so Apple has been more and more artificially restricting new features with software The island thing is genius if you think about it its literally just software but it makes the 14 Pro actually look new and interesting"
Show me the other phones with equivalent face recognition again
"Moto Z Play  iPhone 13 Pro Max
  
at battery life Worse at literally everything else"
Fair enough I took it for granted that we were talking about onscreentime for different phones
Whats your average screen time
I did the preorder thing that apple lets you do where you preload all the options you want and just have to click authorize and I selected the 1tb deep purple pro max
your car doesnt normally have a ton of easily accessible vertical gravitational momentum either
Meh my lg v60 can hold its own Not the best but people are always saying how good my videos look
Id rather have a solid front camera than a shitty behind the screen camera tbh
Because when apple folds the technology will be ready and theyll do it right
Not on my buddys ZFold 4 The front screen turns off when you unfold it and the inner tablet screen turns on
No worries Under screen cameras will get there but theyll never really be as good as a normal camera Thats just physics Cameras work by gathering light and thats pretty much entirely what a screen is lol So theyre always going to pick up some of that light from the screen and cause issues Post processing will be able to fix a lot of it but will never quite get it the same
Ive left reddit because of the API changes
"I havent had a Samsung since the 8 so I dont know how much they improved it or not but it failed all the time for me I would have to open my eyes stupid wide and stare exactly at the same spot on the camera or it would tel me it didnt recognize me 

My pixel 4 Face ID was virtually identical to my iPhone pretty sure they used the same kind of sensors and it also had the notch"
All of those arent as secure as FaceID
Cant wait for 30 which is under display fingerprint and a hole punch camera that doesnt need all the UI weirdness
You cant devs can
The difference for camera cutout size is that apple has fully embraced Face ID so it needs space for those extra sensors I imagine it wouldve been a small punch hole too if it was just the front camera
God I loved that function
This onehttpsztedevicescomenusaxon40ultra
"Yeah Xiaomi and a couple of the other Chinese Android OEMs are kind of infamous for copying Apple As in their Android skins are blatant rip offs of iOS 

I have a hard time seeing others copying it though I could see them maybe making status bar content more dynamic or something though"
What feature Most other flagship phones have smaller camera holes and many will probably switch to underscreen cameras So there is nothing to copy here
"True but think of it in terms of UX the pill looks like a button is designed with the same corners as the screens and the buttons and looks like something you can tap

Tapping the notch would just be a hidden feature It doesnt call itself out The animations from the pill look like the widgets so it creates the right mental expectation Again the notch wouldnt fit that mental concept and would simply be weird"
"Basically it acts as a persistant widget bar and adjusts based on what needs to be displayed

For example its a media player control when your listening to stuff a notification area when a message comes in and an alert when youre watching for an Uber Things like that

Really its extremely well done imo Now if they could just carry that over to the notification center in general thatd be cool"
did you see how it works
More useful than the existing notch As you saw in the presentation itll blend in more seamlessly
When I tap the notch on my 13 Pro Max it does nothing  I have to tap slightly underneath it  I have pretty fat fingers too
Clicking on anything along the top works The notch isnt special
Try to use the tip of your finger and youll see it only responds when you touch under it
Well yeah because your finger is touching the screen around the notch The notch itself does not have touch sensors unlike the new iPhone
"1479 for the 256g model

Im not about to ask my boss for a phone that costs 1500 with a case"
Yeah and 1411 Euro in denmark  thats crazy for a phone in my opinion
Euro fell below the dollar
Basically an over reliance on Russian gas  weak ass ECB scared to raise rates
"Samsung Google Xiaomi etc Just look at their phones Apple is the only one that has a large enough restriction on the screen to bother working around it

Heres Samsung in 2019 with the S10 for example httpsmobilesdailypakistancompkwpcontentuploads202010s10jpg

Or a more recent one httpspriceinsouthafricacomwpcontentuploads202104SamsungGalaxyS22PriceinSouthAfrica768x768jpg"
OP was talking about having a format taller than 169 so the all mighty dynamic island didnt cut into the video so filling the screen is counterintuitive
It really ticks me off honestly that people think that if they dont use a feature nobody should or if they dont find a quirk in the OS annoying Like the total lack of middle click on the touchpad nobody should and anyone who does is just out to personally insult them because they tie their selfworth to the brand they prefer
"How so im sure they could have made it but it would require a lot more work to be done for other animations as islands animations wouldnt work for the notchor rather to look as nice and fluid

Plus thatd also mean twice as much work for third partys to incorporate and etc"
Thats how theyve designed it to look but it doesnt have to be an island it would work just as well as a peninsula Arguably better since the pixels above the island arent used
So independent dev team put in more work than major android makers All UX in corporate big brands manufacturers just doing nothing but waiting on Apple
Agreed Usb c on the other end was way more crucial It was ridiculous they didnt make the move when they removed all the type a ports in MacBooks
Like the guy below says we all definitely need to see a screenshot here Im not talking about pulling your notification shade down I mean in your notification bar
"	You cant I can see skip pause favorite all from my top bar on android when listening to music

can you post a screenshot i believe you i just dont remember this feature from when i had an S8"
Oh I thought they came out together oh well it was a while ago haha
"Not for next year models when they all follow this design pattern

That variation of different cutout exist as they all mindlessly experimenting without Apple After seeing this they would all follow suit and streamline for next year lineup"
Not if the competition just wait around to copy though Thats not competing to innovate but just waiting to steal
Dont have yet
"On release iPhones are typically delivered directly to Europe from Asia Later
On they usually come from the Czech Republic or the Netherlands as there are big hubs At least thats how I experienced it in the last few years"
Isnt it EU law to have 2 years of warranty no matter the product
"Its still a phenomenal product that will perform flawlessly for a year or more longer than any android to be honest

With the price bump the iphone 15 series is likely to get this one might seem cheap this time next year lol"
No Again US prices dont contain taxes
I dont know both my local Singaporean and Chinese pricing is constant between 13 and 14 models both the SGD and the CNY is stable against the USD too Apple couldve decided to be greedy internationally but for reason they decided to raise pricing in Europe only Hint the currencies are losing values against USD So probably look beyond Europe to find the problem first
The Euro is down 20 Thats your reason right there
The Euro lost 20 of value against USD in the past year They only adjusted the currency conversation rate
Do you not understand that the Euro lost 20 value against USD in the past year
Youre probably right I never really thought about how sales tax is added and just assumed that it is x of the final price instead x added to the price
Its not some states hat include a sales tax Its the vast majority Like 95 of the population has a sales tax Its a cultural norm Everyone knows what a sales tax is in the USA
"The fact is if they increased prices at the top tier they really wouldnt have taken much flak for it People were half expecting it 

The cost of just about everything that goes into that product  from labor to chips to gassing the planes that carry the product from the factories  has increased in the last 12 months Markedly in some cases 

Not saying apple should be praised for holding their pricing but lets all look around and acknowledge what is happening economically right now"
ProRes being gimped on any of the Pros isnt good they should have just dropped the 128 GB model
"I use it for my wallet and love it Its surprisingly strong as is but I have a clear case with the white ring with extra magnets that make it even more secure Get home and I pop the wallet off and set it on a MagSafe charging stand So seamless and easy I love it 

Thought about getting a MagSafe battery many times Much less efficient surebut so much easier and cooler No cables to deal with and dont have to worry about breaking the port when keeping it in a pocketbag while charging 

And I love that because its a uniform size any company can make accessories that just work I have a ShiftCam ProGrip kinda bulky but the new one just uses MagSafe to attach and thats awesome 

Im even working on my own MagSafe grip to sell on Etsy right now using magnets for it I got on Amazon JoyCon controller grip because of iOS 16 specifically supporting them that just attaches with MagSafe Even my crappy prototype feels cool because of the magnets"
Samsung does that just on the sides instead of the bottom
It doesnt cost that much more money And the 2 year warranty requirement has existed magnitudes longer than even the prototype iPhone 14 They arent just now deciding to charge accordingly to it
Gotcha my fault
Import cost These things ship directly from ChinaIndia to EU or US
" value of the Euro



Theyre at basic parity at the moment"
Apple should give you the phone at is what is likely a loss because the Euro isnt doing well against the dollar through no fault of Apples
Most delusional person in this thread
Lol keep dreaming
"samsungs or xiaomis new releases

Are they priced in dollars"
Okay buddy
Lol youre a teenager definitely
You should get a cable organizer
"That black pill cutout containing the TrueDepth camera never changes in size Its fixed in the same spot on the display 

So the reason why in the marketing videos it looks like it can morph in length and shape is because Apple designed new software UI that surrounds this void in the display 

The software creates a black colored extension of the pill shape that visually makes you think its fluid and changing space on the display

Hope that makes sense"
Im not going to argue about which niche features are more important than others But if you hand a 13 Pro to someone whos been using an X since launch its going to feel like an upgrade Its the cumulative experience that matters
I added it to showcase the fucking prices Buying a cell phone that costs well over 2k  seems ridiculous
"Dude there are no cutouts needed on screen protectors for the notches lol and the iPhone 11 screen protectors are of course compatible with iPhone 1213 

Im literally holding an iPhone 11 with screen protector and used the spares on my gfs iPhone 12 Pro and brothers iPhone 13 yes it has a cutout where the iPhone 13 doesnt have speaker but it doesnt matter

I guess I have to be very specific with you the hardware is behind the screen because the cutout crystal is also part of the screen theres not a physical hole in there"
Dude Screen protectors dont have cutouts for the cameras The only cutout is for the speaker which is now at the very top edge of the phone The screen protectors wont have any cutouts for the pill
"The only hopeless one here is you 

I havent contradicted anything other than saying larger phones like a Plus or a Max are going to need to be two hand phones at times regardless of placement of things because of the size 

I use a Pro not Max and can use it perfectly now onehanded pulling down notifications and control center from basically the same place the Dynamic Island is 

You have poor comprehension skills and havent made any new argument other than perfect phones would be able to be used onehanded and I have already refuted that claim"
Peak internet right here
Yeah Idk if the interface is super Apple like I feel like Apple would use more bubbly tiles rather than the ones in Apollo That said he really prioritizes adopting all the technologies provided in iOS as soon as possible
Actually it is touch sensitive Theres nothing magic about letting a capacitive touch area pass over the camera lens Its using the same glass See 358 in this video httpsyoutubeQwEmj71KEzo
Agreed Its a good way to make a reality seem like it has a purpose but it doesnt do anything that couldnt be done if it wasnt there either
Notifications the things that pop up in the Notification Center are not what the Dynamic Island handles thats just fact the Dynamic Island isnt really for Notifications they arent Notifications
Then why are you going on and on about understanding holes Both that phone and this phone have a notch A different commenter that you did not directly respond to referred to it as a notch hole  Youre being nonsensical
"
I can obviously tell they used the word notch in a way that is not accurate 

Ok so still missing the point then

Good luck budhttpswwwmajortestscomsatreadingcomprehensiontest01

And no you dont need to be able to define notch to look at two phones and have an opinion on which is designed better"
You are on something Lmao
"What That doesnt even make sense

I never said users needed to touch it because it was a camera"
Barely over a year only on the inner display
I love the blend in on the z fold 3 it more or less dissappears
Huawei is niche considering their global reach has been cut Youd have to be a serious smartphone enthusiast to have even consider Huawei these days Quality of their devices do not count towards their status if nobody can be expected to reasonably use the device for anything
"Up to a certain point yes We currently do have it Try making a phone call and youll see the green phone button appear in the top left Thats a multitask bar restricted to a system application and one application only The magic pill will only extend this concept up to maybe one more application

Point being the pill it self does nothing that it could not have been achieved on any other device The design language and the interaction design is changing but its all software that they could have perfectly released on previous phones They wont because they are using it as a marketing tactic making previous hardware artificially obsolete to stimulate sales"
Exactly like I get disliking the fact that the hole punch is slightly more distracting Thats a valid point Also the new design is sortof optional lol The regular 14s have the notch
As if ios isnt absolutely loaded with originally android features Get real dude No android manufacturer is going ti intentionally ADD a notch to their phone
An under the screen camera that is good seems to be like the holy grail that everyone is chasing but no one can nail down Wonder if well ever achieve it I hope so Whats currently on the market is pretty bad in terms of quality
Your weird logic immediately falls apart once you realize this mythical full screen iPhone would be just as brandable as this new notch
"Lol yeah theyre totally doing it for branding Its definitely not them reimagining the space to make it more useful s

Dude go back posting how apple sheeple like to buy iPhones for status and stop making these dumb arguments"
"People want selfie cameras As long as you cant hide the camera under the screen which you cant if you dont want to shit all over camera quality there is either going to be a bezel or a notch Bezels add to the size of the phone and people dont like that this also looks more futuristic which people also like

The only argument for sacrificing functionality for branding is that its centred rather than offset like Samsungs but thats going to come down to personal preference as to which is a better option"
"its funny because i had an android capable of having a second app open as a smaller window that was like 4 years ago and you could still interact with both windows fully play a youtube vid while scrolling on a different app edit uber status etc 

but nooooo Apples the innovative one for introducing a small ass over glorified widget"
"I like how they used their bs reasoning on why the AOD can ONLY be materialized in their GLORIOUS and INNOVATIVE iPhone 14 Pro

Yeah right bro Ive had AOD since 2017 on my X and it works fine with minimal battery drain Apple is just upcharging for features older devices can do which isnt news"
"There arent any iPhone has the best system That doesnt mean they couldnt hide it under the screen like on the Z Fold 34

Dynamic Island is a clever way to deal with the punch hole but other manufacturers dont even have a punch hole these days Theres no getting away from the fact that theres still a large dead zone on the Pro screen"
I thought that it was discontinued long ago Even if not you cant compare phones like that Phones in a similar range with a similar set of features
Nice man congrats I went with deep purple 512gb The deep purple is slick to bad Ill put it in a case from day 1 I went with a UAG Kevlar MagSafe case that looks bad ass
By the way I was asking above question cause I thought perhaps you were one of select few that got the phone early to test it etc
Indubitable I think we can both agree that some people can go caseless and others cannot
Thats dope and all but what does that have to do with iPhone and their camera progression
Nobody uses the underscreen camera and the main camera on the 4 is pretty solid Not to mention that the fold gives you all the screen realetate to watch media instead of having an annoying notch in the way but you do you
Hahahah of course sheep of course
Tell your buddy to hit the icon on the upper right and when he turns the fold around he can see himself on the front screen while using main cameras for selfie He doesnt know how to use it sounds like
Why rid the user of the option Its been common in samsungs for the past 5 years
Fingerprint aint gonna happen Face ID is the way forward
What I mean is expanding black animations from the hole punch
Except the front camera pictures look terrible when theyre behind the screen The tech needs more time before it can perform as good as a cutout
At the cost of a terrible front facing camera Id wager that most people would prefer a better camera than having no notchhole punch
I know its real but that page reads like such a scam
If I might say so that is one nice looking phone
Smaller holes for current lineup With under screen camera quality being bad wont be surprising if they go with Apple route for next year models
Same unlikely as dropping headphone jack or having a notch
"Interesting I havent considered this

Can you tap the pill though Or only the parts of the dynamic island outside the pill"
Ok that sounds cool
Who else tried and had to scroll back to the comment thread 
Itll work if you tap anywhere along the top 
"Youre right When I try really hard to only touch the notch with the very tip of my finger it doesnt work So theyre correct you cant physically tap the notch to interact with the UI

But unless you have a really tiny finger or thumb touching the notch will almost always trigger that feature"
Therefore it should cost the same as in the US  tax which in europe is like 20 Still 150 EUR away from the current price What am I missing
I was talking about UI innovation There is no innovation in here even if there is a hole notch LMAO Didnt samsung have edge notifications They couldnt even think about using it But for sure you do you
"Have a dude in this thread arguing against USBC because he doesnt need it completely ignoring that USBC is better in every single way The same people who moan are the ones that sit and praise Apple when they implement something third parties have enabled for ages 45 years later

Apple fan boys seem to have a level of entitlement above any other tech fans where you cant slate Apple in anyway and anything else even things far superior are the devil That being said we have to remember what sub we are on and the type of people it attracts"
Dont waste your time with people like that theyve just drowned in apple hate koolaid
"This would be similar if someone said the automobile invented the wheel

Both a wagon and an automobile have a wheel while the automobile clearly has an improved one

Im not dismissing any effort but its very clear that the automobile was an iteration of what the wagon was in the same sense Dynamic Island is an iteration of holepunch notifications  Its not an entirely new invention that only apple has thought of"
"The independent dev team didnt put in more work they simply released a public version of the idea before any manufacturer did something similar  A lot of features happen this way especially ones that are adapted into Apple phones  Notably Night Shift and modern texting brought features available on Cydia years ago through flux and BiteSMS

And I definitely dont agree with your last statement  No other phone manufacturer was going to make an equivalent to Dynamic Island because they do not have a large enough cut out on the front screen to warrant such development  And all manufacturers have had some solid innovation unique to their phone that has helped all phones become better overall  I dont think Apple is leading phone innovation by any stretch but they do a great job at what they do  Personally I found the notch from iPhone X until now to be a huge eye sore and I am glad no other manufacturer went that route I will not personally use a phone with a notch like that"
"Thats the thing they wont all be doing the same thing Some vendors are not going to be able to mimic the pills feature set because they just dont have the talent inhouse to make those design changes and they certainly cant do it in a year

Apple has been working on this since the iPhone X Since 2018"
I dont see it as stealing so much as adopting a new standard Businesses dont exist solely to innovate
We do Its 2 years of factory defects warranty
"Its not that simple There is something thats required by law for 2 years but basicly after 1 year the customer has to proof that the fault was there from the start Which is essentially impossible

So the first year apple does the free repairs and from day 366 on your 100 sol and they wont do shit for you Some exceptions when they know a production line was faulty or a apple dude in a very good mood excluded 

95 of products here still have the full 2 year warranty And from the top of my head its only ALL apple products plus the gaming stuff from sonymicrosoft that only come with 1 year of proper warranty"
"Meh My mom used a s3 mini till like 14 months ago or so I still se tons of s78s aroundNo question they are quality phones But with more companies promising long updates and flagship androids offering similar build qualityor unique features see ultrafoldflip its hard to justify the pricetag

Also all this isnt even the point They are the only company that just slapped a big ass price increase in the face of customers And we all know they aint hurting for money There is nothing to defend"
Apple is increasing their prizes drastically other companies dont As consumers we have every right to complain and be upset about it Why are some Apple fans defending them so hard for this
I literally said taking into account usdeur parity
Funny how Apple is the only one raising prices Fold 4 is still the same price
Or we could call them out for the rampant profiteering thats an option too People myself included dragged Samsung over the coals when they kept the price of the foldflip 4 the same and this is no different
Where can we keep updated on your controller developments
Has Apple ever curved the bottom of the display I dont recall ever seeing that
I really hope this is a joke because what people in the US pay for healthcare is downright stupid
not all of europe has free healthcare unfortunately
Its not like they do a 11 conversion and be done with it There are multiple things at play here that drive costs up The devaluation of the Euro is just a part which makes everything else more expensive
Unironically yes
Yeah either that or a phone w usbc
" The software creates a black colored extension of the pill shape that visually makes you think its fluid and changing space on the display

so I was not confused then when I said they are deliberately showing black when theres no camera hole there"
"Here look at it simply

5 generations leading to the X

55S66S7X

5 Generations leading to the 14

XXS11121314

x200B

Are you genuinely saying weve seen as much of an improvement from the X14 compared with the 5X in the same time cycle

You are comparing a single generational change to 5 years of changes and even then at face value the user will likely go oh its faster has square edges and has a better camera

If Apple made USBC available which they clearly can do I wouldve been less critical of this update but still

A lot of people are indifferent about

 ESIM
 MagSafe
 120hz display"
"Nitpicking YouTube videos and benchmarks  In real world any mid range cpu is more than enough to do everything smoothly 

The a15 doesnt even support 8k video Most flagship android phones can shoot and play 8k video

And if the big thing in iPhones is the camera then not being able to shoot in 8k is just stupid Almost every high end TV nowadays is 8k Apples own top end display is 6k 

The earbud thing to map out your ears for better audio Sony did it first

Face recognition It was all the rage 8 years ago then it went away as people figured out that it was a gimmick and fingerprint was superior IPhones only got it in 2017

Fingerprints sensord have been put on phones for over 20 years now"
"Ive had them Most memorable were the s5 and nexus 6P I personally dont care for always on display lol Ill be turning it off if I get a iPhone 14 

But yeah man like I said you got me and I dont know anything 

Enjoy your phones man "
Then dont buy it Is someone forcing you
In fairness my screen protector does actually have a cutout for my 13pm Not saying its needed but its there
The interface hasnt changed much since he launched it in 2017 Back in 2017 apple hadnt done quite so much with the bubbly tiles and things  thats a relatively new thing
Could you give me some examples Honestly asking as I use it and wonder if Im missing out on the paid version
I know anything but the selfie camera
Ok bud whatever makes you feel better you can literally google it and see it
"A notch is not a hole

You do not understand what a notch or a hole is if you believe those terms are interchangeable

The iphone 14 pro has a hole

The iphone 14 has a notch

Notch an indentation or incision on an edge or surface

Hole a hollow place in a solid body or surface"
You said it encourages touching the camera no it doesnt plain and simple and even if it did It wouldnt affect anything
Bro your American education is showing
You did not consider how wide is reach of Huawei in Asia and some European countries
No the Dynamic island tracks up to three applications
Yeah I will say Im mostly just taking issue with their phrase deceitfully confuse which is just ridiculous lol For everything else they said yeah the concept isnt new its literally just the execution
Im not arguing who copied more lmao just pointing out that they can and will copy the pill just like they copied many questionable Apple choices before
Just like no Android manufacturer would ever remove the 35mm headphone port
I give it 3 months
"How would you know it was an iPhone on commercials and from the front when someone has a case on it Rounded corners and thinuniform bezels are easy to achieve The huge notch and now the huge pill shape go out of thier way to be reconnizeable Other smartphone makers have of course mimicked the notch but collectively dont because it is unnecessary and frankly stupid when solutions exist to minimize it or get rid of it entirely

Apple chooses to have these massive screen cut outs just so everyone will know you have an iPhone from the front Now Apple is choosing to make the notch slightly better by changing the shape shoehorning some functionality Functionality that would be better without the screen cutout at all that Apple has chosen to implement And all the fans lap it up as a huge success Lol it is bordering on Stockholm syndrome"
Or you just go with the good old pop out camera and stick a fingerprint sensor on the powerbutton
Nobody is saying its innovative its just very cleverly designed
Very nice Thats a badass looking case I went with a minimalistic pitaka carbon fiber case for my 11 but this time I really wanted to experience the naked phone so I got apple care in order to not use a case
Ahh sorry Im not that cool I also dont think reviewers get much of a choice in what theyre sent Super excited for it to come this friday
"Yeap Im a fold 3 user and that inner camera hardly gets used except for maybe a video call Selfie I use the other screen camera


Ive had an iPhone since the original up until the X IPhone is just uninteresting to me now as I dont care about better cameras The fold was something completely new If apple had released a foldable phone I would have stayed as I do think its a more seamless experience  The android experience is still pretty darn good and I do like how customizable it is Also the foldable screen is amazing 


With that said in 3 or 4 years time I may or may not switch back It all depends on what the manufacturers come up with"
Lol thats what they do though they wait until the tech can be better implemented for THEM And then they push it out even if it takes years For those who dont fuck with that theres Android Both OS are great I HATE THE PHONE COMPANY YOU LIKE SO YOURE SHEEPthat mentality does nothing for anyone and has to go Its old now
"Face ID has been common since 2017 Why add a finger print readerwhich they had when you have a superior FaceID 

Granted they could add a fingerprint reader in the screen But that doesnt mean theyll get rid of FaceID"
"God I miss TouchID FaceID is so dogshit in comparison At least 40 of the time it forces me to type my pin in even though my face is clear as fucking day 

I had my 7 up until last year so I was very spoilt by TouchID and even now a year in I still havent come around to FaceID It would be fine if it just worked"
Id rather not
Yup
The hole punch is way too small for that to look any good
Oh I wasnt saying it produces good results just showing this person that it exists
And most phones did avoid notches and went for much smaller teardrop cutouts or pinholes I dont even know if theres a modern Android phone that has something large enough to call a notch
The way they were talking about it made it sound like that entire area was tappable
If youre using Apollo then try tapping at the top a second time
It definitely does not for me
Stop talking time to take the crazy pill
Yeah i agree And its probably how the interaction with the pill will work
How does it cost the same in dollars and euros if the dollar is worth more than the euro
"Didnt samsung have edge notifications

Yes and you can also have an always on ring around the pinhole camera as a sort of notification LED which is nice and unobtrusive

I was talking about UI innovation

Android is doing more interesting stuff with UI than hiding notches they barely have anymore

For example having multiple apps on a split screen or having one app always on top I use this all the time for watching videos httpsyoutube4RCohUG8io

Or if you want to look at a design space that Apple hasnt even entered yet look at the Samsung Z flip 4 and its flex mode at 10m30s httpsyoutubeZtKvqXBq5d0"
"Man I used to use airpods pro paired to an Android phone and the number of times I basically had to go without earphones because I forgot to bring the one cable that has a different plug to literally every other device I have on me was a massive exercise in frustration

My phone iPad Laptop even my portable powerbank all charge via usb c so even if I didnt remember to bring an individual cable for each one as long as I brought one I could get through by strategically charging each device as required But not my airpods If I forgot to bring the single lightning cable I own my choice was a spend money for a new one or b go without earphones for the remainder of the trip"
I had someone on this sub a year or two back tell me that they dont want Apple to ever add an always on display to their phones because they already have an Apple Watch and they supposedly wouldnt benefit from an AOD on their phone instead of you know just turning the feature off and allowing others who dont want to spend hundreds of dollars on a wearable to benefit from that feature instead Some people are so opposed to having additional options and it is so strange to me
i was asking for a screenshot of the music feature you mentioned
Must be nice to do nothing and just wait for others to do the work for you
I recently managed to get a new 2021 iPad Pro like 20 days out of the 1 year warranty The screen had two stains on it one light and one dark They ran diagnostics which turned out 100 ok acknowledged that it had no visible damage and swapped it It indeed was a bit of a hassle with phone support but I managed to settle it in the Apple Store They basically took over with the support in Ireland and got the ok from there I found that you have to be bold and it helped that within three phone calls they didnt manage to settle the issue and also didnt call back twice other than what they promised
Well you still get a couple of years extra updates and use out of something like a 14pro compared to any android and the prices here in canada have stayed the same as before so we get more value Im not sure the 24 month 0 interest deal is available in your country though so it might not be worth it in all geographical regions
"To what degree did you take into account the parity

Given the currency value loss of 20 they wouldve needed to raise the price by 20 to make the same amount of money they used to They didnt They raised it by 13 If all overhead costs are equal they arent manufacturing and logistics cost more today than they used to then Apple is losing not making as much money this cycle compared to last year 

gReEdY BaStArDS"
Taken the currencies parity the phone prices is up 13 YOY and the  lost 20 purchasing power Objectively Apple is giving out a bargain here lol
"But you then proceeded to literally not take it into account

1299 is the price of the 999 iPhone 14 Pro

The Euro has fallen 20 so adding 20 is 11988 Then add 20 VAT on top thats 14385

Convert that to EUR its 143715"
It means Samsung is eating the loss currently
I dont quite understand how keeping your prices level during a period a high inflation is rampant profiteering but ok
One is more likely to be here soon
Of course not Come on dude Im not tying to be controversial I just tried to highlight the price difference between the continents 15k is a lot of money when people can buy phones that do all the same things with 10 of the price
"Yeah Ive seen them but I meant that they are not needed

I mean why would you want to have your notch unprotected"
Widgets are the first thing that come to mind
Yup same to you a quick google search would show you it serves as a multi tasking UI timer music etc
Wow thats real interesting You should tell the entire rest of the internet about it since everyone is calling a notch
It does The entire dynamic island is the camera and sensor cluster and thats where you tap to interact with notifications and mini control panels
Well explain to me the target market for a Huawei phone considering they cannot run Google services
How much of a market can it still support when it cannot support any Google services
My bad
"Another user said it best This is Apple simply adding slightly more functionality to a hardware component that would otherwise be of no further use except when specifically in use 

Its just Apple turning whats generally seen as a negative into something slightly less so now that the user has reason to interact with it via the UI"
Why the fuck would anyone copy the pill the entire industry has been doing nothing but trying to increase the amount of screen real estate which is exactly what apple is DOING by creating the pill Its one of the actual physical advantages that android phones have that apple is aiming for with this design  itd make 0 sense to replicate it And youre just way out of touch if you think otherwise
Im still fuckin pissed about that
"To be abundantly clear

Its currently not possible to hide the camera and sensors beneath the screen and for the front of a smartphone to be completely without some kind of notch I dont know why you think otherwise

Any brand would love to be the first one to bring a product like that to market The thought of apple choosing to not be that first company is laughable 

Sorry dude but youre way off on that one Later"
The underscreen cameras suck ass and wont work with the face ID sensor When they dont and will you bet Apple will immediately jump at the chance to sell a phone with them
Pop out camera Jesus Christ Are we 10 years old
The power button wouldnt work because most people use a case
The pop up cameras were cool for about 32 nanoseconds
Techradar called it innovative
Thank you Im paranoid af and drop my phone a few times in a year so I usually case it and buy apple care just in case
"What they do is implement small incremental upgradesfeatures  and charge you more money every year while other phones already have those features and do it better most of the time example multitasking notifications and widgets on Samsung


And yes both OS has advantages and Apple has an edge for third party development because their is only one OS across apple devices while Android is implemented in different versions across different manufacturers but my point is on my first paragraph here

I used to be a blind Apple fanboy and the funny thing is that I always had my iPhone rooted to get the functionalities and freedom I wanted then I realized that there are alternatives that offer this without the hassle and it is much better for my use case But of course most ppl can live with a vanilla phone I know its not for everyone its just funny how apple comes up with stuff that its already out there and ppl want to act like they reinvented the wheel One of the sadest episodes of this is when they came out with the pro version and only this version allowed you to flip your phone in landscape lmao wao and ppl are it up"
Im not saying get rid of it Im saying have them BOTH the same way most samsungs do TouchID has been very useful countless times in my life
My biggest reason for preferring touchID over faceID is being able to add 10 fingerprints I have my thumbs and the right thumb of the friends I regularly have in my passenger seat so they can control music from my phone without me having to unlock it every time they let the screen go to sleep With Face ID I either have to look away from the road to make eye contact with the phone theyre shoving in my face or they have to fight with it to stop trying to faceID and let them type in my password
You need to rescan your face or something The only times Ive ever had to put my pin in is if Im in bed and most of my face is covered by pillow or blanket or something like that
You need to rescan your face Face ID is flawless for me unless its pitch dark in the room
Buy an SE then
Fair enough However I think youre going to be disappointed Touch ID isnt going to come back any time soon outside of the SE
I mean sure after they had copied the notch they did try to remove it But in terms of software like the gestures that Apple added with the iPhone X or the control center were all copied so I wouldnt be surprised if suddenly Android devs decided to do something with their pills and cutouts
Only the  Galaxy tab ultra has a notch
"That would be amazing actually apart from the smudges on the camera

If its not touchsensitive though then I maintain they couldve done the same thing with a notch "
"Same as the notch The touch sensitivity overflows into the faceID bits slightly Your screen action bridges the gap

Im sure the notch is sorta the same The touch sensitivity is small enough that the fleshy bits of your finger will inevitably meet the touch sensitive parts"
Island
What are you smoking exactly USD and EUR are 11 with EUR being worth slightly more than the USD
Girl split screen and shit like thats a whole different topic Im not saying its not interesting and i think the first one who did split screens have the stroke of genius as well one of those simple things like i said But dont act like this aint genius Sure u can hide the notch all u want thats what everyone did But apple knows the limits of their tech and actually played around with it Thats genius Its turning their weakness into a strength
Damn the split screen thing is cool
"Yes it was a bit reductionist of me to simplify dynamic island to simply notification system centered on cutouts on LED screen as they definitely did go the extra mile such that it feels more like a notificaiton system on your screen instead of a cutout portion of your display

It was definitely a unique implementation compared to the existing concepts out there and perhaps legally that was enough to earn them a patent on the feature which would count as them inventing it  I gave it a good ten minutes to find the patent but that is a real rabbit hole to dive into

Personally I find dynamic island a bit more close to the android adaption I linked than the one you show on the J2 strictly because it is a system created using the selfie camera and the main LED display screen together to produce useful information where there was none before  Its more of a software solution designed to remedy a hardware eye sore while the J2 implementation is all additional hardware with the sole purpose of being a notification system that exists on the back of your phone separate from the main display"
"The whole reason its popular is because it is centered around the cutout

This implementation makes it look like theres a second cutout"
If you really think they do nothing then why dont you go do it and get rich its easy right
Yeah its great actually because then I get all the bestcoolest feature innovations and I dont have to pay the Apple pricetag
 to Dollar rate ist 11 right now not 112
And Apple cant
There are plenty of phone with USBc now Apple is way behind here
Yes but youre looking at phones that are already expensive Its not like an iPhone is 50 here If someone is willing to commit to an iPhone Pro the minimum spend is already over a grand
Honestly its what came up when I was buying screen protectors on Amazon and I didnt think twice about it
My standard Reddit widgets work just fine
No one is calling a hole a notch except for imbeciles which the internet has plenty of
No it isnt you touch the buttons themselves but again even if you touch the sensors and camera its a non issue
My Huawei phone gets Google services fine at ur moms house Maybe you should check there she said you used to call all the time
16 billion  in China a number of people in SEA Europe as long as they can work on their own services
Well said
Apple users a mindless sheep who think apple just did something new mean while I looks a bout 34 generations old for Android users
To clarify there are cameras that are hidden beneath the screen at the cost of a cut out with very low pixel density over the top The pictures from these cameras look pretty terrible though
"It is 100 possible to hide the camera under the screen Other phones have done it Apple could do it and do it better 

The IR blastersenor has not been done under a screen to my knowledge but that does not mean it cannot be done 

Even if touch ID cannot be placed under the screen there are other solutions They could go back to finger print sensors either under the screen on the side of the phone or even on the back They could mount the touch ID hardware differently like in the corners or some other way that I am sure the world class engineers that apple employees would be able to accomplish 

Apple has almost literally infinite money to figure this out And everyone gives them a pass"
"Its not even hard to achieve a screen without a notch and uniform thin bezels It has even been done multiple times

Popout camera fingerprint sensor on the power button Done"
"I know why they think otherwise Because eg the Galaxy S line has been putting the fingerprint and proximity sensors behind the display panel for at least the past 3 generations The hole punch selfie cam does technically obscure part of the screen but in typical usage its very well camouflaged 
The only logical reason to keep the objectively inferior notch is to ensure that the device can be identified as an iPhone regardless of whats currently being displayed on the screen"
"Do you want the notch gone or not

Cause if you do thats the currently available solution"
"The the case just has a cutout around the power button

Because guess what Works on various Android phones so it works on apple"
Well that case certainly looks like it will protect it nicely cool choice indeed
If you want more personalization and broader functionality then android is definitely better for you I just like for my stuff to work as simply as possible and I dont really care how much I get to personalize so apple is better for me Everyone has preferences I used to be a Oneplus fanboy till switching to iphone 11
Thats great Ive had BOTH throughout my years Even the G1 I was literally there since the beginning lol BOTH OS are great Both have their pros and cons The only Android phone I would get is probably a Galaxy and thats comparable to iPhone in price Whoever wants a cheaper alternative will get that I dont want that I Prefer iPhone thanks This isnt just some blind purchase and believe it or not some people DONT buy an iPhone every year
"How often do I need to do that I never had to redo my fingerprint Practically TouchID was superior for me personally and the downvotes arent going to change that 

It even fails to unlock when Im wearing my Apple Watch and then when I type the passcode in it will suddenly say unlocked by Apple Watch when it obviously wasnt 

Its ridiculously inconsistent"
Pitch dark works well too for me because the sensors have an IR blaster that throws IR to map your face Besides just the screens backlight should be enough anyway
I mean I would but I upgrade my phone once every 45 years so my current phone still has 3 years left in it
And I wonder how long theyll keep the SE around before they minify it too
Fair but it would be really weird for them to make this feature so prominent and out so much effort into it and then not make it touch sensitive
"You were exactly right

MKBHD talks about this in his handson video

httpsyoutubepTCgWVjB6UE"
Hurry up youre getting worse by the second
ok crackhead so if the euro is worth slightly more than the dollar how would the costs be the same
Still early to say the market would decide on this If it gets popular more would adopt
"Harder to be hired than do the actual job

Lol its applicable to most job hence networking is important Opportunities not equal to everyone too"
"Thats not the point the EUR is in the toilet due to lack of inflation measures by the ECB Whereas the USD stays strong due to the actions by FED Try to compare interest rate actions

This affects importexport dynamics

1 EUR is not worth to Apple or any American entity what it was 1 year ago If a European paid 100 to Apple in 2021 it would be 118 Today that is only worth 100

To compensate Apple has to rise the Euro price accordingly to make the same revenue on their American export"
Or are those phones behind by not having lightning  Pretty sure I know more people with iPhones than with other types
But were they available at launch

Bravo good one Hope you feel better about yourself In other news unless youre Chinese nobody uses a fucking Huawei
"I understand Huawei still being massive in their home market otherwise I wonder how they couldve survived as long But what benefit do Europeans gain from using a Huawei versus another brand that can use Google services

And moreso what do you mean by work on their own services Do you mean that you can host your email services for example and use your phone that way Buy an unlocked phone and pop a SIM in"
Samsung copied apple with the S10 s
Yea this is a common argument I hear They have the money they have the talent the tech MUST be there  But so far we havent see the tech get there just yet I dont think its a branding decision
Or just go with a pop out selfie camera and stick a fingerprint sensor on the powerbutton
Then go do it for them and get paid the big bucks
Popout camera 
"Yeah thats not a solution at all Notch will stay until they can do the right solution 

Honestly Id still prefer a top bezel that never bothered me in the first place Make the top few pixels of the screen reserved for OS stuff or you could even make it into a second screen that only shows date and battery level on either side of the notch either way stop having developers interact with the notch at all iOS screens are rectangular again problem solved"
Agreed
"Its in Settings  FaceID 

You might want to try rescanning outside under optimal lighting conditions What youre describing is not the experience Ive had"
"	Do what though What could you do with a tiny holepunch

Even if you cant do much with the holepunch they can still use that type of notification For example the ones centered around timers music connected devices and so on"
Current lineup sure but next year models might be different
Also true Ill be waiting for handson reviews even more now 
You mean dynamic
"httpsletmegooglethatcomq1eurtousdhttpsletmegooglethatcomq1eurtousd  
Are you alright Do you want me to draw you a picture"
"Its sad to see people turning away from math and logic to just parrot the cOrPoRaTe gReed shit Reddit isnt really known for nuance though just populist mentality 

Are corporations greedy Sure But taking it out on Apple when they increase the price 13 YoY to balance out a 20 currency value loss is hilarious Thats literally a savings compared to last years model when accounting for the inflation 

Math can be hard But this math isnt Just poor comprehension by that other dude"
"What you and others are implying is that Apple needs more margin in Europe than they do in the US I totally reject that premise Apple is a global company that makes its phones in China So extra logistical costs for Europe dont really exist Or said otherwise they also apply to the US and are already factored into the US pricing  There is no American export iPhones get imported straight from China to Europe through their European entity in Ireland The dont ship them to the US first so their is no US  Europe export going on justifying the extra needed margin 
An iPhone 14 pro is 1329 euros in my country Assume usd eur parity and you just need to add 21 VAT to the US 999 price  Thats 1209 euro Which gives an extra European margin of 120"
Now youre thinking different
Alright Im out bye  Congratulations on your decision to berate people for using the definition of words correctly
Its a non issue Jesus
"A variety of phones from 100 bucks to luxury phones 

Huawei had their own proprietary analog to Google Mobile Services which is called Huawei Mobile Services"
I completely agree However the people that mindlessly defend apple and tell everyone to get an iphone because they cant message outside of imessage are mindless sheep though
Calling apple users brainless sheep is a completely fair statement they think every apple do is great and whenever apple realise a basic feature like widgets that android has had for damn near twenty years and act like they invented
They dont want to add more moving parts More likely to break
good lord you are dumb
"They dont take extra margin in Europe If anything they take lower margin The old iPhone was also 999 and the EU price was 1155 due to the VAT but deducting VAT sets it at a lower base price than the US model 

Now the EUR has been weakened significantly You are forgetting that Apple is an American company that accounts in USD no matter if its operations are international or not Same goes for any other American based company selling in Europe

On top of that it also provides extra services in EU such as 2 years of warranty instead of 1 in the US and a sim tray to live up to EU standards making it a separate product compared to its domestic market"
Hah thats ironic
Ah gotcha Do you have any experience with Huawei Mobile Services How well does it fare compared to a similarly equipped Android phone
In front of pure evidence showing how wrong you are thats what you could come up with I feel sad for you
Please dont feel bad for me Im more closely in touch with this than you realize Have a pleasant weekend
I kinda have a crush on Marques 
Very nice

One year later and the title is correct The 15 pros are a carbon copy of the 14 pros Just with a newer processor with some titanium slapped on to the frame
            
Now Ive got the 14 pro coming from the 11 pro max and its a pleasant upgrade better internals better display first iPhone with new notch amazing camera system battery on the 14 pro has been good for normal use luckily for me I dont do gaming on phones so I have all day battery I was gonna wait for the 15 pro but its much cheaper the 14 pro and a really nice feel worth the money in my opinion
can you buy me iphone14pro pls
Time now to finally upgrade to iPhone 14 Pro now that iPhone 15 has been launched 
One year later 
Hamara free fire channel mein jo tumhara ke liye Bane rahana chahie
Is it worthwhile spending that extra  for the pro over the basic 14
And it definitely was copied  wasnt surprised about that innovation 
Will be copied and done better
Apple accepts Apple  
Connecting to AirPods x2 babyyyy
My Apple Watch thought I had fallen while I was just taking the trash out and it was just seconds away from calling emergency services Im glad I saw it just in time to cancel it I turned the feature off and I would turn off car crash detection immediately too just like autocorrect which is the number 1 feature I disable when getting a new phone
Dude please please acknowledge the green screen error issues for iphone13 and now 14
The music playing was Born Sinner 
Nice i phone 
Peeps iPhone 14 vs iPhone 14 pro which one should I go for For context I dont take a lot of photos but the I am very excited about the dynamic island and a few other features Is it worth spending a little more to get the pro version
I would know 
Top 
I go camping and 4WDing in Rural Australia I love the remote GPS emergency feature as I always want that security
yo what wallpaper is that i swear i just rewatched this so many times and still dont know what it is

"I need but im havent mony



I have iphone 5s"
"Hey mate 
Can you explain me now a days iphone 13 And probably 14 series green screen issue"
i was waiting for the iphone 15 but it looks like apple has again decided to put 60hz on their regular models like comeon my 2020 android has 90hz screen Thats a deal breaker for me in India iPhone prices are off the charts and newly launched pro iPhones are unthinkable for me and if I am paying this much money I dont want a 60hz choppy screen I am thinking about buying the iPhone 14 pro at the end of 2023 is this a bad idea
New to the channel and I have to say that your branding and marketing skills are really top notch impressive The shirts hoodies hats wristbands The look the designs themselves the overall flow of it is just damn good
very good review
Nice

Dynamic island is a notification bar renamed
I cant wait till they do usb c in an apple way bruh 
Car crash mode hopefully wont activate in a rollercoaster
that over expose shit is annoying im tryna look good for the baddies man
I am island boy 
Ive been using iphones for about 5 years now until then i used lg until i got the samsung 7 edge i broke it got a iphone 7 then a iPhone 11 upgraded finally to the 14 pro I absolutely love this phone
While not innovative like they were its nice to have them focus on just making what theyre good at Thats pretty hard since the world tends to fight back at things being standardized
that intro was slick
Bro I love that wallpaper
 bhai mere ko iPhone gift kar do Android mein video banane mein dikkat hoti hai please that I phone dila do 
Apple has such boring changes every year like going from my 11 pro max to the 13 pro was actually a decent upgrade i loved them going back to the older style of design with the 12 and onward but now i want to upgrade the 13 pro and i know a 14 pro is a waste of money but i have a feeling the 15 pro will be the same at best it will have an action button thinner bezels and a usbc port wich apple will find a way to nerf for anything not apple approved so whats the point really struggling to decide if i wait for the 15 pro get an s23 wait for the s24 in hopes they put the qhd display on smaller models OR keep the 13 pro wich is still a good phone I just wish apple offered more they tend to cater more towards sharing abilities with friends and their eco system i just no longer find it appealing wich is a shame as i do enjoy using the 13 pro its been a solid phone the past two years
Dont have money to buy a new phone and still using Iphone 7 Hi to those people who are still using 7 
Im glad we get sim trays esim only would suck badly
Title title title Its been 11 months and no one has copied it at least the major brands
We in Europe have a Sim Port at the 14 Pro and Pro Max
Still have a 10 and am thinking about upgrading
Definitely wanst copied 
Its easy to make the best camera system in a phone when said camera system doesnt actually fit in the phone and sticks obnoxiously out of the back

Watching this almost a year later and NO ONE has copied this Lol Dynamic Island is more annoying than functional 
Hate the always on display Apple way is just form over function
Does the pill cover video games Just looking at it drives me nuts Like a stuck pixel x1000

Still no one copied

Nice phone but you would think after paying a lot of money for this phone they could at least add the plug that goes with it People buy the phone and they go home to charge it only to find out the phone doesnt come with a plug really
Apple always best no doubt 
My friend Barthalamule told me that the dynamic island was placed in each phone using majic My friend Barthamule is really smart he has a doctorates degree from Strawberry Cheesecake Online university
1812 the watch tan lmao
I hate mine Siri doesnt always work face id quite often doesnt work doesnt always wake up when you tap it the phone is super slow at times like loading Google Maps and its clumsy They tried so hard to make it more intuitive but in reality they just made it worse
I hate what Apple is doing with taking away the sim card slot for us in the US but gotta give them credit with the dynamic island cus they took something that was an eye sore and make it into something useful Very cool Now lets bring back the sim card slot I shouldnt have to order one from a whole ass different country just to get what should already be there
Bro is such a fanboy
realme C55 Copied this phone they called the dynamic island Mini Capsule
Hi everyone this is my new friend on my iPhone 14 pro max his name is Phil Hes a pill shaped camera that helps me with intuitive tasks and multitasking
Re the D I  I was thinking My LG V20 did that Was my favorite phone in part for this very reason The phone was buggy as hell though and took awful selfies way over processed without the option to change the settings  I wish I could trust LG phones I would def go back to the brand  but it was just too unpredictable with those reset loops that kept me from even being able to use it at times Scary when I was out and about at night in particular
Jesus Christ apple does not upgrade
Great information thanks
Was your dad ah teacher at DHE
good job brother
Help me place 
A friend of mine just upgraded from the 12pro Cuz of storage and battery but Im sticking with my 12 for at least two more years
I want the damn pill GONE not made into a feature The feature would be it being invisible
I have always wondered what iPhone would look like with the dynamic island
"using 14 pro max for a week pretty impressed with perfomance and all but the cons are night photography is not so good and they made photos somehow bad than 13 pro max and Im wishing it will have a improvement in camera and phone heating issue still not solved in 16
6 updateIf you are planning to buy pro just make sure you like dynamic island because it looks quite big in pro thats the only thing that I didnt buy pro model"
This is my upgrade and Im sooo excited
Nobody has copied and nobody will wack feature
"This will be copied
This did not age well "
Did you remember to floss Marques
Can I still get esim in Australia
Product for gays

Apple is still lagging behind Android because of limited Application availability
Came back to this review and i completely forgot i had an AOD I turned mine off as soon as i got the phone
As an Android user for years I think it has been 4 years since I had a new phone I recently bought the Iphone 14 Pro Max and I can tell you the premium feeling of apple is surreal It was worth it
Not here for Apple but for Marques incredible production quality Not here for Apple but for Marques incredible production quality
I love dynamic island I just love it 
This dudes camera is so damn good lmao
"When will apple actually bother to implement close all apps at once
Its not like that it is too complicated to do
Android has this since day 1 basically"
That iphone 14 pro is so amazing and great video man 
Kon kon India se hai
Here I sit with an XR might upgrade for this
"Hey guys
Need a suggestion from yall Im currently using a 180 phone ie Realme 5 Pro and planned to switch to iPhone 14 Pro Will be good for me"
Getting rid of the sim tray lol FFS what they doing
Yes sure the idea was copied by Samsung in 2019 the Samsung Galaxy S 10 5 G had the dynamic island but not in the middle for the TOF 3D camera without actually being used for a few functions anyway relatively few as in 14 Pros incredible technology
Is it worth it paying extra for the pro
I got it today

What widget is he using btw
The removal of the sim tray was an interesting step I feel like Apples tryna do this transition where they will establish their own network service like ATT and TMobile Announcing the satellite emergency SOS with the Apple watch ultra which will be a subscription based model after a certain time period is similar to Starlink
"Me in September 2022 Im never going to get an iphone 14 pro its too expensive Ill just buy the iphone 13

Also me in June 2023 BuYs a 256gb IpHonE 14 PrO"
There is no physical SIM slot so you have to use digital SIM
My first ever iPhone 
Blisters type
Apple lack of wallpaperu need to download on the android then sent it to an iPhone
Wow that feeling when your Iphone 14 pro breaks for the thrid time and you cant access your gmail account to get the Google Fiber that is broken fixed beause this doghsisehflhglreaea
I think I will wait for the iPhone 16 or the iPhone ultra
I ride my mountain bike with with my Apple Watch on and the crash detection didnt go off
This guy has good music taste
No company has copied this yet
Just upgrade cause they give me 1000 for me 12 pro

This will be copied
The hoodie looks awesome bro

Hi Marques would you suggest IPhone 14 pro or the Doogee VMax Seems a stupid question but Im really considering the Doogee versus the Iphone 14pro have you reviewed one of these Best
"Title seems to have aged poorly 

haha"
Crash detection texted everyone in my emergency contacts that I was in an accident I was driving go carts and crashed and spun out and I had everyone calling me after that worried
kinda late but something i observed when using my 14 pro max while snowboarding this winter is that it is fairly easy to trigger crash detection when skiingsnowboarding i imagine this is because you can go from like 30mph to 0mph quickly and sometimes take some hard slams in the process but it still went off like 9 or so times throughout the season so be careful lol
Im not an apple user most of the time but the dynamic island thing is genuinely so cool to me One of the rare times apple has actually added a feature instead of removing them in recent years
"This is the comment 9 month later
So many phones launched since dynamic island and still NO ONE copied it And probably the reason is not because it is difficult"
yeah so I bought the iPhone 14 pro coming from a oneplus Nord its a really huge upgrade to me I mean that a16 bionic is on another level and the 120hz promotion display is remarkable
My friend crashed while skiing once and the automatic crash detection sent out a message to a dispatch station that then asked him if he needed assistance good idea just annoying for people who like to go fast and crash sometimes without getting hurt
I keep coming to you for reviews on many items Your style and videography is by far the best Ive seen Two thumbs up my friend Thanks for all you do
Lost me at no SIM tray pass
No one actually copied it 
me who still has an iphone 7
I think its time to upgrade from my XR to iPhone 13
Can the always on display turn off
Watching this rn on my new iphone 14 pro I love it
Ive had my deep purple 14 pro for about 6 months now I upgraded from an 11 that I dropped in the river Im very impressed with it and love the dynamic island Im finding myself surfing through apps on the go and its very convenient I almost always have AirPods In and love the connection as well
No phones except chinese phones will copy this lets be honest
I have never been ablae to afford an Iphone inmy life can you gift me one of your old iphones I will be a great subscriber 
Z u d tf
    
Can someone tell me how he got the full calendar with events bolded on his lock screen  If anyone knows lol  138
8 months later and no one cares
More ram was a big w for me when upgrading from 12 to 14 pro
I recently bought an iphone 14 pro and everything is great except one major problem ive been using it for 5 days now and it just randomly shuts off while still having more than enough battery life sometimes even at full battery I mean it reboots very quickly but its very annoying when it happens when im in the middle of a call or something important I just wanted to see if anyone else has been having this issue and is there a fix for it For context the phone has 100 battery health and i use an original apple charger
For me its totally a shit phone
Yeah its just the fact that if any android mobile manufacturer did this move before apple theyd get hated onbut when apple did it its cool
Turns out Dynamic Island isnt that much popular after 8 months
Who is going to copy this ugly design
1857
Fucking I phn 14 pro max dont buy
idk about the rest of you guys but i watched the video and i swear he subtly hints that theres no big improvements and that its not worth he even roast the dynamic island lol
My 11pro battery is toast so Ive been considering upgrading
The only guy I trust for reviews I dont think hes dishonest or trying to manipulate or lie to me
Please Wallpaper
once you go samsung you never go back like conservatives
Is it just me who noticed that MKBHD said connecting AirPods twice in the list of Dynamic Island features
whats knee PT 
"Hi
I have been thinking of buying a new phone Right now I have iphone 11 and I wanted to get a new phone that will also good for filming videos on youtube
I am planing on starting soon and so wanted to get some opinions
Thanks"
love your reviews
iPhone are really trash everything in this mobile are obnoxious how narrow minded and ignorant a person would have to be to be able to use that phone and be satisfied
I think iPhone maded for fainthearted people the worst mobile ever I use
Nice video
The dynamic island shows up in screen recording
w vid
My brother just updated to an iPhone 14 Pro Max from an iPhone 6 Plus Im excited for the upgrade he is now experiencing
racism on the overexposure

You should make a video about iphone calls iPhone needs to have and option for confirming calls before dial 
Whats the back ground song 
Lg phones were way ahead of their time but people chose generic instead on new its sad they discontinued them i love the LG G phones
What is your theme that youre using on the iphone
I was in a trolley  car crash and it didnt recognize the crash
Is that a Tesla surfboard in the background
upgraded from the xs to the 14 pro dynamic island is about the only cool new thing about it i dont game so not super exciting camera will be much better but until i need it im kinda underwhelmed
Got mine just today its the best phone Ive ever owned
I upgraded to this from the iPhone XS wasnt quite sure if I should wait almost another year for the 15 Very glad I didnt very glad I made my XS work thru the iPhone 13 and after spending a couple months with this I mean its a fantastic device and Ive loved getting out and using the camera
This Will be CopiedNot
I got the crash detection to active when I was punching a heavy bag with the phone on my body
1115 did he say connecting AirPods twice
I just got the iPhone pro Amazing phone But the always on display Not for me Makes me feel like I didnt lock my phone I turned that feature off
for years ive been a user of iphones and galaxy phones switching between the two every other year i just switched to the iphone 14 pro from my galaxy s21 and i gotta say im not that impressed with the iphone sure the screen gets insanely bright and i love imessage but thats about it going to trade this in and get a galaxy s23 that has longer battery life and just as good of a camera
The title of the video says this will be copied Now show me who the fk copied that Predicting that is too much of a talent for the best tech reviewer in the world YUSSM Being honest and speaking what matters is your job Do the thing with apple as you did for OnePlus review We got an improved OnePlus thanks Why dont talk about widgets doing wtever the fk dynamic shit does 
I switched for the first time since iPhone 4s The dynamic island is a waste I listen to music voice message poppes up I take the message and then whatever was in the dynamic island like a podcast I was listening is gone So whats the point if I cant go back to what I listened before
Not here for the phone but for the awesome production quality that gets increasingly better every upload
I switched to ATT just for the LG v10 It was worth the switch at the time as this phone was innovative for its time
its sucks when u using iphone11 and up to date and at the end it turn out it becomes nighmare when u need to change u iphone to the latest one after update the ip11 and everything is mess up with the system and it is really sucks 
As you said in the LG video youtubers are the reason of LG leaving smartphone market For example you make best video editing for iphoneapple videos but not for other videos This is not nice and cause people to think iphone is the best phone
Still no finger print sensor
5years notch and 5years dynamic island
Hey Love the content great work Could you please do a video explaining the different Chipsets ie what is multi core vs single core whats the difference between Snap dragon vs Apple Silicone etc etc
7 months later nobody copied that horrific design and people even tech youtubers got blinded with the little animation it does Get rid of that pill shape bar at the top 
the size of the iPhone pro models is great for 10 to 15 year olds
Great review as always I was thinking of trying one out
So I hadnt seen this mentioned and came across by accident but when u have music playing in the dynamic island if u swipe left inside of it it turns it off then swipe it again comes back on Pretty cool
Great job thank you
iPhone memang tidak ada duanya
As someone who once had an iPod classic iPod Nano iPod Touch and the old iPhone 4S lineups back in the day as a kid in grade school I gotta say the iPhone series has gone so far since then from Apple As much as I also love Android and Google phones I still have feelings of nostalgia when looking at Apple products Lol
Signal will be worse then any other phone you have ever used in ur life
Purple  Colour is m
730 I agree mkbhd
do not go on rollercoasters with this phone
wallpaper looks good
Decided to switch from my galaxy s20 fe 5g Love my phone but wanted to try out iPhone for a lil while Just ordered the 14 pro
lol no more 12mp streak 
Bro honestly deserves a job for Apple for the quality and professionalism of these videos
Anyone watching in 2029
1856 villager noise intensifies
I feel like the 14 pro max will definitely improve overtime cause all the issues seem to stem from the software itself rather than hardware
I have the Realme C55 thats released last March and I can confirm your prediction about the copying of the Dynamic Island The Mini Capsule is the first android integration of the dynamic notch AND ITS FROM A BUDGET PHONE LOL Its still on beta phase though with only 2 functions yet But realme says that it will add some features over time
Love your content but in this video on your left back Black window distracting viewers plz make sure next time

dynamic island is sweet but it is the same haha
Still waiting for the copied to flow in
Brother your production is next level really appreciated 
How can you seriously consider using an iPhone for pro video  moviemaking when none of them can function in hot sun The screen keeps dimming more and more from the heat until its no longer visible and then it shuts down entirely 
Lol what accident car crash alert 
Young man you are by far one of the very best bloggers on the net Your depth of knowledge is explicit and the ability to translate tech stuff to daily vernacular  which many of us are in desperate need  is refreshing Your strong on camera presence and verbal style are the cherry on the cake Keep on keeping on Im a 70 year old fan of your so youre connecting with a wide audience 
Is the iPhone 14 pro max 1TB going to be in slow browsing if I add too many apps and pictures and videos in it or no

This is my first time watching a Marcusbrownlee phone review
Why would anyone copy this when we already have alternatives like under display cameras that are getting better and better Also the motorized ones like OnePlus 7 Pro
"this is my first ever iphone at 15 years old i switched from a broken galaxy a21s 

needless to say the screen audio camera software IS AMAZING"
Having used it now its remind me of the iPhone 7 Its a couple of quality of life improvements Nothing earth shattering but a good update for people that are due for a carrrier upgrade
Man I have to buy an iPhone for work  Im a huge android person
The 14 pro was my first pro version for iPhone I recently switched to the pro max for the bigger screen but Im glad I went for the pro this time
Am I the only person who noticed that is listening to Kanye West the absolute legend
wait for 15 or buy 14
Im switching from an iPhone 6s plus to the iPhone 14 pro max
i need this iphone i just got into a crash yesterday and my 12 is literally shattered
Cool

MY New Chanal RY Dream  canton Stories
Please give it to me
There are apps on the playstore featuting dynamic island
I feel like Samsung keeps iphone a year behind the on displays which is understandable
Iphone is reliable but very basic in what you can do with it since they blocked the jailbreaking I switched to android since I can do whatever and dont have all the restrictions and has way better features The downside of android is malware is easier to get and it never fails that the battery goes to shit after 3mo of buying a new phone and they have amazing fast chips but if you try and play any graphic heavy games your phone gets hot to the touch and itll shut down or youll shorten the life of the phone so basically unable to play any games Ill be switching to iphone again to give it a try
love your videos bro
"Am I the only one who prefers the form factor of the 14 Plus  Its thinner and feels quite a bit lighter Might be an illusion but if you want a bigger phone Ive found the Plus to be the sweet spot

The Pro Max felt quite a bit clunkier and heavier Although I do recognise it has significant improvements in tech over the Plus"
My complaint with the camera is that you almost need to be a professional photographer to get the best photo A lot of settings to fidget with It seem as though you cant just point and click anymore and be satisfied With my old 7 plus I could pull it out Take a picture look at it and say That looks good Not with my 14 pro max I have to start fidgeting
Apple is the kind of company that change practically nothing but make it look like they changed a lot in the adverts
Lol I have a v10 still
I compared this side by side in the Apple Store very little difference compared to my old phone  a teeny tiny speed increase Maybe  i have an IPhone X i still have a sim tray and 3D touch  yey meeee
i got the Xr back in early 2021 which has been 2 years now and the lag starts ever since i updated to ios 16 despite the Xr was released on 2018 making it almost 5 years old phone now im deciding whether or not getting the 14 pro or the 14 is it worth upgrading  since 14 has an oled display which i really liked it
The thicker the better
Whats the use of such a fast processor and fluid os if it cant do multitasking in even 2023its not a smartphone its a dabba phone which can take great images with calling feature addon 
Apple should just made the pro line up to support apple pencil
worst apple they sadi AOD is exclusive to 14 pro modelsAOD is a software feature they can push that to all AMOLED apple models instead dining that they said AOD is hardware option and people are  accepting that 
I was pretty disappointed to discovered that the SOS satellite feature will not work in any southern hemispheric nation lm based in Australia and travel around it also travel to the southern island nation of New Zealand for wilderness adventures latitudes above 62 degrees wont either so northern Canada and Alaskareal shame
Does anyone know what rectangular widget he is using on the Lock Screen to the left of both of the circle ones
Watching on my iPhone 14 pro
Australian versions have simcard  esim waaaayyyy better then just one or the other

Whats the wallpaper he uses
6 months later i dont use this shit
Why dont you record in 60 FPS 
"And to think I was excited about the Pixel 7s front facing camera cutout pulsing 

Ive always loved the recent iPhones hardware and appearance just a clean basic lookbut lets be honestpure Google Android not AOSP not any other manufacturers use of Android but Googles own use of Android themselves is the superior phone OSat least to those of us who enjoy choice customization and controlling our own devices Yes yes Google I know but those who know know with pure Android you can get rid of GApps and Google so while the company may still have gone slightly crazy the core OS is still open source so all has the potential to still be remedied from within lol"
that fucking intro animation was so clean jesus
Whos the good boy in the video
really sorry I have been away from home
Im in London in the UK when I set my iPhone 14 Pro up it mentioned eSIM of course I inserted the SIM in from the old iPhone 13 Pro then life goes on
Love your channel
Your wallpaper plz
Satellite connectivity hmmm who could possibly tap into that without your knowledge  I would never need it but I could see mountain hikers who might welcome it  I like the new look rounded corners and the improved camera  My son took some photos with his Samsung developed them on his phone and immediately I was shocked at what the camera on his phone was able to do  The resolution was that of my camera  I hope the camera of the iPhone 14 Pro is just as impressive
The sound quality of  Marques videos are incredible paired with the AirPods Pro 2s its a privilege and experience to watch these videos

THIS IS HOW YOU KNOW HES A APPLE FANBOY COULD YOU IMAGINE WHAT HE WOULD SAY IF SAMSUNG HAD THE DYNAMIC ISLAND HE WOULD ROAST THEM HAHAHAHAHA
Gone mine yesterday and I absolutely love it my favorite iPhone to date 14 Pro Max 512 GB Purple with Sim
Just saying nobody copied it 
Is the Iphone 14 pro built stronger than the i7 I like a phone that doesnt need a casing My iphone7 has no scratch yet though I have dropped it several times through the years with no casing The battery is now real bad though Was hoping to buy the new Iphone if its built as strong
I upgraded to 14 pro max from iphone 11 so far in love with it especially the 120hz 
The intro is absolutely sick 
Reading all these comments tells us that Dynamic Island is completely misunderstood by those who have never used it I would never want to return to the slot on top  WTG Apple 
They got in an accident on Rich Rebuilds car channel and it went off
Apple going simless is crap same as going headjackless
I just wanna know what that noodle bowl was It looked insanely good
nice
And viola after 6 months nobody copied it
"why do i watch these videos knowing 100 im trapped in poverty and never going to be able to ever buy anything nice
im going to die alone"
I think we are at peak smart phone juggling by the iPhone 14
That intro was clean
Is this really being copied
Take care 
I need a new phone but cant make up my mind I am after a good camera and easy to use between pixel and the iPhone 14
I went from using the Samsung S22 ultra  and I had that for about a year Id say if not 6 months I have been using the iPhone 14 pro max and the fluidity in use is INSANE I LOVE the pill shaped notifications Its NOT the same as android  and this is my first iPhone ever after using android all of my life The connectivity and being able to text the same people from my iPad while typing and have it be connected to my iPhone is IMPRESSIVE If I had this combo during my days in college  I can honestly say college would of been so much more fun lol
Whats the case you dropped the phone in Im forced to upgrade right now so I need some good case recommendations for the 14pro
"I just wish I had a iphone pro
yes i dont want the pro max bc Im a pro "
"Why has iphone become so boring to use the 14 pro maxs dynamic island is just a gemic they have stopped innovating
Boring phone to use to be honest as now they are trying to bring stuff up thats already on Android itself on top of that they are being forced to get third party on it and typec cable"
Still a Lighting cable God dang Apple what did I expect Love the video and your thoughts
Wallpaper
Hope you didnt forget to floss P
Knee pt  All good
This pill shaped design notch i saw on android phone back in 2019
0000 this is the same song from the iPhone X review
Gosh youre too relatable
Dynamic island is an eye sore
Yeah I thought the always on display being my lock screen was weird so I just made it completely blank
"Apple doesnt have the courage to continue iPhone 13s design with performance upgrades
Steeve jobs would have absolutely hated the gimmick 14s"
I actually tried the Dynamic Island on the supposed dead zone of the display specifically the Face ID area and I actually saw it works
I was on a roller coaster at 6 flags and my iPhone 14 pro max went on crash detection mode and called the police and I did not know
Love how the globe in the back points to the Dynamic Island Lovely detail 
No one ever copied its Dynamic island
Ive had the 14 Pro Max since launch There are times when Id actually rather just have the notch back The stupid island is more of an eyesore Especially in full screen video playback Its more distracting because there is still screen space behind it At least the notch was completely black behind it I dont use the island for anything at all I guess notifications come out of it but that animation could have been done on the notch too The island also has a light ring around it that isnt utilized at all It could function as a notification LED but on the iPhone its just a little light that serves no purpose other than to outline the island at times 
Bro your ape nft logo is dope
hes one of the few people who cater for the full screen option this guy is fucking amazing
How to turn off auto enhance plz help me
Not a fan of dynamic island it gets weird when youre watching a video on your phone like its getting in the middle of your video
loved honest review here  first of all no matter your hand size is or mobile model you on you have to use both hands to use dynamic island i feel its better to switch apps using recents  task manager instead just a swipe it takes plus it makes front camera full of fingerprints
I have a 12 should I upgrade to a 14 pro Before the usbc comes in
Bro u the best YouTuber 
Just got this 
I definitely think that the crash detection is a bit too sensitive My dad has it in his phone and we were out for a bike ride he fell off his bike not too bad no scrapes or bumps or anything and the crash detection went off
That was an excellent video
Anyone knows where I can get the wallpaper from the thumbnail
I am going to be getting this as its future proof havent had a new iPhone in like 7 years
Can you link that wallpaper 
Amezing apple 
"put it in a RC car and crash It
Hahahah to test the crash test"
Only if the 48MP isnt just tied down to RAW Let us use it even in jpg format
Thanks for the review This life is temporary and you maybe dont know where youre going after unless youre a believer already Repent and believe in Jesus Christ to be saved
"I am youtuber 
   
    
           "
woah that wallpaper where can I get that
You are awesome
"He was right It was copied Im using Dynamic Island on my s22 Ultra using a app called Dynamic Spot 
Does exactly what Dynamic Island does"
I absolutely love Always on Display  Do not care about custumizatons I like waking up and looking over too see the time without touching the phone  I think it is a wondeful feature without the customizations
Bro I loved this video SO MUCH I really hope you do mores
"I havent owned iPhone since iPhone 5 i felt iPhone went downhill after iPhone 6 came out and here we are today with ridiculous pricings 

I do have to admit it looks good thought but it aint worth the price"
So its been a couple of months now and it doesnt seem like its bene copied
They needed that satellite feature in the movie Fall 
should i go with deep purple of space black or wtv
"Bezels are still thick 
iPhones are too heavy and thick now Need to get rid of dynamic island Always on display will drain battery anyways
The cameras are far too huge and only looks aesthetic on the pro max

We need thinner lighter iPhones without these ugly ass bezels and dynamic islands"
"Best thin black cases for iPhones That protect it well and dont add a lot of weight

That wont scratch or f up heaps"
Go guys buy your new lame overpriced iphone
Yeah for how small of a feature it seems I love the dynamic island and am excited to see what the future holds for it
Watching this on my space black iPhone 14 pro max 
Anyone know where did marques get the iphone wallpaper from
S20 better
i went from the 5 to the 10 and i was gonna wait for the 15 but that space black really reminded my of my favourite design and colour slate black 5 so i ended up buying the 14 pro Definitely feels like a great update for me and again really love the darkness of the black especially on the stainless steel band
Dynamic island is an after thought just to hide those hideous holes
"Hey Guys welcome to my channel sk tech 
Pls visit my channel "
I guess you could make a shortcut that turns on the Reduce White Point whenever it goes to sleep I dont have one so idk
Me watching the review on an iPhone 11
it surprisingly works really well i love it its a really clever solution to a problem they had and turned it around into more of a feature  QOL improvement rather than a problem
Love the new iPhone 14 pro Only thing that bothers me with the always on display is the little locked icon
Noooo for the love of good i can already see how it will ruin so many games if others copy this crap
"1425
Then the one we had on the 12 Pro  He was meant to say 13 Pro"
How much of the screen is actually not apart of the screen because of the DI I think this is just one step too gimmicky I dont think many phone manufacturers are willing to remove a chunk of their HD or UHDHDR screen just because Apple did it
I just upgraded to this from the 8 Yall KNOW Im in awe
i want to know whats the difference between usa and singapore version
I have a iPhone 11 I just upgraded to the 14 pro I feel I wasted money after this review 
If youre coming from an 11 pro or before its worth the upgrade I loved my 11 pro but I knew it needed a bit more
do you still believe it will be copied
Hello Brownlee Please share your analytical opinion about which iPhone 14 pro variant is best to buy Also does Chinese version iPhone 14 pro is better as having two physical SIMs compared to other hybrid variants across the globe
REPENT and receive life from Christ and be saved in Jesus mighty name amen
"Hi Marques

Great review
Need a help from you

I currently have Iphone 12 128 GB  and I am considering an update just because of memory limitations  Need a 512 gb memory  So in your opinion is it worth upgrading to Iphone 14 Pro 512 gb or can I save some money by just upgrading to Iphone 13 Pro 512 gb"
1249 noooo not the fingerprint
The main reason Ill be turning always on display off the millisecond I get a new phone is that OLEDs are more susceptible to image retention and the nonexistent advantage of the always on display clearly doesnt outweigh that risk
Also another upgrade not mentioned from the 13 to the 14 is that the iPhone 14 turns on 2 seconds faster than the 13 yes I have personally tested this  your welcome for this very useful information 
Nobody copied dynamic island tho
Any idea if iPhone 14 pro will be releasing a new color green this spring
This is something I would upgrade to from my 12 mini
Where you got that wallpaper
307 people literally are saving money to buy it and Marques Casually drops it on purpose
I know people are saying that the iPhone 14 Pro looks the same as the 13 Pro which is why I got the Deep purple since you know 13 doesnt have the colour plus its one my favourite colours also it does depend on the lighting if your in the dark it just looks like the Midnight black colour but if your in the sun or the light its deep purple
Just got my iPhone 14 Pro Max today I had the iPhone 12 Pro Max and I got to say this is a big ass leap The screen and camera being the mejor changes besides the dynamic island First time I got the gold in a while too Feels heavier and I like it all
"I am back here after 4 months
which all oem copied the design bro"
Does messenger work with dynamic island
" iPhone 14 Pro Review This Will Be Copied

Upon seeing the upcoming Android flagships this title aged like milk seriously though Android manufacturers already figured out how to design a phone that can carry a proximity sensor a selfie camera and a light sensor without adding additional punch hole let alone a giant pill shaped abomination that sticks out like a sore thumb besides Android has for so long figured out how do functional notifications icon in their UI Apple has yet to figure out how to put an actual fast charging in their phones"
Roller coasters have loud noises and are very good as simulating a car crash which is sorta a problem
To the point review good stuff
Bro casually dropped a worth of two kidneys
Give as the price
I saw Born Sinner easy subscribe
What wallpaper and where u get
Apple is the only brand that can go away with such a disgusting notch And people do actually praise it Unbelievable
Is it worth upgrading from a 11 I really like the purple color but if its not worth it Ill wait for another upgrade
Im gonna keep my 12 pro for about 45 tears no joke
What wallpaper is that 138 cos I really want it
A loyal dog for samsung
Should I get this or wait for iPhone 15
Create problems to sell solutions later Genius
some other youtubers have already tested the crash detection and I mean yeah the dynamic island is cool and there are plenty of better ways it could have been done that being a hole punch instead of a pill because the pill is still huge
Marquis i dont usually comment but that intro was just insane 
Watching from my iPhone 14 pro black
what wallpaper is that
The beautiful Smartphone ever made 
Thinking bout upgrading from the Samsung galaxy s10e to the iPhone 14 pro but idk theyre both pretty similar specs wise 
No more inovation from Apple again and again
i was going to switch to iphone 14 pro from my s22 ultra but imho its not a big enough upgrade over the iphone 13 pro  i love my s22 ultra so im sticking with it
So many little advertisements embedded in one video 
Solid review done with charm
Can u share the wallpaper or where I can buy it
I was just thinking that coz I actually had an LG V10 loved it Back in the day it was awesome 
its always about the cameracan we just have a battery that doesnt die after a year or two of use I dont want to buy the current iphone until 10 years after using my current phone
Dynamic Island Seriously Its a ugly looking notch
I have a xr but I dont know what to do if I should get the 13 or 14 pro
Thankfully it wasnt copied 
So iPhone 14 pro with 256  storage or 14 pro max with the 128 Giga  Pls help
I just switched to iPhone after 10years hanging with samsung and I what I realised at first how quick and responsive this thing is
Ok so Im going to stick with my 11 for a bit longer
The only thing that was copied from this phone was the iphone 13
I was testing the stabilization fetcher and it works really good because I was shaking my phone as violently as a could and I just kept it dead center
"HOPEFULLY no variation mess anymore
 iPhone Mini as normal iPhone for small hands kids girls iPhones had small screens for a decade
 iPhone Pro
 iPhone Pro Max
3 variations DONE"
This will be copied bro have u seen samsung s10 plus 5g pill shaped hole 
i wonder if the camera will get dirty because youll be touching it very often
Island is just the notification bar from android
remote coltrol toy car to test crash detection
Can turn off the AOD and the island things
Id be happy is Android could copy the way Apple handles notifications So stupid I can open my messaging app not read all the messages but the app badge disappears like I have no unread messages Who the fuck thought that was smart Same for phone calls  and emails
So u broke the nda smhno wonder we use to bully u in highschool Marques brownlee
We are already seeing false triggers with crash detection on roller coasters
can somebody please link me this wallpaper
Im going from a 12 pro to a 14 pro shortly waiting on UPS
Thank you Great video  I recently bought the Max pro 14 for photography and Im so happy with it  I have pro Nikons and other cameras  Low the control and depth of field  Very robust for the price and have to remember its a phone  Lol love your channel
Super
Jesus Loves You So So Much Hes Coming Soon 
No this will NOT be copied And even if it does get copied it wont last
The IDIOTS at Apple incessantly striving to thwartprevent JailBreaking coupled with them nixing the physical SIM tray finally caused me to switch to a Samsung Galaxy
Watching this on an iPhone 12 doesnt explain anything tbh 
Forgot about the battery
No body copy something already copied
Dynamic Island fingerprint central On your camera Er nah
nobody copied
I just ordered the iPhone 14 pro 1 terabyte
No offense but theres absolutely nothing on that phone that I would want and that my S22 Ultra doesnt already have
"Question for the community

I have iPhone 11 128GB which works fine no issues 

Can upgrade to iPhone 14 Pro 128GB for C690 or iPhone 14 Pro 256GB for C830 through work discount

Would you recommend making the switch or holding off for newer releases"
Impressive this model I honestly wouldnt mind having
What widgets are you using in this specific video Thank you
I got an iPhone 14 pro and the dynamic island isnt really all that
I just like listening to Marques as he critiques the iPhone or for that matter any item  He really has an amazing way of keeping ones interest in whatever hes critiquing
Here from the future I love this phone
I dont like the pill
BALLS REAL
The phone is meh stop over hyping bro
Just got mine Love it
"The best YouTuber on the internet Taste attention to details and so on
Ive Never had an iphone My last phone was the S22 ultra Shall I try it"
Whats the widget on the lockscreen the dot dot dot
its literally just a cool animation maybe ut saves you a tiny bit of time but im just amazed how well apple made this look like the biggest thing ever 
"Hi marques hope you are doing good
I would like to know about iphone 14 pro max is it still worth to buy as ive heard about the hardware and softwarebugs issues
Let me know which is best comparing iphone 13 pro max and 14 pro max
Please advise me friends which will be better in terms of all aspects like battery camera and sound"
Why there is no pause button while recording video on I phone 
Cool stuff how much does it cost
Just picked up this phone today Absolutely loving it Also love the content keep it up
A16 is not a 4 nm system at all Its just based on Improved 5nm system Its a fake advertisement
If only Marques had a rollercoaster in the studio
Been living with iphone 14 pro since launch Came from s10 Ive lost a lot of features compared to a 4 year old  samsung I miss the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor The iphone feels quality but as per Apples software is the opposite to their hardware Il be nice and say Im Going back to android
Any insight on what he means by This will be copied
I havent gotten a new phone since the 11 Waiting 34 years really makes all the small improvement add up and actually feel like a new phone
143 whats the widget on the Lock Screen 
why should this be copied many phones already got rid of the notch and just have a small hole apple is backward in many components and overprized its just the name that is expensive
Where do you get your wall papers at
dayum marques lee is so sexy haha even as a straight guy girls must be drooling over him
The only thing better than android on iphones are animations when closing or opening an app everything else sucks though
now you have a front camera full of fingerprints i cant see how people actually find the dynamic island better than the regular notch
The upgrade from the XS will def be worth it for me
Its 1400 USD in Sweden
Well guess the iPhone 13 is gonna be last iPhone I ever get Really dumb decision imo to get rid of the sim tray imo
nothing new
In my opinion i think that The Dynamic Island would look better if it had a Pill  Hole Punch because if you look at MKBHDs video about IPhone Peak the thumbnail of the iPhone is so Beautiful
Nice 12500 wire transfer 1114
That intro was smooth I like it
The longest review ever
Markus how is it possible that you missed the strange battery consumption patterns of this phone Apple claims 1 more hour longer battery life than the previous model 13 pro max if you playback video On the other hand when you stream video over wifi or play music then battery life is the same  And yet when you start using it as a phone calling or use gps location the battery just melts away It is draining so fast that is unreal I came from 11 pro max so I was expecting greater battery life Instead I am shocked There is something wrong with the amount of power the radio cellular  gps and the screen consume How is it possible that you have missed such a thing if you were using it daily How is it possible that you didnt mention it Personally I am following you for years because I consider you the most complete objective and detailed reviewer I TRUST your opinion This is the reason why I had to reach out I am not thrashing at you I feel let down and I wanted to let you know so you can consider it for future reference if you believe my comment is valid Thank you for all the wonderful content you put out there
That dynamic island isnt the s10  Like camera module  
Also if you guys dislike the always on display you can go into settings search for side button and you can change it from there
1251 It can be touch sensitive on top of the cutouts because the digitizer is always separate from the actual display panel but because of lamination we cant separate them but inherently the touch part and the display part are separate therefore it could be touch sensitive on the selfie camera itself
Please do a review on the Xiaomi 13 and 13 pro  
I was going to upgrade from 12 pro max but decided to wait as my 12 is in excellent condition for the 14 pro  this video definitely made my mind up thank you
Just got the 14 pro  pretty great phone 
That Gmail counter man xD
Im done with iphone my husband has the latest galaxy and he takes close up pictures lf the moon where u can see the craters pretty well supper insane quality i cant do that with iphone lol
I dont know how stupid the YouTube reviewers are that pill is already implemented in Samsung and huawei devices and still this idiots are praising apple for their implementation Have some sense before reviewing something
Amazing
Apple never impressed me
IPhones are trash
The safety features are impressive We do plenty of road tripping with our truck and camper where we dont get a cell signal  the satellite bit in the event of an emergency sold me on going with my 14 Pro I hope to never use it but knowings its there is cool
1600 I hope you smashed that bug after recording it
I finally did it Im watchin an MKBHD video about the latest best iPhone on that same phone I wish i could find the comment i made about this years ago
Im waiting for Zenfone Max Pro M3 under 14k INR  Im using Zenfone Max Pro M1 since 2019 and its great
again and again
Should I upgrade from the find X5 pro to this
I am upgrading to iPhone 14 pro from my Galaxy note 9 in January I hope its a best buy
Can someone please give me advice in regards to whether it is better to buy Iphone 13 Pro Max or the Iphone 14 Pro
Soon will upgrade to 14 pro max or 14 pro  cant wait and I am ready to jump from my XR space grey 
I upgraded from iPhone 8 Plus to 14 Pro Its such a big difference So here I am
I called the dynamic island the pill
you know he lives in NJ because he has the Wawa app lmao
Charged it yesterday for the first time very nice Went out and left it at at home Back this afternoon and went to text some of my friends my new number Well I couldnt  FLAT AS A PANCAKE after one day of doing nothing Same old Apple Honestly  what if you had an emergency Dont chuck away your Nokia
Guys Im upgrading from the XR to the 14 pro Whatre the biggest improvements Im going to notice
i have an iphone 8 that annoys me ill be on a call and say bye to the person and screen doesnt light up so i can flipping end call until like couple of seconds later and then the screen works and i can end call its down to the sensor i cover where the speaker and front camera is i have now just ordered the iphone 14 pro silver and cant wait and i dont really need an upgrade but its nice i not long got a gold apple series 7 cellular watch with silver milanese strap i want a macbook pro 14 or 16 but i think i should wait as i wont choose the 13 or older macbooks i have a 2010 i3 imac i use now and again
I am SO excited to get this phone Ive got it ordered and its on the way I got a gold 256GB Pro and it should be here in a few days and Ive never been more genuinely excited for a phone Upgrading from an 11 so its kind of a substantial upgrade you could say
I want to test crash detection by going on a rollercoaster because it goes from a high speed to zero at the end and most rollercoasters shake aggressively lmao
Best Christmas present  I just received
No
I put this phone on my Christmas wish list but I didnt get it I guess I wont be getting it
Im to the point that I dont think apple can just do a dot like everyone else Sad cuz ive been wanting to leave samsung If the ever fix the notchdynamic island to a dot I would like to get the iphone airpods pro2 and the apple watch ultra But I doubt this will ever happen before I die Im 51 yrs old and I have wanted an apple since I was in my 30s hence ill be dead and gone before they just get a dot instead of the notchdynamic island It takes a way toooooo much screen real estate I like to watch videos like this one play video games and sometimes watch movies oh well guess it wasnt meant to be
In my opinion the most important thing is probably the satellite signalconnectivity
I have a Samsung A03 that has a 48MP Main Camera but isnt using a Sony image sensor ofc and the problem is that when I enable the 48MP Mode in Aspect Ratio settings I usually cannot shoot some lowlight photos Might be a bug or not but Im impressed with the 14 Pros Camera  ProRAW and Cinematic Mode
555  Nice move Marques 
I hope you unalived that lanternfly after
Too much info is being given from phones
I like your clothes can i buy it 
I remember being so excited when the 11 came out cause we finally got purple to the iPhone however Im a much bigger fan of this darker shade of purple
Stop making useless promotional videos for iPhones Click unlike if Marques keeps making the video There is no point in doing such videos because Apple is not going to introduce new technologies when people keep buying the same stuff Stop Stop Stop spoils Apples management Push them to do the right thing reinnovate themselves
That intro is 
Jvjc fkudndkd
Best review Ive watched  I have the iPhone 7 Plus 128gb  I was going to wait until next year to upgrade but after watching your review decided to  to get the iPhone 14 Pro Max tomorrow since I want the bigger screen  You got a new subscriber
If you have a iPhone 12 or 13 there is no reason to upgrade
Crazy how I keep coming back to this video constantly considering I already have my 14 Pro
the way iPhones darkens people with black skins isnt cool at all
False triggers when I got Covid my heart was going so fast it timed it because it thought I was working out lol
Apple made the notch into a distraction rather a eyesore   Most phones just have a small hole punch so there wont be any use to copy Apple
No SIM card tray is aggressively evil
Oh man Im so excited to receive mine after my 8 just decided to die on me
his voice is annoying
Such a gimmick
E sim only lol  I cant with apple
Im really happy that it looks like the 12 and 13 I love that design
Big problem with sim related issue in my iphone 14 pro with calling n usage of data mostly phone stuck on call n shows no sim
Now I can record school fights without the camera shaking
MKB Awesome videoLove the great shots of the beautiful fur baby and Thanks for keeping it honest as alwaysDeb
Only apple can sell dog shit with apple logo and dumb customers will buy it
apple copy this notch from galaxy s10 plus  true copycat 
Big huge issues with the latest iOS Sim missing default to SOS Text no notification
Ive had the crash detection accidentally go off when running into my house after an Uber dropped me off
Me watching a review of the 14 pro pro max with mine after I bought it after years of being an android user lol feels good
Thank you for your review
Your videos are so good mate made me buy the 14 pro again Last time i bought the 13 because of you haha keep it up
Theres just really no need to upgrade anymore The technological advancements from apple these last few generations are just not worth it I wont be upgrading until the next somewhat groundbreaking feature
But its not that copied ss u and others expected it
I just upgraded to the 14 Pro w512 from an 8 Plus w64 Yep  an 8 and it was still working with some inconvenience but worked fine 14 is wicked fast  From what I had
Hi bro how many years I tell you give me one iphone you are not good YouTubers I think you fake
In like 18 months every android phone is copying it now lmao
Always the best reviews Thanks man
If only the iPhone 14 Plus has the dynamic island 
"Hello buddy  
 First of all lots of love from India 
Love watching your videos  your opinions are by far the best I could find on this platform  I will jump straight to the  question I have in mind  Please help me take the right way here 

I am currently using a  S22 ultra along with an iphone 14 plus  I was wondering to sell off these two devices in order to go for the iPhone 14 pro  Will it be  legitimate trade off from nearly the best of both worlds for one  Is it worth it and would I find it to be a noticeable jump up 
Please help me  I am really confused on this "
you cant rapair any iphone 14 So why ifixit
iPhone 13 Pro
I dont really want to buy yet but my battery runs out every 4 hours
I need a 3xLt hoodie
Whoah Apple IMPROVED fixablility on their phone Are we sure that went into the production models and not just the demo phones
Hi Marques You probably wont see this or even read this but where do you find your wallpapers that you put on your phones I love them and I would really appreciate it if you could respond Amazing videos marques
for the satelite issue if you KNOW you will go to some stranded place and MIGHT have an emergency I do think you should take satelite phone or some other rescue device and not wait till 2022 for Apple to release that feature in a new phone either way another over arketing of an average upgrade
Is anyone else experiencing heating issues next to camera on an iPhone 14 pro Its driving me mad
Damn I want this Hoodie
Im interested about the ESim since its a new feature on the iPhone Im curious how will it affect when you travel to another country Since its only US does that mean your carrier must include whichever country youre going to without being charged
IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE RIGHT TO PROTEST AND FREE SPEECH DO NOT GET AN IPHONE
Chevron Hoodie come on  Do you really one to be a poster boy for Chevron  Come on wow  Do you really need much more money than you are already making with you stellur reviews  It just looks like you are being seduced by the excesses of Capitalism and it is not a good look sorry  I would not even consider wearing such a hoodie which represent big oil companies and how they have exploited the market recently with obscene profits   It makes me look at you a little differently Margues and it is a little sad
Is there any way to clear purchase history permanently on your App Store Please understand my question not hide deleted permanently
Am i the only one that has battery issues with my IPhone 14 pro It loses 1 every 5 minutes or so
Many reviewers bash the always on display for being too bright and mistaken it for still being on I switched from android to the iPhone 14 Pro space black and in combination with the Omber leather case and the standard background with the always on display the phone looks really gorgeous on my desk Give it a chance to get used to
" Who can help me with the best camera choice for my new smartphone Which phone should I buy get the best looking photos
1 iPhone 14
2 iPhone 14 pro
3 Google pixel 7
4 Google pixel 7 pro



Thanks in advance"
Why does it look so ugly
Will probably buy this phone in a few years when its affordable and my current phone gets old
I mean yeah those camera features are cool but I have all of that on my Pixel 7 that I got for less than 500 on sale I can tell this new iPhone will be a good phone but man the value proposition is just not there
Im FINALLY upgrading from my OG iPhone X lol I ordered the 14 pro 256gb and I cant wait for it to come in I kept hearing how awesome the cameras are and I do use my phone to shoot videos I use it as a webcam I use my phone camera A LOT and Im still rockin the iPhone X Which is ancient in phone years but honestly this thing still runs like a champ I changed the battery in it a couple years ago and the thing just works So Im hoping to get another 3 years out of the 14 pro Not 5yrs again bc it turns out you dont get shit in store credit the longer you keep your phone lol
Million views pre year you been on damn your Ludacris level consistent  Pun intended  love the review getting it
Imainge having your iPhone 14 in your pocket and you fall over and you got up and carried on waking next thing a helicopter lands in front of you 
1803 i would know 
Im definitely thinking of upgrading to this bc my XR that Im watching this on is cracked on the back and slightly bent
Make a video about your iphone case and accessories
Watching it on my 14Pro Max Deep Purple 
I think Dynamic Island sounds awesome Why are so many reviewers saying its cringe Dont get it
"Hi
When i click photos from my 14 pro for the first 3 seconds I see an almost great image and then it auto enhances and applies some sort of effect which completely ruins the photo every single time sharpened I have attached 2 samples of how it looks 
how does one fix this
PIs help
I am on iOS 1612"
I really love the dynamic island wish they did a sort of dynamic notch for the regular 14 because the dynamic part is purely software but this is outstanding and i love it
"There is nothing of interest in this upgrade I guess Ill wait for the 15

Hope your knee is all better saw the pt on your screen "
Here comes more future tyranny First the batteries now ESim To make it harder for you to change sims when in another country They realy want to take your liberty Coming to a country near you sponsored by the Nw Wrld rder
Got it Last October Its awesome 
I just ran to Target to get an emergency 14 Pro case because the 13 Pro did not fit
Lol
Switching from a Samsung Galaxy S10e hoping its worth
"The car crash detection is definitely a good feature but it has one problem

What if your phone breaks in the crash"
Never forget the LG V10 Honestly my favorite smartphone ive ever owned
"When and why did tho become so over used
Growing up and it was likethen you know what Im sayingnow its tho

I guess this time MKBHD not clearly favour so much about apple produts or am I just thinking it over so many years Probably I havent watch your vid lately Good vid
Beware of paparazzi after MB in September 2023
Does anyone know where I can find the wallpaper in the picture of the video
It just works
Not trying to be racist but for an African American who likes his voice
Why no one is talking about the battery life much it is worse then 11 pro I switch to 11 pro to 14 pro the the battery I thought it will be better but its just the same 6 to 7 hours and i am really disappointed with that shit my 11 pro use to last 8 hours straight
I for one bought it cause it was on a plan and the fact that I can get 6 years out of it easy
How is the microphone on this Asking for vlogging purposes Phones prior did not do good with wind noise
I dont understand why they removed noise cancellation since iPhone 13 It was such a cool feature Every new phone instead of iPhones has that
My 150 android has the same camera specs 48 MP with a 12 MP QuadPixel option

"Me looking at the pictures taken by the iPhone on my 70 android

Wow looks great"
It cant be copied Apple own the trademark
Just upgraded from my iPhone SE 2nd gen Battery life increase is a game changer Pro motion is a game changer Screen size is a game changer Camera system is a game changer Dynamic island is neat IPhone SE feels like the first iPhone now
Im pretty sure that the car crash sensor has gone off while people are on roller coasters
Yall really go all in on these iphones lol
What happened to Filip Aka EverythingApplePro
So samsung or iPhone 
No more giveaway
Hi bro i like love and i phone 14 iam indrasted u r topic
J cole Born Sinner
Supposedly the crash detection freaks out on a roller coaster its technically a way to test it out
Watching this from iPhone 14 pro
Id love to know who else noticed he said connecting AirPods twice when hes listing the dynamic island feature
This is phone too is a copy because huawei was the first to use the notch on their phones samsung invented the always on display though theirs differ a bit Sony was the first to use water resistance on phone and so many other innovation from others like asus Google so apple is just trying to compete with them in creativity
Another reason they dont do the 8k is due to the pixel binning Shooting in 8k would cause the pixels used to be nonbinned and therefore much smaller so low light would be much worse
Lol no one will copy it lol
Im excited to get mine next month
maybe youve got a DBrand case on it 300 IQ product placement
Did NOT expect that slight shade to Appleshout out to LG 
wow thats underwhelming havent checked in on iphones in a couple years and its amazing how they make you believe youre getting something new
why would I want an iPhone always android
Ever since i found this channe ive been binging all your videos Cant wait to watch as many as possible
this is a excellent review i have 6 s  so ill notice this  bump
"Negs 
still has a notch
camera bump is huge and for some reason they still havent figured out to put it in the middle so that your phone is not wobbling all over the table when you lay it down You buy this beautiful iPhone and then you have to wrap it in a shitty plastic case so that it doesnt wobble Some people are not terribly concerned about dropping their phones because were adults and we take care of our stuff
for the love of God please get rid of the lightning cable Every other phone in the world is using USBc What is Apples effing fascination with the lightning cable It is a flimsy easily broken connection and theyre already using USBC in iPhones elsewhere in the world Please please please wake up
The lack of a SIM tray is a big problem for travelers When I traveled to Europe and Asia it was so easy to just pop a new SIM card in So now I wont be able to do that Will the people at the airport selling the SIM cards even know how to do an esim Will it even be possible Do the carriers overseas even offer eSIM service Probably not 

I just dont understand Apple Its like they build the Ferrari of smartphones and then they still insist on having a CD player with no Bluetooth functionality but it does have a 35 mm outlet so you can plug in your 20yearold technology to listen to some low res music Why TF dont they wake up and just use the modern technology thats available I could even live with the notch if they would just deal with the lightning cable and camera bump But I can only deal with so many negatives at one time You kind of want the iPhone because the quality of the case is so high but with that massive camera bump I have to put a 5 plastic shell on it  No thanks"
If u have complains just make a perfect phone oh sht u cant just talk is blackie style
Hey blackie before u say lg invented the dynamic island show people at least you can show that right edit videos
ofcourse he drives a tesla
I wonder if a roller coaster that goes upsidedown would trigger the crash detection
Hi Bro hope you know that there is an issue with 13 pro max voice drop to other end on speaking in speaker phones mode just to check with is this issue exists in 14 pro max I m thinking to change to phone 14 due to above issue so thought to check with you as your review are very good and correct
You pay with apple pay India pays with UPI
I have an iphone 14 pro max and my interest in the dynamic notch lasted 5 mins until i thought wow
Drop the weights in the gym and it went off
"All day battery life
My iPad I am 4 parallel universes ahead of you"
The wallpaper where can I download it
Living in south east asia never heard of Esim Its problematic specially if you travel around
Dang im still on the 11 i didnt even know the 14 was out cuxx i been done with buying iPhones im not finna pay 1000 dollars for the same exact phone with a new color n one more camera like fucc outt my face  my 11 gonna have to blow upc before i gett a new one
Does the dynamic island affect photos As you touching the camera a lot
"911 operators HATE the emergency detectorsevery report to our center has been unfounded and there is no way to call back the phone or they dont answer call back Ppl prob dont even realize it went off or they dont care cuz they dont realize we still have to send units to false reportwhich then takes away an available emergency unit from being able to respond to a real emergency 


These tech companies need to start working with emergency response reps before releasing these things 

Premature"
My iPhone 14 pro max just got its first black screen had to force reboot  They need to determine what is the cause and fix it  Over 10 years of iPhones and this is first major issue
I recently watched Fall movie  I am thankful about satellite connectivity LOL mkbhd
What a cool Dog
Why arent you talking about the most important aspect of the notch The fact that it cuts out too much of a video in full screen
Man I miss LG their phones were great ideas just sucky implementations I had nothing but LG phones my entire life now I have an iPhone XS Max
no type c but they should switch to fuly magsafe
Crash detection is often triggered by rollercoasters aswell which is kinda funny tbh
So the iPhone is always listening
Ill be honest the dynamic island is a horrid idea that I hate I really wish they would have kept the notch as there is nothing that I hate more on a phone than when the display is constantly disrupted
When the Iphone makes more steps towards astrophotography I will be very happy
"French rap from Nantes in the background  Hocus Pocus  on ans on
Yeah "
In India we are fortunate enough to get iPhone 14 pro in 1700  Wow
Apple Dynamic Island feels kinda backwards I think a tap should open the widget and then a long press open the app and that would just make more sense but no more whatevers The point is it just works right off the rip
Dont get the 14 pro worst phone of 2022 had a 12 pro and feels like a downgrade horrible battery wifi never works all my friends who got it have the same problem
If you took a screenshot on lock screen the dynamic island will capture
Dynamic Island is a scam Just remove the notch and stop with the gimmicks
Apple just patented this
That island is disgusting Cant afford it anyway 
"I used to have a V10 and loved the top screen lol 
I just got my 14 pro today was rocking a 12 pro max since launch and Im so hyped on it the dynamic island is one of the coolest features Ive seen I was tired of the massive pro max even though I have very large hands and honestly the upgrade was well well worth it especially the cameras 

Awesome vid as always keep up the good work

Edit also this screen Omg man it is buttery smooth compared to the 12PM lol"
"So yall buying a phone that serves THE SAME FUNCTION Make phone calls and text Everything else detailed wise is cool for the techs but morally Why are we so consumed by these things that will perish why not enjoy and appreciate everything else about life instead of worshipping something that will be soon obsolete I dont need my phone to tell my whole dna I just wanna call my friends every now and then

PS this isnt a bad comment intended to tear down the creator just a message of us as people We can enjoy life but geez all this materialism shouldnt be so glorified"
Feels good to watch this on a 14 pro 1010 recommended upgraded from a X 
I really like your content Congrats man
I just upgraded from my XR to a 14 pro max its literally 10x better If you have a 11 pro or less I would say upgrade for the Oled screen alone
So if I was going to get a new IPhone and I was stuck between a 13 pro and a 14 pro The dynamic island wouldnt be a sellin point MK has been jaded on tech for a while now new tech doesnt even excite him like it use to
I rather have better software than power so Apple  imo wins
Or the roller coaster ride 
We need us a MKBHD MAX S TIER thts th name of ur future phone  model rooting for u 
My wish from the bottom of my heart is to be a loyal follower Never thought about having followers Always loved being a consumer The letters have been announced Waiting for a beautiful show and falling in love forever Ameen
I got the iPhone 14 pro but youtube videos go all the way to the top of the dynamic island so I cant press the minimise button or the airplay button how do I fix 
Watching from iPhone 14pro max
King of the phone 
Cant wait to buy this January of 2023 
I upgraded from an iPhone 7 to an iPhone 14 pro max blown away by the difference
POV youre watching this on the iPhone 14 pro
does anyone know what that calendar widget is
The 14pro or 14 pro max which would be the better choice
I am thinking about buying one because I am using a IPhone 6 forevet and now if I buy it I will probably use it something like 10 years or something maybe even more and I am a lot excited about the phone but yea I think if you have IPhone 12 or 13 you its my idea shouldn t buy the 14 or 14 Pro but if you have 11 or lower again its mide opinion you can think about it
Iphone is so boring My first and probably last one is 12pro max They are releasing new one without much effort Siri is amazing but that is about it
Throw it against the wall to see if it will call emergency services
Me watching this one my Samsung Galaxy a10e
Good of you that you mentioned LGs invention of top of the screen display
"1022 
Andrew Oh I thought they wanted the clamp to be like hidden in the back"
Thank for sharing 
Ill wait another year before upgrading to the iPhone 15 Pro Max It should have the USBC port for that generation
Rollercoasters is a problem for crash detection
The most Iphone review ever a big big thumbs up to you bro
Where can I get this wallpaper
With the dynamic island  Im wondering if the touch will interfere with the physical sensors  cameras  The complete omission of updates to Siri continues to surprise me  Great review overall Markus  you make awesome content
"guys
 who can not be difficult to send to Russia"
Not the watch band tan
I dont really understand what reviewers are doing We keep on discussing phones and specs and whatsoever and I DO can understand why we do it But as a 7 year android user who just switch from an microsoft android galaxy watch climate to an mac mini macbook pro apple watch 8 iPhone 14 pro max climate I do have something to say I can not complain about osx it is a lovely thing to have The Apple watch is also meeting up with my standards But i have a huge discomfort with IOS the operating system is not even half as intuitive as Android You can tell that by many things many gestures that arent possible etc etc Why dont you do a review about that Markus Because something obviously has to be done about it In my opinion Apple isnt puttig half the effort into IOS as they should for such expensive devices and it feels like Im on an operating system from 2010
Apple went so cheap this time Its like their fall is inevitable if only android can step their game up Iphone 14 pro max ships with only one 1 meter cable and thats it Are you kidding me Just for this fact Im buying ALL my accessories from third parties What a cheap bomboclots
Thats a cool phone but still cant do many things I do on my Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 
please suggest me Should i buy iphone 13 pro max or iphone 14 pro as i am getting both phones at same price I am confused please help
A very standard review and seems pretty lazy to not test the satellite feature by driving to a remote location Slightly offended by your attitude that its perfectly okay Easy 10M view money what a world we live in
Pls does anyone know how to sponsor me for apple products and android
Wait does the music not show up on the dynamic island with Apple Music I didnt see it on the list
I just wanted the iPhone 14 Pro Max to have WiFi 6E but unfortunately it does not sad face
Warning wordle spoilers 
What size is the phone in the review is it the 61inch or 67 inch regular or max
And with 14 the 3 year apple cycle started with 12 ends
Amazing you fuck apple then you change your mind about it 
Shout out to LG phones being ahead of their time
Its apples dock eventually 
Sooooo Apple continues to add upgrades to each new version of the iPhone yet still havent added an AM and PM to the 12 hour clock Its the simple things Applethe simple things consumers appreciate My iPhone XR finally has a numerical battery percentage readout thanks to upgrading to iOS version 161 BUT Im still not going to upgrade until APPLE ADDS AN AM AND PM TO THE 12 HOUR CLOCK Geez How difficult does Apple have to be to provide consumers with the simple things
In car crash feature Will it do the taking to the emergency service Id probably be too dead to talk to them
This dudes a shill
bro i look uglier than i am really are after i take pictures with this phone is this normal and the problem is that the picture looks fine when Im taking it before clicking the fkcn button
Russia are bombing schools  hospitals and all types of  civilian targets We are debating 60 vs 120 hz refresh ratesOf a mobile phone which prize would save the lives of many people in for example Jemen
Wallpaper please
The satellite connectivity is not just for emergency cases  Im looking forward to testing it out  I do a lot of hiking and often times will be without cellular signal for days  I have a Garmin inReach mini that I have to pay a service fee for that lets me send texts via satellite and also send SOS in case of an actual emergency  Thankfully I have never had to send the SOS but the ability to update my wife and family each night that Im OK or if we get off schedule etc and send a GPS location to show we are on track is priceless and provides peace of mind Cant wait too see if this new iPhone feature can replace the need to bring an inReach along
Ive got a 12 Ill wait for next years Pretty good update though
The dynamic island is fucking hilarious On the one hand its a really cool feature in everyday use even tho it still looks terrible when viewing fullscreen content where they took a limitation and made the best out of it but on the other they called it dynamic island for fucks sake Thats just so apple that I started laughing out loud the first time I heard it
personally only got this upgrade from the 12 pro max because mine was stolen but Im definitely not complaining about these quality of life updates
Lets be real Iphones will always be the best
Probably first time I have see  mistake in intro editing Stand to hold the phone was still visible Its not biggest mistake but the way in which you give attention to details in intro shot This was surprising for me
From iPhone 5s to 14pro the video quality drastically changed in this channel 
I have an iPhone SE and just got this one very excited 
Creepy spyware n
A few years ago I made the decision of switching phones every 35 years depends and always going for the largest storage option available No regrets yet
So what do I do If I have to travel internationally
Apple  new phone every year is this really necessary  long live capitalism feeding the global conglomerate buying unnecessary crap so you can get that shot of dopamine and on to the next one
30 of this video also talked about the cameras lol
Nov12022 update COVID19 breakout and sperade in Foxonn factory located in Zhengzhou province China this factory produced most of the apple iphone product on the market approx 300K yong workers were locked inside the factory and with very few medical and food support form Foxconn and Chinese goverment they need hepl right now
I have an iPhone 13
How is the battery life compared to 13 pro and 13
The apple way doesnt mean A damn thing
Man its same phone with small upgrades
New  Design but is the same design of the new design but its the same design
That ugly a notch
How is the battery with the new iphone and new ios compared to the oldre with the older ios 152 
Iphone is a Android with less features
I and all of scandanavia  finnland are working on making the first angler phone you should join youve recycled enough
"Ehm no it doesnt really know whether youve been in a car crash crash detection can be activated by a rollercoaster

And honestly if Im gonna go into the wilderness Id prefer to have a regular satellite phone for a reliable signal to actually make phone calls Sure having it on the iPhone is something at least but yeah dont rely on it"
If yall dont like it then dont buy it Why jump on YouTube and bash something you dont have to buy
"Youve become my favorite phone reviewer
Aside from this I just upgraded from my 12 Pro Max to the 14 Max and I love it 
The Dynamic Island is fun and definitely the camera feels even better Ive been taking more pictures than Ive ever had lol 
Thanks for a great review D"
iPhone is dead
I can care less about Apple products Its your delivery that hooked me
excellent review
That wrist watch tan line though
What calendar widget is he using on his Lock Screen
I REALLY ENJOY YOUR REVIEWS EVERY TIME I WATCH YOUR RELEASED VIDEOS I WOULD ENJOY THEM MORE ON A NEW PHONE  BROKEN PHONE WATCHING ALL THE WAY FROM ZAMBIA
Please tell me you killed the Lantern Fly at 1600
only huawei will copied the sausage mode   their flagship has a notch   most brand already minimize  to a mole
How does this Pro word justifies if you dont have mixing volume level panel available to adjust the volume while talking on call and watching media at the same time Quite not a Pro phone
Do not lie about battery performance Its rude
For me the AOD from Samsung and Huawei are on top But for normal users AOD on any phone works well For me its something that I dont use so if I can turn it off on iphone then its all good for me xD
Always very nice review and providing explanations in simple terms for the less techies out here Thank you
How The Hell Did They Do That Intro Oh My God
"Well tbh the title should be This Is Copied 

Because Huawei have already done this dynamic island kinda thing back in 2018 with their Huawei View 20 or V20 phone
And apple as usual copying things and presenting it as their own "
Does anyone know where I can find that wallpaper that is in the intro for the iPhone 14 I have looked everywhere for it and cant find it
iPhone really do be hitting with the same with same first the iPhone and then the ipad
The dynamic main frame sounds better
Can you give me one iPhone 14 pro
People work at iPhone factory escaping from harsh environment and still ripping off customers Nice Apple Not Me
"BroApple COPIED others
Recall Honor V20 that was released 4 years ago
That was the first few corner cam that play around with that pinhole or notch etc
Even LG before they left the market also were the few that played with this

I dont know why but your reviews seem to bend more and more towards Apples favor nowadays instead of being a fair one"
coolest intro
turns out a roller coaster will trigger the crash detection lol
THAT fucken intro had style my dude
Im gunna pass iPhone 15 will be lighter zero bezel and usbc
The iPhone X has the best design and feel
I like ZTE No notch at all Their tech for the under screen camera is getting so much better
I would say if your looking to upgrade to the 14 ProPro Max if you have the iPhone 12 Pro Max and down Id say its worth it If you have the 13 ProPro Max Id give it a bit
No I hope they dont copy this This is just ugly I hope companies like Asus will keep doing the flip camera
P
"Their take on the notch is very smart and kind of cool But it does not save it from looking artrocious most of the time
They somehow made something even MORE visually annoying than their previous massive notch "
I have an iPhone 8 Plus sooo everything is an upgraded
just got the iphone 14 pro anyone facing front camera over processing issue my 14 pro photos are way worse than my iphone 13
I can think of some great ads with Halloween and satellite service
How Marques softly gently gets his ideas into your system sippingly 
Ill just stick with my 13 pro max for this year and wait until next year
What if u drop ur phone and 911 shows up
Wait so are you using the lg v10 right now Or are you using the 14 pro I think I know the answer to that You people are so annoying with this apple does everything late bs Never mind if they take their time and release a far superior product
Im a Samsung user freak but not gonna lie i prefer iphone camera wise The quality is the best for my eyes prferences Planning to grab iphone 14 pro soon
With regards to the new phones brightness would using Accessibility  Zoom and changing the filter to Low Light work to save battery because the screen is way dimmer or use more battery because youre dimming it through a secondary means
That intro was absolutely insane Apple should hire you to make their commercials
I disagree I just upgraded from the iPhone 11 Pro Max and its a night and day difference I have the iPhone 14 Pro Max now and its such an improvement saying its only a minor upgrade doesnt do it justice if you have what I have and are on the fence I cant recommend the phone enough the quality of life improvements are unreal
Living in Australia and going on camping trips in the middle of literally nowhere the satellite connection for emergencies may be what convinces me to get the 14 over the 13
i just want a clock to be shown on the always on display not the whole lock screen 
Good phone
1813 the tan line I get tan lines like that during the summer Im Latino and I live in Washington State and an hour or two a day Ill get very tan too
Just upgraded from the Xs and very nice upgrade worth the price
Why is it priceee
What is slightly less battery life with the always on display on Like 1 a charge
Just noticed the little hint to his toxic trait of getting todo list
Random note but seeing Kanye West album covers just makes me sad now
So yoi can use that for a e sim
Lycamobile is for every country
Hey so Ive been an android user all my life and currently have an s21 ultra But Im kinda curious about apple Should I  finally give the ecosystem a try
mkb always finds a way to make me wanna resub
Godfather of tech product reviews never miss a beat 
2 corrections 1 The iPhone 14 pro does not fit into 13 pro cases 2 Cinematic mode has always been 30fps but it maxed out at 1080p on the 13s
Can you inform me how to download youtube videos in iPhone 14 p max
works chockfull thanks
I just bought a 14 pro max The camera on 13 pro max looks far more bright and vibrant Im not sure if this is just my phone being defective or is this with all the 14 pros
YAM
I wish i have that 
Apple copies lots of stuff just modified the dynamic island from the LG V20 and its amazing how the world see this as a new thing just like apple was late coping the always display and when it copied it everybody made news about it I hate Apple if it was an example in the life he would be the coping student that copies another students and the teacher rewards him over the owners of the ideas
If you want to upgrade from a 1413 or even a 12 then might not be worth it But coming from an 8 plus HOLY WOW MUCH FEATURES Even mag safe is new to me
With the dynamic island cutting into 21 content you think youll do content on a less wide aspect ratio Maybe not 169 but with half of the pill cutting into the content why not right
Thier brain stopped working after the iPhone X
Please give me free iphone please 
Link to the wallpapers please
"lets be honest when was apple not
copied by everyone else this shows how far ahead apple is against the competition"
Android is dead
So Patrick Cloud
" ONE BIG PILL  im dead
"
Keep jethalal wallpaper 
dynamic island is needed I think to make the phone unique im loving it and it makes the phone stand out
 136 what widget is that the first one from the left  I cant seem to find it
"Apple is just milking us at this point This phone is just as dead as the previous one The type c usb port and 8k video as well as storage space were the most valid points of this video They are charging 200 for extra storage on the phone thats a robbery
What I truly dont understand is WHAT ARE THEY ROBBING US FOR You are already the richest company in the world how much more money do you want Ew"
The Hoodie looks like shit lmao
What is your personal daily phone
I must say your intro looks better than apples
Got one yesterday from having a iPhone 12
Give me the same but with type C and Ill take two Otherwise thanks but no thanks
I tried watching your videos I just cant do it your voice is like nails on a chalkboard besides iPhone every year they come with we upgraded such and such and blah blah blah to charge you more money for the same thing
what is the first widget on the left the one with the dots
940 Thank you for that detail Take my up vote
Apple users when Apple releases their newest phone at flagship price with the same performance as a Google pixel for 300
Can anyone tell me on the name of the lock screen widgets The dotted one especially Is that the calendar app
Terrible the battery And that dynamic island is so distracting when you play a game or watch a movie  I felt that describing the phone you seems a little bit sad This is really the new iPhone that you didnt expected A little bit off
Dude your intros are literally the best Youre in a league of your own
I have a major question Is iPhone 14 pro or iPhone 14 pro max can use for gaming
I currently have an iPhone 7 plus and looking into upgrading to the iPhone 14 pro but a friend said its more worth to just do iPhone 13 Pro or just wait for the iPhone 15 What do you guys think on this
"Hello 
I am between choosing a 13 pro max 256b at 1250 or an iPhone 14 pro 256gb for 1385 I am completely torn I really like the bigger size and battery but I would also like to have the new camera 48mp Which one would you thing is the better value long term Will the 13 pro max battery health decay a lot slower though the years  What would you choose considering specs and pricing  also with the 13 pro max I get a free apple silicon case that costs 55 for all that matters"
Ive been with Apple since the iPhone X to the 13 pro Apple is simple but boring I moved over to the s22 ultra and while it was an adjustment it proved a better experience with my windows PC and Samsung electronics Things I actually use daily
Where can i find that wallpaper
Your fav food is brownies right
This apples AOD is kinda useless in my opinion Just taking away battery
Making the notch a feature is really clever UI design
Trash phone
Correct me if Im wrong but the island does not disappear from the screen when viewing in full screen How on earth is that an improvement on the notch The notch was at the edge of the screen and it never really bothered me that much but I just try to watch some on the Max with that island clearly sticking out on the screen Is there a setting for it completely disappear whilst viewing vids Thats a deal breaker for me If anything it actually makes the original notch look more appealing Big disappointment
Hey what is that wallpaper iphone on the thumbnail
chasing a subject 
stop giving 8k a platform 4k is already useless in a phone
22 Ultra Still Better xD
Okay so like I predicted Keep my iPhone 13 Pro Max and skip the 14 Got it Typical Apple lol
Was the refresh minimum of 1hz THAT hard to think of It could not have been used back in the iPhone 8
1946 look how much those cameras stick out now Yuck
IPhone is amazing the find me feature alone  it will save many lives
Oh man I miss LG phones so much they were so weird and inventive but I guess the lack of consistency and identity in the phones kinda made them a tough sell to people
The alwayson display feature sucks on iPhones and its a very very late adoption But looks like putting that on the video title as problem late Apple copying was not in your script as you always do with other brands especifically Google and on launch day
I love the wallpaper where do you get them
With the new IOS 1603 update I feel like Apple purposely dumbed the iPhone 13 Pro to 90 Hz refresh rate so the iPhone 14 Pro can shine The iPhone 13 Pro is advertised to be 120 Hz refresh rate but feels dumbed down If they did this it is wrong
Ok Im back I ordered the Black 14 pro so came back to re watch
I love watching your videos because all your videos are great and how you talk about all the tec that came out and Im a fan tho 
That intro was so well done it rivals an actual apple commercial
Should one wait for the next generation of the 15promaxultra or should one go ahead with an upgrade to the 14pro max from a xs max 
Im shocked the speakers were not talked about The speakers are a big upgrade from the past iPhones for sure
I mean the pill is a pretty big feature for me since I use customized icons When you open an app the banner popping up is pretty annoying This makes it look and feel much better
He still listens to Born Sinner
maybe apple will allow 8K video in a future software update i think its possible since the hardware required for 8K video is there on the 14 Pro
But can we get a wallpaper link 
"It is funny how Android fanboys are so biased about Iphones Iphone 14 Pro Max the best phone there is if we are talking about an average person not a specific user like heavy gamer etc
No phone on earth has more than 23 better things than the Iphone We are talking about the objective things about a phone

Is there a phone with better camera Yes

1339 The fact that the iPhone is dirty in such a high quality video makes me feel bad about this video
hey good morning
The dynamic island is literally the leg v and g extra screen on the g5 and the v series All apple did was change the name This is nothing new If lag still made phones theyd be annoyed as hell that apple just ripped them off
Lg made this and apple copy it
No comment on the ugly ass rounded corners this time Lol
Anyone else notice when explaining dynamic island he said airpods twice  1115
I did think of LGs double screens but at the same time the dynamic island is still different Weve never had a marriage of software and hardware quite in this way especially considering that this is just a combination of screen cutouts and cameras theres no actual screen So I still think its innovative on Apples part
iPhone is not worth 1400 dollars  Probably 150
in italy 1489 euro rip
I just watched your Iphone 5 review Its just crazy how far tech has gotten
I wont lie the dynamic island approach was smart but most Andriod smartphones have this in a way so its not really a game changer at all its just a selling idea
God bless you again man
God bless you man good work excellent review
529 Not related what type of book is that The binding Idk what to ask google 
Recently upgraded from the 12pro to the 14pro Wish i shouldve seen this review before hand  Thank you I guess lol
"MKB if you are for some reason stranded without service
90 of Australia "
You are right about accidental crash detection Some people say that their phone called 911 while on a roller coaster So roller coasters trigger crash detection
Thats how you destroy even more usable screena big island
I have had a lot of issues with 12 Faulty receiver phone heating issue random camera freeze issue etc
"Im going to buy a new iPhone 
I come from 67 screen OnePlus 7 pro I love its big screen Good for watching YouTube But its thinner and lighter than iphone 14 pro max 

My purpose to use this iphone for video maker on YouTube Outdoor camping traveling vlog extreme sport  hiking video motorcycle vlog

My hands are small

What is the best phone for these requirements Pro or promax
 "
I might be alone in this but I prefer the notch over the island  Im not saying its a gimmick or not useful but to me its more of a distraction than the notch
24 Cinematic
"Despite your criticism and arrogance during the years for iPhones it seems to be the most sold smartphone over the years The experience and safety using an iPhone overpass these bullshit reviews 

It is like the psychology of the money all bankers say to put money somewhere else but they definitely dont say the truth No smartphone comes close to apple when talking about users experience BYE"
And if you dont get the pro you get last years chip total scam
This phone is a joke and it should have been a 13 Pro s LOL
Why would you compare the camera on this phone to the iPhone 12 thats very disingenuous because you know that this virtually no significant difference in performance to the 13 Pro
i came so close to going back to iphone and after watching this i am glad i didnt
That purple though 
1549 And here are some SD cards that you cant use on this phone
Thank you for your review of the iPhone 14 Pro I have took a lot of good information
430 lol thats no GPS satellite thats a groundsurvey or meteorological satellite
Camera bump and bazels are really big Phone design is ugly Missing Steve Jobs
In Esim case in brazil its a security metric feature to I have been stolen these days and the first thing that the robbers do is take out your sim to be harder to locate your phone it may seem harder to get a new Esim but the operators already have ways to just buy it one online and put in your cell phone Also it already supports 20 or more Esims on the same phone
NOPE still holding out until they release the  5758 mini iphone 15 Mini 
what is the name of the smartphone model 744
This notch is going to be around for many years now they will be milking this for several years to come
305 One of the smoothest product placements Ive seen
"I have issue with my iPhone 11 and its very slow stutters and crash a lot and have a call speaker to ear not working Thats the only reason going to 14pro

PS when I see my wifes iPhone 13 Pro man wish I had it So tempting"
A great advertisement video for the iPhone 13 Pro
checkmate 24fps stans 
My friend got an emergency call thingy at sic flags it detected a car crash when we were on the Rollercoaster
A technological shame if it continues Such a hefty price then there shouldnt be any notch at all
Why would I want to buy a phone without a tray for a SIM card  I could not transfer my Verizon prepaid to the useless in this case e sim I also expect problems in my travels where before I could simply transfer the SIM card but they never heard of e sim Bad move Apple
Steve jobs looking from up  the iPhones now like 
Mullan hanafi channel teebaik
Appreciate the in depth review of the iphone 14 pro
May I know what is your calendar widget app on your lockscreen
Where do you get the screensaver of the phone in the video Someone please help Ive been trying to find it for weeks
new challenge for their other competitors
i phone 1516 also will be copy From this 
I hate it remove the notch
1322 Yes LG was at the forefront of a lot of innovations but their marketing team sucked and did the bare minimum to push their products This is what happens when you dont go big you end up going home while the others will take the same thing and call it theirs
"Sus
"
ok guys so I have been on iPhone 12 for an year and a half now but I am considering an upgrade Recently I developed a keen interest to go for the 13 pro but taking into account the new 14 pro it just got me super confused If yall can suggest me should I go for 13 pro or 14 pro
I super dig the text transitions style Good idea
I feel like Apple wont do astro for a long time
Hey what is that weird different looking part on the phones in US you can see it during 340347 Ive seen that now on Samsungs and Apples phones but phones in EU doesnt have that
MKBHD is an apple fanboy and thats disappointing
I am an android guy but I gotta be honest when I went to the apple store to test out the 14 and I gotta be honest its so nice snd the dynamic island really makes it feel different then the ones with the notch
When it comes to iPhone and its late  we finally listened to customer and we finally give you something that you should be excited for even though its cringey in a way  like this island cuz we all DYING to use it all I can compare it to its like a Mariah Carey of smartphone industry its like that concert of Mariah on New Years Eve where she just couldnt bother thats what I think of when I hear iPhone 14
We need a DSLR phone Basically Sony A6100 on a phone
Yeah other companies have had features way before but aestheticly iPhone blows every company out the water which is why people love it more and will always love it  The other day I saw a brand new android at the store  The camera was clean  It looks cool   Phone works great but once you start using the phone and just swipe left and right and look at the apps It just looks old and cheap compared to how iPhone does it   Androids just needs to change their layout
Title is very likely to be true 
Guys quick question I own an iPhone X and now I want to upgrade So which iPhone should I get the 14 pro or another
Rekha
Hxirc
The island is so dumb Its literally just a pull down menu basically that you have less control over because its always there You can just switch between apps by swiping up
14 worthless c type coming soon
I love how Marques is still trying to make Techtober a thing Its so fetch   Great content as always though
i drop the phone on my bag and crash detection activated
the whole forced eSIM thing killed my hype why make it harder to connect my phone to the network I want whenever I want
iPhone 14 promax definitely a phone you should go to your Apple store and buy in my cost like 1100 and some change that phone is very expensive apple step the game android you better hurry up Apple has new features
Ive had an iPhone X for about 45 years and had to make the upgrade I love it so far after a few days and think the camera and screen quality have been huge upgrades
Pretty sad that a new phone only has a couple really new features and one of them is always the camera
The cameras do NOT need to be that big Its laughably enormous
I am a really thinking of switching from a One Plus 7T I have never been a fan of Apple for my own stupid social bs reasons and I think Im ready For those who have made the switch do you regret making the switch from Android   Im scared to be honest 
Whats that song in the beginning
Can anyone tell me the name of the intro song
Where I can download the wallpaper
When your YouTube video intro looks like a pro tv show intro mkbhd
Just ordered my 14 pro its on back order till the 17 but Im extremely excited Its my first pro model and figured Id treat myself
As someone with a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra I HATE HATE HATE the slow shutter speed I have literally missed photos because of it Someone please tell me if the iPhone 14 Pro Max has an instant response to pressing the damn button to take a picture Cheers I will seriously swap to it for this reason alone
I dont even like iphone but this was the best intro to any video I have ever seen  What is this song
Very boring phone
I wonder if the always on display turns off when it is in your pocket or if it senses that Does anyone with the 14 Pro have any answers
Eh I think Im just gonna wait for the iPhone 20
That dog chase was definitely not 28k 
I would consider buying itif it wasnt 1300 euro in Europemore expensive than the s22 ultracould find it 200 cheaper
Your explanations and reviews are really on point man love the delivery
Esim has its pros and cons I am less interested in the pros Esim can be hacked more easily then a physical sim
Ur cameras got a dirty sensor at 920 bottom right corner just thought u shuld know 
"Always on display
Should have a completely black background With notifications or iconswidgets of apps that you want showing on there in black and white"
Pro tip that Im surprised more reviewers dont talk about Turn your phone to dark mode Turns the OS mostly black instead of mostly white OLED screen means those pixels arent using any power Boom overcompensation for the always on display My 14 pro max lasts 2 days with average usage and I literally have to try my best to kill it in one day with extreme usage and pretty high brightness
"Should I buy a brand new iPhone 13 Pro Max and get 250 in gift cards at Costco or get the new iPhone 14 Pro Max
That 250 off makes me seriously consider the 13 Plus its also 100 less than the 14 Pro Max"
How about the repairability
1994 shit F u apple  I have a cock you know what 2 do Devolutiontake a walk READ A BOOK Read a MOTHER TRUCKING BOOK
Even though the dynamic island is a true software innovation after all the hype I cant look at this size of a holepunch no matter how fluid it animates Also a big drawback for me is this under direct light showing the actual enormous holes to users eyes
Nice review as usual and ngl im in love with that hoodie bro  I
You make very good videos Very professional and informative without all that clickbait stuff
Just upgraded from the 11 pro and the difference and user experience is so much better Couldnt recommend this upgrade enough
MBKHD  the island bars is cool but you have to constantly clean the front camera because youve been touching it
I want one so bad 
Im probably taking my 14 back I use an iPhone for work and an Android when Im off Supposedly you could switch the esim back and forth on ATT but now they say you cant Its pretty infuriating and I dont know if Im more mad at Apple or ATT I dont know how tech youtubers are going to deal with this either How are they going to switch phones
am i being weird or once he was naming the things the dynamic island does he said connecting AirPods twice
Hey I was playing golf and when I hit the ball my Apple Watch series 7 and my Apple 14 pro asked me if I fell down Hahaha
Yo  quick favor can you tell apple to turn the BLARING notification sounds off when phone is not on silent Its like deafeningly loud
iphonedos review is so much better
Im guessing its definitely a significant upgrade from my 8 plus  Anything is really
I like always on cause it allows me to see the time when I wake up without hitting buttons I just wish it would turn sideways with your phone to be like a clock
Give me free iPhone 14 pro bro
It takes FOREVER to get media off an iPhone I like lightening as a physical connector but I dont understand why it needs to stay limited to usb 2 Of all standards Its ridiculous
"Lol and here is space black my favorite color in years 
Like they havent had that color EVERY SINGLE YEAR"
Ill PASS this one I need PHYSICAL SIM
No you are wrong
That is nothing new Hauwai was the first to have it now Apple copied it from them now so it is nothing new at all Apple is just copying it
"ESim brings me back to the TDMA days back in my country 

Massive wait lines and bureaucracy whenever you changed your phone at had to get something done"
Your comment about the LG notch made it look like you wanted to bust Apple Please tell me you understand theres a difference in Being First and Making it Work For The Majority Its like trying to take MJs honor in introducing moonwalk to the world He put the technique in Show and Jazz combined with music and thats the art not necessarily being first
According to displaymate testing the iPhone 14 pros display can hit 2300 nits when outdoor and is the best smartphone display ever on the planet mkbhd
Always on display is not good enough because they still have i watch to sell  
Im from xr to 14 pro 
hes like not easy to copy dynamic spot be like hold my beer
when Marques holds the iPhone 14 Pro it looks like the iPhone mini but with the pro cameras especially at 1421
Where can I find the wallpaper Thank you 
LG has been doing all this before years back
Why No Sim Tray 
They could have made the always on display simple which could have benefited all the iphone with amoled display but they wanted to make it a new feature cuz iphone 14 pro doesnt have anything new So they made this which can only be applied to new iphone 14 Pro Display which can go to 1hrtz But sometimes using too much brain can make things worse
"The only cool new feature that I hope Android phones copy is the crash detection Dynamic island is just a cheap way of dealing with an ugly notch 

Oh and do all you Apple fans remember the lawsuits between Apple and Samsung Apple was trying to say that SamsungAndroid copied their slide to unlock and that they shouldnt use it Apple fans would say Android did copy them and Apple is right to go to court Now Apple hasnt stopped copying Android features like always on display widgets and many more Funny how everyone gives them a pass"
I want that wallpaper
Android been had this feature yall been under a dam rock
That ft is on Android all ready they been had that do not u know that u in iPhone world like Android been a head of iPhone yall tipping
Nobody mentions how these new features are things that are very invasive to personal privacy instead of actually being new futuristic tools outside our your body functions or exact location
Interacting with the dynamic island smudging selfie camera
Where i get this wallpaper
I remember the first video I watched of Marques had this songdisarm as the background intro It just feels so nostalgic listening and watching this intro Marques have been very loyal to this song Also the birds chirping sound when the focus shifts on the dynamic island is just too perfect What an amazing team to put in so much effort to provide quality content 
That Check me 24fps part 
You just keep touching and smudging your selfie camera 
Dynamic island name makes much more sense Its basically a technical term Maybe difficult to comprehend for a layman But hey layman always get excited with such buzz words Once they get the meaning youll hear it everywhere and its references
1558 yall see that red lantern fly STEP ON IT MARQUES
I would love it if the dynamic island had som sort of app history because sometimes when you listen to music and open another media with audio the music wont resume But it would be incredible if you could tap it to see latest used app and resume your music straight away
Last apple phone was the 5S so Im hoping going from that to the 14 pro max will be amazing but seriously the main reason is for that purple its Beautiful with a capital P Cheers
The best feature is the back glass being separate from the internals Finally
Put back manual sim slot
All these subtle changes Apple brings every year can be seen in older versions of Android The Dynamic Island is more of a marketing gimmick And these small improvements in CPU hardly matter to regular iPhone users unless they are into heavy gaming or cinematography
Loved the video Just fyi you said connecting AirPods twice at roughly the 1100 to 1115 mark
One question for apple what reason is there for me to upgrade from my iPhone 11
Slow down a little for the less technical guy
His watch tan line  1814
Is this iPhone Space Black in the video
Its clear what youre getting if youre someone that changes phone frequently otherwise if youre someone updating from a 3 plus year old phone this will feel like a major upgrade
The cameras make your eyes look like tony starks when wanda made him see a nightmare in the avengers
239 here comes Mr Beast
Ultimate Frisbee on a Dynamic Island would be cool
Ipone 14 seems not repairable anymore unfortunately due to software locking so ifxit will not help much
I dont even care if its not that useful I just think the always on display is kewl
"Its pretty funny seeing people saying dynamic island is something revolutionary It doesnt even look good in real life because in different lighting conditions you can tell which part is the cutout and which is the screen with turned off pixels

But anyway my question is does the screen still feel like cheap plastic in the hand The hollow screen was a shock to me coming from a Samsung Like the phone feels well built and then you have the screen that feels like those Chinese phones from 10 years ago"
Can you give me your old iphone 13 or iphone 12 pleaseI want an iphone so bad
Looks like you got in a accident  No worries your smart phone is calling a 1000 ambulance now
Wait so if the iphone 14 pro camera adds more exposure to darker skin toned people does that make iPhonesApple racist jk jk sorry
A Tesla surfboard
Id bet every cent I have that apple did testing and found that the majority of people that tested the dynamic island wanted andor expected a tap to open the app not open the widget Hence why a long press opens the widget and not vice versa
That phone is thicc idk bout all that in a phone in 2022 Can you imagine that thing in an Otterbox Be like carrying around a chemistry textbook
wallpaper link
Man I totally forgot I had an LG V10 before I switched to Apple 6 years ago great phone btw I used to changeupgrade Android phones every year now I upgrade every two years with Apple
"Marques and im saying this seriously

My guy you should work for Apple tbh

Tbat thats it think about it Marques on a Apple team

Wish you my best"
Excellent as it gets from you on these reviews as always Thanks MB
Face ID now works sideways  I havent seen anyone talking about that
"From my zflip 4 to this 
Its a great choicein term of resell value"
So the dynamic island is just edge lighting notification that does not go away
I have a gas app that tracks travels and stuff like that and I ride my motorcycle as main travel and whenever I break quicker just when Im ripping around having fun the harder breaking trips it as a collision and have had 69 accident triggers within a single 3045 minute ridenot really the best feature lmao 
Them school fight videos should be perfect now 
"I was going to buy the 14 but Eve Jobs put me off the idea
Thats funny I dont care who you are"
What is that first widget with the dots on the phone
That hoodie looks great but 65 bucks for a hoodie is just ridiculous
Bruhhhhhhhhhhh THE SCIKEST INTRO EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
So nice
Better than Apple intro 
I just ordered mine Im upgrading from the iPhone XR
At 643 what widget is that on the always on all the way to the left Is it calendar My calendar widget does not do that
Man i always love the honest opinion in the end whether we should upgrade it to or not nice way to end a fantastic review
Why on Bluetooth theres always scanning on the background This is really annoying and maybe a big reason for battery drain
Oh damn  I have watched the intro over 30 times in last week
"713 it will 2007 kanye GRADUATE to the front of the display 
love these little touches keep it up and amazing editing as usual"
MKBHD also talked about the iPhone 14s cameras for 33 of his video 
I owned a LG V10 and the dynamic island seems very similar to what that phone had  Look it up
Look forward for an iphone with horizontal leveling and 4k action mode stabilization This could be a game changer
Sakitech has an Android that copied the dynamic island
845 that background music though 
230 TechRax already tested it  dude does it work well 
Iphone 14 pro will be my iphone since the last iphone I used which was iphone 6 I am converting from samsung so should I go with Iphone 13 pro instead or what Keeping in mind I will use that phone for about the next 5 to 6 years throughout med school
whats that 1st widget on the thumbnail lockscreen
I think they copied the dynamic notch feature from the Uber app for drivers because i see that its practically the same one Uber drivers use
Chutiya banane ki machine
Marques love your reviews
Already is by a app called dynamic island the irony
"Yeas
The intro song brings back so much nostalgia 
So
So much"
Is it just me or do I prefer the Android always on display
Had iPhone since the beginning switch to Z Fold 3 in December first ever android my iPhone 14 Pro Max will arrive in 5 days I lasted 9 months on Android  it was HORRIBLE I will never make that mistake ever again
100 now I know why apple does not change the design frequently 
Awesome phone
I went from iPhone 7 Plus to iPhone 14 pro so all those features you gave a pass is big advance to me 
is the phone still good after the fall 307
This will be copied because Apple has also been a pioneer in copying android features that too when they are 23 years old  so the thing is everybody copies here
Is there any chance that i can buy an iPhone 14 Pro in the USA with it including the eSIM and the SIM Card I live in the Middle East
im just wondering if he ever went to his knee pt
Can someone please tell me what CoDM is like on 14 pro and 14PM Literally all i care about at this point
"The trailer for the iPhone was truly majestic in my eyes and the person describing it
was angelic Still not buying it until I get in a crash and siri decides to start talkin"
The AOD seems like its way too bright and uses too many of the pixels to warrant using it Hope they add some kind of customization menu so the background can be completely dark
The pill notch and no Type C Apple are you Deaf of what the customers want in a phone
Is it true that you dont need a case this time
POV Apple watching this rn
"Bought 13 this time
"
Oh my gosh Marques I hated the Dyamic Island until I watched this video Apple he is good
Thats a sick Intro
I have an iPhone X now and am planning to get an upgrade Any recommendations on what I should upgrade to
samsung MUST NOT copy that stupid dynamic island feature apple fan boys and fan girls are up in arms because the pill doesnt disappear when watching videos or movies HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAthis makes my oneplus 7 pro even more lovable lol
Ill buy my first iPhone in almost 10 years I had an iPhone 5S and my first Pro Max phone from iPhone ever when they finally switch to USBC That right there is the seller for me The iPhone will be a force to be wrecked with more than it already is once it does Cmon Apple hurry up
"It sounds like he is lowkey hating on the iPhone  
Ill stick with ijustines reviews"
What widget do you use  mkbhd
Im on a note 9 and Im thinking of switching to the 14 pro max or the s22 ultra or one of the fold phones I want something new and something I wont regret but im sticking with my note 9 until it dies so I got some time to think
I went from XS max to 11 pro max to 12 pro up to 12 pro max Having trouble deciding if I should go with 14 pro max or just 14 pro What would you recommend
i love having finger prints all over my front facing camera
Does uber use it
Do you know if apple is releasing a fifth color for the 14 pro and pro max 
730 most people about the dozens of minuscule changes Apple is making every year
We REALLY wanted the camera bump to get bigger
Wait those photos look quite average to me Is it just me
wow too good
"Iphone whats next for 2023
I seriously cant imagine"
bro just accused the phone of being racist lmao
anyone know the song at 527 
Im not sure what this Geekbenchmark is all about but Im thinking the people who actually understand it already know what to do to check that   Also I dont know what this means for me a regular consumer  
Anybody has the wallpaper on mkbhd video
Im not happy about the battery life on iPhone 14 pro I disabled always on display but still I think there is some bug in battery
Whats the calendar widget at 0206 on the left Thanks
can you please make a video about apple care and your opinion about the service
"Marques Brownlee I need to upgrade my phone Im using an iPhone XS and before that I was using a Sony Walkman phone lol it did what I needed it to make calls send msgs had music and was super durable as I drop my phone a lot and was going to get a 14 pro but then was told 6gb of ram is pitiful compared to Samsung but after briefly researching this it seems its not as simple as 6gb vs 14gb due to the way apps are programmed etc is this correct Also all the reviews I can find are 14 vs 14 pro I want to know 14 pro vs 14 pro max which would you recommend The max has longer battery but seems to be a mini tablet  my xs battery life is fine for I use it for plus I dont like the idea of not being able to use the phone 1 handed so would you recommend the 14 pro Are there any other difference besides size and battery life
Cheers 
Ps awesome reviews by the way even a dummy can follow what your saying for the most part haha"
I think that apple should limit the phones functionality when on screen lock like  not being able to shut down the phone without  face ID to prevent theft  Because it makes it super difficult to track Its when it off
great music taste bro keep it up
Anyone know whats the widget calendar looking one he have on the lock screen
Would be amazing to have a notification dot in between the pill instead of AOD
you know marques is cultured when you see him playing J COLE
1322  LG GUY I TOLDDD you
Dynamic island 
Now you gotta wipe the front camera everytime you take a selfie 
Not me watching my role model thoroughly explain everything about the iphone 14 pro so I can educate my friends about it 
Windows XP forever
A tech hoodie that isnt cringe Incredible work Marques
Anyone know where he got the wallpaper from Super cool
Great video
Can someone please tell me how he got the full calendar widget on his lock screen I feel like Ive tried everything but cant seem to figure it out
I purchased the 14 Pro Max 256 gb which was delivered on 916 I am extremely dissatisfied with the phone call clarity Each phone call I make there is so much static and the conversation is choppy I cannot hear the other person Then if I hang up and call a second time immediately the call clarity is fine This happens with outgoing calls And does not happen when I call from my iPhone 13 Pro Max or my iPhone 8 Plus Very disappointing after spending 1200 for this phone I think I have a couple of days left to return it
Apple sucks 
airpods pro 2 review 
I dont know why no one has talked about how you have to press on the literal camera and get it dirty and when you take a picture you are gonna have to clean the camera idk I feel like the dynamic island isnt really needed
him saying connecting airpods 2x bothered me so much lol
Can someone post a link to the wallpaper in the video Not the one in the thumbnail the second one that appears in the video i cant find it anywhere
Its iPhone 13 pro iPhone 14 pro are same
Hoodie
Going from a 2nd Gen iPhone SE to the 14 Pro Max Pray for me 
Hey Marques are there any updates as to when the Belkin iPhone mount will be available I really wanna get that mount ASAP so that I can use it as my MacBook Pros webcam once MacOS Venturas finally released plus Id also imagine that itd also make a great additional accessory for the new iPhone 14 lineup too
I do like the im not testen that great vid
First time I like a clothing piece from a content creator
"That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ the Father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him The eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe according to the working of his mighty power   Ephesians 11719
 Praise the Lord The LORD Jesus Christ is coming soon"
What is that dots widget on your lock screen
Great review And shoutout for the Hocus Pocus BGM
Honestly the iPhone 14 pro is a waste of  money Now before anyone says Im poor or hating I am typing from my 14 pro 1TB this phone is just an obvious stepping stone for Apple to test a bunch of new ideas to slowing acclimate their customers to a new generation of layouts The same layouts that IOS 16 gave older phones Unless you are using something truly older a step below an 11 pro like a XR or your battery is fried there is no reason to upgrade The camera is so far the best feature and we know your average user is not going to use it to its full potential the screen is nice but no one has ever complained about this YouTube video or Netflix movie just isnt clear enough watching on a phone
I have an iPhone 6s and looking to update to a new phone  Need help to choose between an iPhone 14 Pro Max or a Samsung S22 Ultra which is currently on sale I need a phone for good quality and a instant photo shooting without lag for emergency purpose such as if somebody crashed into your car and they speed off you want to just press the buttom to take a photo shot Is there such thing on a phone those days
Is anyone else thinking that the Dyanmic Islands design flaw is literally that the front camera is next to it Youre literally smudging the camera lol
1500 PRINCE DAEMON 
I love your videos but why are you so biased
Big props for mentioning that LG invented the dynamic island feature 7 years ago
When I watched this video on my iPhone 14 Pro the Dynamic Island just happened to cover part of the top of the screen
Maybe they are waiting for the EU laws to kick in for USBC in order to add 8K for transfer speeds
Hi Marques great comments even though I am an Android phone user what apple have brought on the iPhone 14 with injury app that will connect with emergency services using the person s  medical scenario say in my own case as I am a person who suffers from epilepsy and very prone to seizures obviously a medical doctor is number 1 or calling an ambulance but that app should be put on all phones where a person needs it cheers Apple for pushing the app forward best wishes from Ireland Declan 
This phone should be named IPhone 13 20
It still sux
Wallpaper plz
"dynamic island my ass this is just a pure excuse for apple to not innovate
we are in 2022 the iPhone 14 shouldve had an under display camera setup  the technology is already nearly 4 years old at this point and it works nearly PERFECTLY well
this dynamic island crap is going to stay with us for at least another 5 years
Apple  instead of being fucking lazy and not innovating and wasting money on shitty marketing  spend your money on RD for a FULL display tech with underdisplay FaceID
what is holding me back from getting an iphone again is bullshit like that Apple used to lead innovation in smartphones now apple only leads greed in smartphones"
isnt two of the cameras fake 
Late to the party but great great video I doubt that you will  be responding but I am not sure if you ended using the regular 14 Pro or the 14 Pro Max Also what was the reason for your choice Thx anyway 
1401 okay pickleback
Marques is the perfect YouTuber to watch while doing daily quests
The only reason Apple is still in business is because Nokia lumia didnt have apps
That dynamic Island seems like nothing more then a gimmick to me 
Tbh i know that they wanted to make its look different but it grabs even more screen estate from usability because that thin stripe above is pretty much useless for displaying anything and the software features could be easily adopted to notch alsowhich they ofc wont do
Thanks Dude 
If iPhones 1  13 did not make you happy iPhone 14 wont either  Cool a little black bar  Save your money and go outside
This notch is just ugly and unforgivable for a company with these Ressources
Im getting this in November
I dont understand why he is so triggered by the name youre the one making it weird by saying it in a weird way and always freaking out about it
 iNotch or Dynamic Island is a software innovation will be easy copied Even without Notch  This feature is a beautiful  and useful way to hide a notch with applications and notifications  What about using in Dark Mode
"Google Pixel introduced Car Crash Detection in 2019 
its not new liars"
PLS SUGGEST I need a good OS with great front camera for Social Media postings Im currently using OnePlus 7 Need an upgrade
"When you review cell phones can you please talk about main purpose of the phone 

For example  call quality ease of answering and disconnecting phone volume of speaker and non speaker phone  microphone quality  how well people can hear me when I talk 

It surprises me how hard it is to search this information"
The name of this release should have been iphone 131
Does anyone have a link to the wallpaper that Marques is using
"Question for you andor your readers  Does the 14 Pro allow you to label a timer  
Currently with the Apple watch 7 you can set a timer and easily add a name to that timer   Example hey Siri set a timer for 45 minutes to pick up the mail  The timer displays pick up the mail throughout the countdown and when it alerts you  Im using an 11 pro soon 14 pro and it does not let me label a custom timer
Thanks for your outstanding review of the 14 Pro"
Wait Hell waiiiiiiiiit Did he just like dropped it 
I thought AOD would be available within ios16 firmware
I bet Jerry rig will test the crash test love you marquees
Boy this guys reviews are good I can see why he gets these views Impressive
The dynamic island confuses me I dont see how it any better than how notifications show up on the top of normal phones
where do i get that wallpaper please
Still with the notch in 2022 And now is even bigger and more intrusive  Unbelievable
Im a Android user since ever but want to change to iphone Should I get iphone 14 pro now or should I wait for next year to get the iphone 15 pro The main reason for waiting is the USB C port
hey everyone i just wanna say to believe in Jesus for he loves u so much that he died for u so u can have a relationship with him Believe in him and ask GOD for forgiveness of your sins and form a relationship with GOD the father
Apple relases a new phone every year and makes the last phone feel like a piece of sht of you dpnt buy the new one
When he dropped the iPhone 14 pro me
my man here was right in less than a week dynamic island was copied
"guys this new camera is racist
cancel it yall"
Of course he has to talk shit about crash detection because hes upset android didnt think of it first
Anyone have a download of that wallpaper
Where can i get the wallpaper on the intro to the video
Nah there are plenty of things Android never copied and i rather oems just screw the notch entirely
Well not sure but touching the Dynamic Island which also include the front camera making the glass dirty may impact the Selfie and front camera picture in some wayi guess
The Dynamic Island is a Samsung feature I think
Sadly the iphone is still as boring as the last model
Love intro
iPhone is so boring Seriously nothing revolutionary here Just plain old marketing mumbo jumbo that doesnt really add value but just glorifies the fact iPhones are so late in the game and just keeps banging its own drum tirelessly  iPhone is made in California It is US made  it is the best   The lies kept told a million times and you believe your own hype The fact is the only reason iPhones are selling is because it is the last American brand thats being squeezed for whatever its worth by a country so desperate to be dominant Apple is Americas representation Its a brand being shoved to the worlds throats by a country intent on staying relevant Period
Thanks for the info vid flawless as always Im considering getting my 1st iPhone ever and this is my prime candidate as right now thanks
I prefer mostly iPhone 13 pro bcoz iPhone 14 pro is just the same as iphone 13 pro and iPhone 14s price is like jawdropping bruuhh
I just upgraded from my 12 Pro Max The Dynamic Island sold it for me Good on Apple for making the notch useful I picked up the new purple It looks a lot better in person and better than the lavender Im throwing a case on it anyways so its not a big deal what color I got The Crash Detection was another thing that sold me on this phone I hope Ill never have to use it but Im glad I have it since I dont have OnStar
nice video
I appreciate that Apple has done something useful with that fucking cut
I always think theres no way you could come out with a new and better intro and you always do and its insane
Where can i get the wallpaper from the thumbnail please
Like how he captures the pixel buds pro in the new apple phone
dynamic black hole
The one thing that made LG the silent GOAT of mobile production they were mature when it came to doing experimental features without making bold arrogant claims
ah thats why it feels familiar LG V10 owner here
"A note on the repairability  french environmental law makes it mandatory for all electronic devices to have a repairability index Its based on ease of disassembly availability and price of spare parts etc 
Iphones11 pro models were 4610 12 and 13 pro models were 610 and the 14 pro scored 710"
Will the always on display remain on when the phone is being charged Id like to use it as a night clock
Sir Marques Brownlee is the first smart black guy Ive seen
Another marginal improvement by apple Sticking to my 13 until my free upgrade
From where you got this wallpaper 
Watching this videos would never lend me a iPhone14 I cant even this priceBut I still watch this plenty of time bcoz Im a great of you brother
Damn  I should sell my 13 pro  Not even a year old
237 Hes talking about MrBeast LOL
"SIM card slots are removed for US only afaik
German models for example will still have one "
Concept was copied from Huawei honor v20 I 2018
Esim only also here in Europe at least in Latvia
make sure to have your knee PT and floss on time
The 48 mp camera tech and pixel binning sounds a lot like the Nokia 808  Lumia 1020 tech with its 41mp large sensor
I cant believe Apple kept saying the n word in the big and bigger commercial 
No one will copy this feature because its a gimmick and silly People will turn off these gimmicks after the novelty wears off I turn off all animations on my phone as its irritating
Dynamic Island is marketing speak for a gimmick Thats all that little pill shape cutout is Samsung had that on the the S10 and got rid of that pill shape cutout This island is exactly the same and shows fancy animations but thats it Nothing more than a gimmick After the novelty wears off youll turn it off and never use it again Frankly its cool at first but gets annoying
dont like this phone serious buyers remorse
As the dynamic island is terrible name to you if it were up to you what will you called it for marketing purpose 
I really hope companies dont copy and make apple the torch bearer in mobile industry Dont copy apple please Phone manufacturers should have their own identity and maybe that way they can get more customers and a greater brand value
"Wow bro iphone 14 
 How much did it cost  
2 
 Two whatt  

"
Nice Review WoW Good Job
"22 minutes  
Ugh "
1047 They should just give you the choice to do one or the other 
thats too long on accident detection bro
Is that how incoming calls are looks right now On top of the screen Can it be changed for the full screen picture of the person whos calling and with answer and decline buttons on bottom
"I have a query regarding iphone 14 propro Max
If i purchase iphone 14 series from USA in which they dont have sim tray and only supports esim than would it support Indian carrier network providers in India 
I have purchased iphone 14 pro from USA and it will be in India soon
So I just want to make sure that would Indian provider Jio and Airtel esim would work on pro series of USA models
It will really be appreciated if you solve my query"
When you dim your lock screen in the menu AOD will be on black background
What calendar widget is that on the lock screen
I have an iPhone SE 2020 should i upgrade 
That intro beat was savage bro 
"I think the Dynamic Island name might come more from like a kitchen island or an island in some other part of a house while viewed from above more than an actual islandnot sure in a lab or some other industrial setting that kind of surface would be called an island as well

But for me it makes more sense because you can put lots of useful things in a surface like thatthe analogy works better that way than with an actual island"
still missing thermal camera imo
My apple watch thinks Im washing my hands when Im using a ratchet
That 48mp sensor078i is bigger than S22 ultra main sensor 075i
Those intro graphics are insane 
its insane how massive the camera bumps are now IPhones use to be so smooth and sexy looking The past couple generations of camera bumps are just hideous
Where can i get that wallpaper its amazing
I have the iPhone 6s right now and just ordered the 14 pro will it be worth it
THE NOTCH WILL BE COPIED LOL
Always thought my LG V10 was way ahead of its time
Finally some credit for LG mobile from MKBHD 
The camera is racist  oh my damn
Isnt the back glass panel saparable just in 14s  Not pros or maxes
The car crash feature and emergency sos system is incredible I got the 13 pro max now and as a DoorDasher this is amazing feature too hear Upgrading next week to the 14 pro red or new color have 13 pro max for a year now really exited for this one
234 thats a bad feature what if you drop your phone and somehow disconnect the touch screen capabillities and then it calls the police
"Thats also pretty clutch
I will also not be testing that
Best line Ive ever heard from a tech reviewer "
And what game were you playing whats the app
"My company offer me for 250  the 14 pro or for 125 the 13  proWhat should I take
Its too complicated "
I need me one of them hoodiesthx for the great content and coverage on this bad boy from apple
or your iPhone 11 dies in a few hours has cracks on both sides and is just cheaper to get a new phone loving the iPhone 14 pro so far 
I dont think Samsungs will copy this they already have a more modern version thats less intrusiveout of reach For example if you set a timer and go home alittle widget pop up will have it counting down You can move this or just dismiss it
The classic song
"Surprise to get the video length upto 22 min 

So14 is a featured phone right"
does anyone know the name of that lockscreen widget with that braille looking thing on the left below the time
Im gonna go for this after 2 years with 11 So excitedd 
bro where did you get the wallpaper you used thnx in advanced bro for answering
The selfie camera is sometimes racist
Im watching the iPhone 14 pro review after preordering it and Im getting goosebumps after remembering your Galaxy S4 reviews I used to watch  used to dream of getting that 1080p phone back in 2013 Damn the years have gone by
ayo you listeng to kanye game to 10000000000000000000 point with me
Yeah ill wait till the 15 comes out
MKBHD underestimates youtubersI bet someone like Danny Duncan would make a video actually crashing into his own house on purpose just to see if the iphone calls Emergency servicesAND he would have them show up  THEN hed fix both and give them both to whoever showed up lmao
Im watching this with my IPhone 14 Pro Max 
This is the good video and very interesting
With 10 years of android phones  Im tempted to try Apple again first time since iPhone 1 Should i try the iPhone 14 pro max or wait for next year 15  Or will it be similar to the 14 pro max 
Im still on the gence of switching Ive always had an android and have upgrqded my Notes every couple years but Ive thought about switching to iPhone to see if it would help with being able to keep a phone more than 2 years and lagging issues
Hey Jidion how is it going 
Who is Andrew
I have the 13 mini I upgraded because the dynamic island the emergency gps and because honestly the battery on the mini is garbage
Would you recommend iphone 14pro or 13pro for someone who consumes mostly media like YouTube and movies Currently using OnePlus 7t and considering to upgrade to either Samsung s22 utlra or Iphone 13pro14pro
But androids can zoom in on the moon craters I want that lol
MKBHD shows why hes the king again by being the only interviewer to explain what dynamic island is and not just what it does
Did they make the black boarder around the screen thicker again like they did between the 12 and 13
Anyone know where to get that rubix cube from at the back Whats it called
Excellent work though Apple should hire you for your video shoots
In your opinion are you team apple or Samsung What about google 6 pro Im torn between all 3
Bro stop talking about 8K its literally useless and unnecessary watch a video next to a 4K tv and a 8K tv you wont be able to tell which is the 8K 
 The accident detection will go off lot if I had that phone I ride my 4 wheeler pretty hard in the mudand have had it on 2 wheels on its side etc Yeah its not good for us people who are rough in the outdoors
What is the wallpaper you were using in this video
Dynamic island is a pretty smart solution for the notch and allows ios a level of multitasking that is often taken for granted on Android It makes even less sense on MacBooks but thats where this is going If anyone remembers clippy or bonzybuddy they were interactive gui elements this is exactly that minus the annoyance
Youre forced to hold your phone like a mom using one hand to grab and one to navigate  plus the size is uncomfortable big  apple stoped impressing me after iphone 6
Another great review
Wait you mean to tell me that apple literally just turned a cellphone into a SATphone Say less
Though dynamic island looks cool I dont think its new because there was an app for Galaxy S10 which did these kind of stuff not refined like iphones obviously but it didnt has the fancy name
Connecting AirPods is so important my man said it twice
Its a iPhone 13S
What is the dotstyle widget you have on the lock screen
What do you all think Instead of Dynamic Island we go with DI I mean I personally like iBar but that is just me
Satellite connectivity is actually a really cool feature Namely for those who explore the outdoors campinghiking skiingbiking etc numerous times youre without service and IF something should happen a little more piece of mind is nice
Apple is on crack
Is it possible that every year when new iphones are released apple slightly degrades the quality of their existing pro model cameras via software updates so that the new pro cameras look premium and advanced
Can we just get USB C already
"Not having 8K video recording is a nonissue as 8K isnt even mainstream yet Even now 1080p is the standard resolution for monitors and TVs 

Also gonna have to disagree on the LG V10 comparison because this is a different implementation and integration between hardware and software"
That moment when youre next to an Iphone 14 Pro at WUCC but didnt know
"I bought an iPhone 14 pro max I am very happy with the phone However I would like to inform some mistakes with the iPhone 14 pro max

 In the WhatsApp app the proximity sensor does not work and does not turn off the screen when listening to audios
 The camera app not third party apps makes a small noise as if it were an open microphone That same noise but stronger does it when the mobile turns on when it is completely off after the apple logo appears that noise for a moment
As notifications do not vibrate in the Apple Watch
 The iPhone 14 Pro Max has a problem in the Camara app the native app makes a very small noise as if it were open microphone Also when we turn off the terminal and turn it on it makes the camera a fast noise
 In some apps The keyboard does not appear the words suggestions
 The new notifications are very good but there is a problem at the notification center many times we do not see if there is It would be good to inform through some point or brand that we have ancient notifications So without the need to move to see that there are old notifications in the panel And if we move to be able to see them
 Siri in Spanish has lost some functionalities For example he no longer answers questions such as how much is missing for the alarm to sound Ask him to put an alarm for tomorrow and if more than 0h have passed to ask us if we refer to tomorrow or today"
Uhh battery Did I miss it
1817  the dog be like  dude Leave me alone
Ah yes the 11th gen i5 is better than the 8th gen Whaaat in the name of marketing  
Did they finaly put usbc
Its Huaweis former subbrand who first introduced the dynamic island feature Honor View20 introduced it in 2018 
Theyre running out of tricks The ONLY thing I love about this phone is that its going to make buying an iphone 12 even cheaper
Gosh Marquees u been so far
So how do we travel overseas with an iphone in places that still intend to use physical sims as the main way to connect to their network
iPhone 14 same shit
you are the best at this
In Greece 14 Pro is 1230 and 14 is 1070 xd
I will also not be testing that 
I am returning mine Camera poor at autofocus giving blurred pictures Love the island but going to try Samsung for a change Maybe I will come back next year 
I mean why would you need your phone to tell you youve been in a car crash If your in a car crash you are going to know about it most pointless feature ever
My man Marques really put out a 20 minute editing  graphic design masterpiece and then chucked a couple TIMES NEW ROMAN lists in there
Dymanic island copied in less than 2 weeks LOL
The last couple of iPhones do have physical and e sim The problem is the next works in some countries have no idea what esim is It would be great to purchase the esim for what ever country you are traveling to My iPhone can use multiple esim
Techrax Already Did It Crash Test
Good battery life and Apple dont really go hand in hand unfortunately
This is rubbish really people should stop buying the apple phone as there is nothing amazing that you cant find on android phones Apple without Steve Jobs is like Huawei without Google period It seems that there is no vision the people that runs this are not doing something for us the consumer its just for for money I cant justify the price for this I used to like apple until the last update my battery drains quicker and Im switching to android Hope people realise this and they will stop buying the BEST device when in reality is not really
837 whats that widget hes using with all the dots Some calendar app
Wow thats the first thing I thought The LG V line omg Like LG did this years ago and I know bc I had the v1030 lol
thanks for sharing the details of the hack working perfectly fine with me
that camera bump is a bit too much really
It works Thank you for your help
Damn
You need to clear your inbox D
Watching this on my 14pro
Hey i ordered Iphone proMax 512gb  and that will be my first iphoneim moving from s21 ultra to apple nowany advice Will it be hard to get used to it
They compared it to the A13 because they want people to upgrade from their 11s
Not mentioned 60Hz display still is a bummer Playing the game I suppose
I will not be testing that great word
The phone is fire but dynamic island is the stupidest name they could have given it Call it like the iDot or something
Nobody came for the hoodie bro we dont care LoL
You know the bitten apple is a representation of the forbidden fruit from Genesis If you dont want to go to hell I suggest you stay away from apple products Is it surprising that the technology that brings bad morals whooremongering and crappy music without talent literally crap taking with fake beats promoting drug dealing and violence The mark of the beast is real and will NOT go unpunished
Man this guy is smart
Doubt anyone is gonna copy the notch againI mean detached notch Samsung is working on under screen cameras Apple will do this in about 15 years Apple is falling behind in every aspect New chip but same performance nothing noticeable in day to day People will still buy and we wonder why Apple gets away with selling a 1k stand
Topnotch quality video production Wow Just wow
What kind of car was that that you were driving with the U shaped steering wheel
So youre not gonna talk about watching youtube with it The dynamic island will be very visible at the screen when watching youtubeAlso notifications will come out at the top of the screen the same as the old iphone Wich is kinda annoying because we thought notifications will come out the the dynamic island
Apple literally copied Googles themed icons but okay bro
just remember u iphone ppl who think myiphone 13 is old i need tthenew iphone 14 remember 2 put somet new it that phone somet els has 2 come outthe phones are that thin they can not put anything els inand every phone is build for there purpos onlymeaning thr battry iphone was the 1st 1 to make sure u can not change the battry os when ya batry isidamaged u have tk swnd it 2 iphone its like selling you a car so iff uou get a flat tire you have to send it off to honda its just discusting and experts have said the way they keep that battry and how they put it in the phone its like they make theme bulletproof so no matter what u do u have to pay a fortune to getbit fixedive nevee had a iphine o r a fecent ohkje wheee no matter what there just after your moneyget yaself aanice phone and it will keep for 6 to 7 years no problemor buy a chinese 1 there diff makes but half the price and some say there better than iphone remembee aen aacompany makes rhat much they stop worrying about us cos no matter what they do we still buy them  so they stop caring every busnes dus it iff it becomes a multi million or billion pound companyanyhow most of all enjoy your life be kind and but most of all look after u and your familyu only get 1
Not impressed at all Looks the same as my iPhone 12 Once they actually make improvements ill spend my money on the new one For now my 12 is great
Simple clean smooth and ready to go out the box Dont need it to fold in half Ill take one please
I have an iPhone 7 should I upgrade or wait
the dynamic island is giving me the MACBOOK PRO TOUCH BAR vibes it was a great idea at first until people just didnt use it it was fun at first and then you forgot about it this reminds me of that  LOL
Apple just copy and paste lol but we buy it anyways because we have no choice
"That dynamic island is basically just an Android update and then you can enjoy it already
What I only impressed in Iphones is optimization and video and nothing else
Im using Google Pixel 4 and its still doing good and useful In real life you actually dont need pretty expensive phones if youre practical Also it has no notches or any distraction on the screen so media consumption is just perfect Just the forehead but no big deal
So yeah just my personal point"
Introducing the DI  Dynamic Island
1850 what You got it backwards Unless youre trying to trigger filmmakers Lol The 13 pro has 30fps Which is not exactly cinematic The iPhone 14 pro now supports 24fps which IS cinematic They should implement 24fps into the iPhone 13 pro too
Going to chill with my XS for another year Awaiting a giant leap in tech Pay check with Ben Affleck That plus USB C fast charging and shareable remaining power
Its always hoodie season
1327 
"Such a simple idea to make the notch a functional item while allow IR 3D to work as face ID

Why no other companies root for more intergrated solutions  when everyone else tried to hide it"
The hoodie is horrendous you should bin it
Do you think its worth it to upgrade to the 14 Pro Max from an S21 Ultra
"LG INOVATION REPRESENT 
RIP LG you did make phones"
Regarding the always on display Apple is funny in that they will take a feature that other phones have used for a while will Applefy it and market it as brand new never done before or never done before like this It makes people roll their eyes but oh well thats Apple
Anybody else wondering if MKBHD did floss 1030  TickTick Widget
Apple is giving people something they never ask for and I am sure most do not want That Island is an eye sore Most people want their full screen Samsung did it right with the punch hole and the indisplay finger print reader Apple is doing too much A lot of people break their screens so this is really going to be horrible for those people The phone iPhone today are too thick heavy and dont feel good to use as a phone I switched to Samsung in 2020 No looking back Apple will stay with this horrible design another 4 years It will be almost 10 years of the notch before they move on Samsung is moving into the future and Apple is stuck in the past using an old phone design from the iPhone 4 Tech that most people will gladly sacrifice for more screen I dont get what Apple is doing
the way you just dropped it
I just upgraded to the 14 Pro Max from the XS Max I definitely think Im in a valid margin of reason on upgrading haha
Never skip knee PT
My brother tried to convince me to get an IPhone  Im like nah
At this point do people really care about the camera Just get a damn professional camera
i love it but wiping the front camera is gonna become more consistent 
The apple way is not making the always on display a software update for other models
Does constantly pressing the dynamic island add a bunch of fingerprints to the front camera
Based on tech notes out there they believed that Apple was going to incorporate a WiFi 6E version With previous versions the data rates were less than half of the 6E Because of how it operates theres a better chance to download data successfully With the somewhat faster A16 chip 1 TB storage and what I thought would be the 6E WiFi which is what Samsung ultra models currently have I was ready to upgrade After learning it wasnt in there everything went full stop Ive got the same 6ax WiFi in my iPhone 11 so I guess Ill have to either get a Samsung or hope the 15 has it included
which phones would you suggest for nightimelowlightsky photosvideos if Apple doesnt make the cut
I had an LG V10 and absolutely loved that phone and the second screen  It didnt do a whole lot in retrospect but it felt nice to have
Honestly not worth the upgrade compared to the 13 Pro Unless you really want to take photos with your phone instead of a dedicated dslr or you really like the idea that Apple turned the notch into a permanent marketing point of the phone Just seems like the 13 Pro has 95 of the phone for cheaper now
"PLS ANSWER

Hey there  I am currently using an iPhone 11
Im here to know if its worth upagrading to 14 pro  not max 
Or should I go with 13 instead 
I also need a good earphones 
Im considering Beats Studio bus

So I need a clarity 

I wont be needing 48mp 
But always on and dynamic island are the additional features Im thinking about 

So 
Should I wait for 15 and 16

Ill be using any phone purchased now  for 3 more years atleast

So 
IPHONE 13 or 14pro

And yeah keep the budget in mind

So should I wait or buy 14 pro
I think the DI is just an experiment 

So what does MKBHD think

And yeah Im thinking about 13 green and beats 

Or iphone 14 pro

and I need to know to get beats studio or AirPods pro 
So the cost will be an iPhone 14 pro
Or 13 plus a nice pair of earbuds like AirPods pro maybe gen1
I hope the team answers 




And if possible make a Video about last years iPhones and this years 


I hope the team answers 

Love the team and MKBHD


CATCH U GUYS IN THE NXT ONE 
PEACE  

LOVE U GUYS FOR UR WORK

TQ"
wish apple focused on the hardwaresoftware more rather than the stupid camera
I got an XR right now Ive had it for a few years and the battery on it is so bad plus I wanna take some better photos would you say the 14 is better than the 13 and I should get that or is it not worth getting 14 and just get 13
How idiotic is it to have to reach all the way to the top of a 68 inch screen to open an app or answer a call with this bs dynamic island Seriously most phones make everything accessible down low because screens are so big and apple thought it was a good idea to have to use 2 hands to answer calls or open an app
"I appreciate the niceness of the battery life
You really put in the time my guy 
"
I saw you on Hot Ones  
new iPhone
Please also give a full review for the 14 pro max
Every year I watch those iphone reviews And this year the biggest change is Marques looks 1 year older more obviously
Can you make a 45 min video on iPhone 14 pro It would be awesome
Another year so little innovation Apple will never understand that gimmicks are not the same thing as practical hardware and software that make people wanna use their devices more
Is this feature technically invented by LG seven years ago with the top screen on the LGV10 Yes absolutely
Marques I love that wallpaper is that comes with iPhone 14 pro or is there a way I can get it for iPhone 13 pro max
I really like the iphone pro i like to get with gift
The Dynamic Island should be named TruDynamic Camera System
"The Always On Display feature has been around for like 5 years 
Apple  Always On Display JUST GOT REAL "
Im still rocking the iphone x lol
Iphone still has notch 
1402 so to nickelback
best 
Its more difficult to repair now Even if you swap parts from a genuine iphone to yours for repair it wont accept and you cant use it until apple does it by themselves And back galss is too hard to replace
Can you turn off the always on display Anyone know please
I just realised I havent subscribed yet But I always search for MKBHD for phone reviews Subscribing now
Dynamic island is called notification bar in android
Iphone 14 pro max is just a copycat of Nothing Phone 1
9 bulan full gak pake iPhone karna hp utamanya Google Pixel 5 pixel enak Android asli enak memang ada kalanya ngerasa kangen dengan ekosistem nya Apple terutama iPhone mungkin paling idealnya memiliki 2 OS Android dengan Pixel dan iOS dengan iPhone bagiku budget skrng ada buat beli iPhone 11 Pro second tpi dengan adanya ini nih si iPhone 14 Pro napa jadi berenti dan berfikir buat nabung lagi
1023 Andrew be pulling up out of nowhere
1322 BOOOM
can some one share the wallpaper link
Idk if i like that Dynamic Island but i can say that is fluid af and looks awesome
AFAIK its still a 12mp sensor but they use Pixel binding or smth to make it 48mp Correct me if Im wrong please 
MKBHD
Well done apple youve finally learned how to be original well for only the dynamic island Oh wait you just copied LG
Most MKBHD reviews are unbiased except when it comes to Apple reviews Guess money can buy anything
Apple offers dual sim card phones in China guess their business could be highly adaptable 
Everyones selfie game is going to suck LoL everyone is going to have a dirty camera lens from touching the island lol
Looks absolutely awful how did they make the notch even worse 
I still dont get why iphone doesnt have usbc
So new phone slightly barley anything new that we will use  or if we use them  we are already fu  lol like the sos stuff  not knocking the review Appreciate it Apple is just dead 
Does anyone know what app hes using that puts the calendar in dots on the screen
"As far as I understand you had a sample of product before availability in stores So you knew there will be issues around dynamic island under sunlight and didnt tell it Why Not good
Its not about hate for Apple products but about mentioning all pros and cons to make right decision and choice
Please uncover all the good and the bad things next time"
Fun fact Apple copied the Android notification bar just changing animations and position
Nice 
I turn u off in 10 second
hey guys another teenager here Im currently contemplating between the fold 4 and the 14pro max dont know whivh yo buy since Im upgrading have been using Android for a long time currently using the note 20 ultra I love my phone but I really dont like the Samsung s lineup even tho the s22 ultra is a note ripoff any suggestions or critique would be appreciated also I have the Samsung watch 4 classic aswell I believe in eco system support so lmk
One thing I was hoping Marques was gonna talk about is the fact that the dynamic island cuts into photos and videos that youre watching Which is its biggest drawback
The selfie camera I HATE it does this software fixing to my photos after the photo is taken  I like how it looks right when I take it and once I click on the actual photo its completely different
So a galaxy S10 with the cutout in the middle instead of the corner with some nice animations to go with
"I switched from Apple with the Pixel 2 and been with the pixel range since between first iPhone and the Pixel 2 Ive had multiple Samsung Galaxies in the mix too and I sort of really want to go back to the iPhone purely for the more polished look and feel but theres 3 things holding me back

1 No USB C charging Ive switched all my tech to only USB C charging now
2 Notifications reach the level of Android iOS 16 lockscreen helps but not completely
3 True default apps across the OS including voice assistants Love my google assistant"
LG 
13 pro case doesnt fit in the 14 pro
Iphone 6 as my first iphone in 2015 Shifted to 12 pro i 2021 Will shift again in 2027 when iphone 18 comes out Or whatever name will it be Hehehe
Great
Where is the back camera shaking and rattling
Nice dirty selfie cam after using dynamic island D
LoL using Samsung phone for Waze and Tesla for charging navigation D Fact that lack of Apple car play in Teslas makes OS useless
I have an iPhone 13 Is it worth upgrading to the 14 Pro
honest review
For sure Some random brand starts with S from Korea will roast it then shortly soon would copy LMAO
Idk if its just me or the rocks Im smokin but the notch and the dynamic island kindaaa looks the same as a notch
Im literally eating that Blue Apron ramen rn
I wanted this 1 but apple only try to give my trade in value on a 13 pro max not even 3 months old only 700 trade in  I think Ill wait
The production quality is just elite man 
"Mkb is highly biased towards Apple products He does not grill Apple for their monotony enough Had this been Samsung who released the same looking phone for 4 years now with minor software tweaks theyd be grilled to death by him rn
Please criticise Apple as neutrally as you criticise Samsung
Peace"
I still use iphone 7 plus bro trust me every little detail counts for me
I dont get why the dynamic island is hardware locked You could add the software to the old notch and save money on tooling and not encroach on regular screen space
Dynamic continent is out of reach on the top of screen I dont know why this guy is so fascinated
Wheres the wallpaper used in intro 
I returned mines because I hate the notch its so bloody pointless and ugly Major regret upgrading from my XS to the 14 Pro Ive waited years for a good upgrade but what a mistake Apple is no longer innovative
5G is that ATT lying again
What is that calendar widget hes using is that a 3rd party or iphone 14 exclusive
"I tried Dynamic island in a store today what utter crap
The ultimate letdown is there is no Low power modeLLM on IOS 16 on 13 Pro Max  WHY I have 120hz would love a  1hz never lock lockscreen"
This intro is sick
Those photos looked so realistic very good images
MKBHD video quality 
"You did an excellent video

Thank you"
So you drive an altima aye
Marques Your Dog Looked Thrilled in that Picture 
"1100 Marques must really like that this feature shows that it connects Air Pods  Lol he said that twice within 8 seconds
Also at 1502 that is one heckin good boy"
Samsung S22 better than IPhone 14 Pro Max It wont take long for Samsung to catch Apples market When the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is released next year Apples sales will be cut in half Please wait Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is coming to destroy Apples market
Jidion
lol 30fps cinematic best joke of the day
What wallpaper is that
Hey guys I dont know much about phones but isnt the dynamic island just a taskbar with funny animations
Soon as the iPhone gets usb c hopefully iPhone 15 Ill upgrade from my 12 lol
Is anybody having trouble with System data storage on their new phone Ive never seen this but mine is full 100G of system data I upgraded from 13 pro did an iCloud back The 13 pro never did this Rebooting the phone only solves the problem for about an hour then it creeps back up to 100G eating all my storage Has anybody dealt with this
i have an unboxing of my white 13 pro max on my channel i plan on upgrading to next years iPhone i def want the black one
VERY NICE
Things this iPhone has others dont  Less screen real estate over what is basically a gimmick dynamic island and a subscription useless satellite ping for more money Things it doesnt Headphone jack SD card slot Dual Sim  outside the US and Hong Kong repairability a charger in box and USBC I know that the cult of Apple is strong and especially in the US virtually unbeatable but not mentioning any of these  pitfalls on a phone that costs over 1K  oof Were bordering on snake oil salesman levels of advertising Other than that some of the best production quality in these reviews and really smooth presentation
SIM cards and Micro SD cards are pretty close in size  I really wish they would have kept the tray and switched to Micro SD card
The only thing the pill lets you know is iPhone arent going to have a edge to edge screen with the camera underneath the display anytime soon The iPhone 15 will just have a updated version of this Its a step back most people are too dumb to see
I honestly think the always on display is a waste of battery life
"Alright Im getting tire of people complaining about how bright the always on display is 

If you go into customize you can change the intensity of the brightness of the color in text Use the slider below the colors to change the intensity You can even choose a gray which looks like a dimmed out white Come on yall get with the program"
What if I have an iPhone 7 Plus  What should I do then 
Not all the 14s have the separate back glass only the base model my friend
Life360 app  free  Got into accident it detected crash  It contacted all my contacts
"Easter eggs

1 A globe with a pin in the middle of nowhere alluding to the Emergency SOS via satellite feature in the new iPhone 14 Pro
2 The Mojave dessert on the display indicating the again offthegrid option you can activate with this iPhone

Those are the easter eggs Ive spotted I could have missed more Maybe that donut shape figure next to the display"
You dont have to zoom in and out all the time Its actually overused and distracting
Im going from 8 plus to the 14 pro plus I keep getting told that I should see a huge difference between them Ive loved my 8 plus for so long well see
Surprised you didnt mention repairability
Any recommendation the what iphone a person should get if its looking for an upgrade from the iphone SE 1st gen Maybe not worth buying the 14
Okay The Always On Display breaks all my deals Too ridiculous
Its not hoodie weather quite yet Marques but it will possibly become that way in about a month You do lay out the specs well though and do a good job as usual   Ryan 1
Always on display is Never off display
One good featureand take rest for next 5 years
they should add that feature to the notch and call it dynamic coast
"After 12 years of Android its time to make the change
reason OS and security features
Great review"
I dont like the always on display
Dude I can see why you have this many subscribers I just subscribed This was a great informative detailed video You did your homework Nice Thank you
Its amazing how samsung makes majority of iphone parts to this date  Lol
What are the widgets being used at the 141 mark
Is it possible to turn that always on thing off
Feature wasnt created with the V10 Pretty sure the Samsung Continuum or whatever did it first
top video i have the 11pro max Think im going to hold out for another year or two before a major upgrade
Whats the red blob in the thumbnail
Should I change from a pixel 6 pro
Oh my God spotted lantern flies are all around us
Its funny how iphone can be so damn uncreative with the design amd offer no changes and be praised and samsung gets crucified for not changing the design enough
Still cant understand that so many people say that the iphone has such a good camera After oneplus 5t 7t pro samsung s9 and now oppo find x5 pro i always been comparing with the respectable iphone model compared to the phone i had from around the same year they came out Everybody else in the family has iphone but after comparsing in lightroom the iphone photos did not perform better than the samsung s9 1 7t pro and the iphone 13 doesnt beat the oppo find x5 pro And dont forget that from the moment iphone got the optical image stabilization they are breaking more then the android phones
Where is the link to the wallpaper 
Apple just tries to deliver best out of the already existing technology No innovation  Dynamic island
"Takes my phone on a roller coaster

Siri hey 911 theres been a terrible car accident on the SpiderMan ride"
I still prefer android always on display
549 where can i find the wallpaper is it from ios16 iphone 14 or something else
The always on display would definitely annoy me Would there be a way to turn it off
"Hi MB
Really love your works always my pref even if not always agree but thats ok
Im just having a question since long time Yes thats apple related stuff
Ive used Android til 19 for 10 yearsThen bought my first iphone 11 pro max Still with me w ios16
TLDR  love iphone my watch  my airpodsbut I have really a bee inside my brain when Im watching new reviews of new iphones 
1 Why  do you not you but all you reviewers dont ever say that iOS dialer app is st Its an important app that in 2022 is a kid toy compared to androids one No search no web search no spam filters Nothing That is quite hurting since phones that have this OS costs more than 1k in italy even base 14 is 1000 euros
2 Why  do you not you but all you reviewers dont ever say that iOS is still a MONOTASK system Why dont say some little annoying words to Apple I know its going to change anything but if reviews focus also on this wellpillsdynamic islands superpower chips 2k nits ramsbut still need to keep open Instagram to load a story 
Peace"
Hoodie season is every season 
"LG V10 deep cut

Shoutout to everyone that had a V10 that bootlooped then got a warranty replacementthat also bootlooped "
In Europe the standard 14 starts at 1000 and the pro max at 1500
No sim card slot is a HUGE problem for travelersbackpackers who go to the more remote places where all you can find is the cheap simcards damn
306 what casing is that
Not as much as apple has copied from Android brands 
I was disappointed there was no new iteration of TouchID  There were rumours of it being built into the screen  I would have been happy with something like the iPad TouchID button on the side
Anyone who knows the background used in the phone
So dynamic island is a basically a huge notch that gets biggerlovely
How many moved to LGV10 straight away and concerned about those finger prints on the selfie camera due to Dynamic Islandand that cuteness from his feral champ
"Mate  want to make it a thing Click one set of pics with identical setting and see how different models fare over time Would be a good callback for all your videos too 
Love from India"
I cant take my eyes of that hoodie its 
im still sailing with my iphone 10 lol
What widget are you using on your lock screen for the calendar  Appreciate the minimalist look
would you recommend to upgrade from iphone 13 pro to 14 pro
You didnt mention the satellite antenna
1143 Nice
What are the dots on your lock screen widget May I know the app
"I dont know how i feel about always on display
I always lock my phone to quickly see if I look ugly or not"
I travelled throughout Europe when roaming was still chargeable and never once did I want to use a foreign sim in my phone Id rather buy a burner phone for 20 and use it for a limited time I really dont understand people who complain about the lack of physical sim slot this must be the most niche use case ever
Does anyone know this So I have a Samsung is there a way I can transfer some stuff to Apple If so please explain how thank you
i think i am in love this phone is so out of this world
1323 LG should rebrand itself as OG
What bugs me is that these animations would be easily implemented in the old iPhones up to the X as well A bit poor that apple has to do this to make the phone feel somewhat new this year
The island shit is so hideous   Im gonna go with the iPhone 13maxpro
"Hi
question I have the iPhone XR now and I need to upgrade and I dont know what to get All I really do is talk text FaceTime watch youtube and take a lot of photos of my son  I do us my phone some times for a reference photos to draw I was looking a the 14 but after watching your video I was thinking of going with 13pro  But the 14 pro is dope   what do you recommend for someone that is basic"
had to flex the red cards
On September 19 2014 8 years ago Apple released the Apple 6 Plus  Configured for 128GB of storage at only 949  Walking out of my local Apple Store I noticed the receipt was over 1000 with sales tax  For 8 years now I keep hearing oh look a 1000 phone  Value budget worth it etc  Debate amongst yourselves  but there has been a 1000 iPhone for 8 years
I still have the LG V10 the second display was crap though
The Dynamic Island is literally a glorified notification bar
"nah i would still take a phone with traditional bezel over the ugly notches or whatevers including this new dynamic island thing
it doesnt need to be something like what iphone 7 or othe older home button iPhones had just take something like Sony Xperia 1 line of phones
those have small barely noticeable bezels on top and bottom the display
they are so small that the experience is pretty darn close to what screen without a bezels would have but without any stupid cutouts or notches getting in the way of things"
As an avid mountaineer the satellite communication is groundbreaking Maybe for some that feature seems like something you would never use but I spend almost every weekend out of cell service The ability to keep family updated with my location quickly and easily and have the ability to call for rescue is an absolute insane feature for me 
I miss when blackberry was superior  any of you remember the Samsung Blackjack
Hot take I DONT think this will be copied Maybe some janky Chinese oem might do something but this is so far behind where everyone else is at I just dont see anyone else giving a crap I think youre wrong We shall see You dont even seem to be aware that Pixels and many others have had crash detection already So
Anyone know how to get that calendar dotted Lock Screen widget he has
Said connecting air pods twice at 1116 
1106 1114
"Yo i have a question 
I just got a 14 pro max and the display isnt nearly as bright as my 12 pro max when both all the way turned up"
The only design change for apple is the price
Wow It works The first time i tried it took
lol
I am still gonna skip 14 although Im using 8plus  still waiting for finger print sensor on iPhone  
aah crap  did you just dropeed a iphone 14 bro  D Lamo
iPhones camera look needs a redesign It doesnt belong to the phone
wow so many clickbait youtubers out their but u hold it down
Should i upgrade to the 14 pro i have a xs max
Ahh the LG v10 one of the best phones I ever owned and wish I could have it but updated for 5g and all the current tech
I hate that they took away the physical SIM card slot
Not here for Apple but for Marques incredible production quality
I prefer clean beautiful display without a notch Most newer phones are moving away from the notch already I think the notch is distracting Now the dynamic notch is even a more distraction to the display This feature might be useful and  copied but it can be done without using the notch Such as on the side like Samsung navigation bar and it can be hidden or disabled This is like put a lot of makeup over the notch Seems like people are more excited about new features than the beauty of the display
oh no the bug at 1553 is a spotted lanternfly they are invasive and a huge problem in eastern pa sad to see they are spreading 
I have iphone 6s and planning to get iphone 14 pro thats gotta be a huge upgrade  Excited
liking the beard thing
Umm cinematic mode was already 30fps in the iPhone 13 pro its the 14 pro where they just added 24fps
Hey Where did you get that wallpaper from
A study was just done last week by Tempe University that showed evidence the new processor 64bit ARMv85A is causing headaches in their test users They dont know why this is happening but they believe its because the processor itself is using certain ELF frequencies thats potentially dangerous to human users
Was the song in the opening credits some funky version of I cant make you love me by Bonnie Raitt
The iPhone tried to copy Samsung with the always on Display but they dont have any settings for the brightness on the always on display on the iPhone but the android do
If they had a type c port I would had switched I guess I have to wait and see if the Iphone 15 has it or not
That Kanye and Cole album though 
1117 You said connect airpods twice there lmao
Name of the rap songs in the vid
Dynamic Island is a Cheap copy of Androids PIP view
"Yup The Apple Way
Correction Features are copied The Apple Way"
which calendar lockscreen widget is he using i am trying to find and no luck
Anyone know how to get the Lock Screen widget with the dots
What is first widget on Lock Screen One with dots Im guessing
Its already copied 
On the thumbnail which app is the widget on the left side for
But does it work wit Amazon music tho
This was amazing Thank you
LG was one of the most innovative cellphone maker it is sad they dont make phones anymore
Do you think 15 pro will have a new design
Every company has been copying Apple since day one From the simple charging port to hardware designs and software to even remove the headphone jack that every company hypocritically made fun and ads about just to do the same later Its crazy that Apple is just one company competing against so many others yet they do what Apple does
The iphone is like the telsa yeah it has some different stuff but nothing has changed sorry I wont be getting one of those for a green bubble
wait will the esim make it harder to transfer data from my current phone to the 14
1804 
Interesting but expensiveBut do you know with the money you make from trading you could afford it 10X Ask me how
There are no satellites  Only communication towers for phone service  We have and are still being lied to about space travel which is nothing  but a fantasy
seriously considering an upgrade currently have the 10s max and wanted the blue 13pro but now the new purple 14pro is tempting me so idk now lol
do you anyone think apple will come with a new color just as it did for iphone 1313 pro I would prefer to have again a version of green for iphone 14 
Nice camera and can make a phone callunbelievable
Never been a fan of apple I just switched to an iPhone about a year ago after airtag was out Got my self smartwallet to put it in The amount of times it saved me from shouting  Where is my wallet One of the best invention out there
How does DI work with Reachability
552 i love how this new edition of the iPhone allows use of multiple background applications such as Wordle and WordleBot
I have a samsung galaxy s8 edge from 2017 I really need an upgrade but i think of going to iphone 13 pro Is it a bad decision now or is it better to go with the iphone 14 pro instead since both are quite expensive Thanks in advance for any tips
on the pixel 6 pro car accident detection would always trigger when slowing to a red light and the device falling from the dash mount at the same time So detection might just be using gps and gyro to detect crashes at least on the pixel devices
The notch is still ugly But Apple fanboys celebrate everything Apple brings new
So the annoying notch is now more annoying Yay Android see you back very soon
So Apple copying LG now 
Marques Brownlee If you wanted to start making Youtube videos and maybe stream would this be good enough Or would you choose something else Ive a Apple 11 now but videos look so jerky if I try and record anything
The dynamic island is cool but unless you have giant hands like Marcus you cannot use the phone with one hand
wonder if the dynamic island is gonna be a flop like touch bar on the mac
Apple running out of things to change 
I hope it never gets copied as someone who already dont like the normal notch this is like someone stabbed my screen
No my watch pop up to even when I walk a long distance it ask if Im doing a walk work out
I was surprised that Apple went with Always On Display instead of Constant Luminous Projection
In honor of 30fps cinematic I too will not be using it tho P shooting all FKJ footage this Nov in 30 instead of 24
Wallpaper anyone 
No sim card tray is going to be bad for people who travel
Have a samsung note9 should I get the s22 ultra or 14 pro
I like how the new iPhone 14 watch and earbuds are finally getting features that android users have had for years Still no powersharing tho
Does the 14 pro max have a sim tray That sucks
The intros could be a commercial itself 
Love the LG mention Its a shame that they were so slow with updates because their hardware was always great and innovative Thinking that they might not release a new phone ever again Im actually planning to buy some of them just for collector purposes
I wonder if when you record a video if you can slow the frames per second to match something like LED flickering or helicopter blades spinning
I dont hate the Dynamic Island However I think Samsungs OneUI approach that tries to put as many controls as possible under your thumb makes more sense I dont like having to use both hands or do an awkward gesture across the whole display just to switch something
That onyx like color is just beautiful
Anyone know where he got his wallpaper from
YES He said it LG V10
The iPhone 14 Pro is great but its being slowly overshadowed by an apparent avalanche of iOS 16 bugs camera noises activation issues for FaceTime and iMessage and eSIM problems Wouldnt be shocked if we get a rather rapid iOS 16 update this week Mkbhd wont mention these though everything apple is perfect in his world
Butdoes it overheat
I definitely dont like that crash test shit I do a lot of judo my phone my pocket because I forget I have to fuck with my phone after getting slammed
Wallpaper link bro pls
"453 Why Why fking not
Christian Bale"
"When you said at the start that it looks exactly the same as the iphone 13 pro
I was confused that was that a insult or what"
Infact apple copies mostly from Android Even this thing is copied from Android except they named it dynamic island
They could have done a dynamic notch for the nonpro never mind I just remembered its apple
Real man would test the crash detection in a Rivian
For anyone curious about the battery life costs of using AlwaysOn Display 07 extra per hour and it disables in your pocket upside down and during Sleep hours
Are these default wallpapers Is there a link to them Tks  
I dont have money to buy iphone 14 pro max so I fill my heart by watching marques brownlees video
I heard iPhone 14 pro runs a blockchain enabled operating system so as to better enable crypto transactions
Do you know what guys Marques his video you can watch anywherein office kitchen dinning while your eating and good enough even toilet this guy his video is always on the top bro your amazing nice work
WHAT AN INTRO
I got a 13pro in may I like the dynamic island on this one I may upgrade in a few months from now
The difference between the 13 Pro and 14 Pro is like that of the iPhone 4 to 4s Its not remotely worth the upgrade lol
Man turn off monetization I cant watch video in ads
Hi Marques You know what Id like A really ultra saving mode like Android so we can deal with longer battery life in situations where we cant get to charge our phones
Bro iPhone is boring 
Apple copyed that
I was going to upgrade to the 14 but I was told I cannot upgrade with my carrier until Feb So I guess I will wait for the 15 and hope they finally add USBC
what is your current daily driver
the Dynamic Island is kinda cool but the finger prints on selfie camera just killing me 
Get it only if you have a 11 pro
Why wont u be testing sattelite sms
I had an iPhone XR for like 3 years honestly
iPhone 14 has 4 models So which model to BUY I decided NOT to buy any Too confusing and too expensive too
nice intro song I love Alltta
Lg V20 had it on 2016
What is that widget you have on the homescreen that looks like braille but like a calendar in some way marking days with events mkbhd
I just want a foldable iphone at this point the new samsung z flip looks so cool but Im in deep with apples eco system
"I loved the v10 with that double screen which led me survive an entire year in college without a laptop The main screen was enormous and as lgs QSlide apps feature can draw applets over other apps like a window it made the phone very dependable for serious work especially things like calculator It was my only device during my first year at college  all assignments done all video editing made reports PPTs designs with just that phone as I didnt have a laptop It was a bummer when they discontinued it after v20 I now have an iPhone 13 but its nowhere near how v10 used to be in fluid multitasking on a mobile device The second screen used to intelligently show the most important apps functions I needed to switch more like a companion and if needed there was always QSlide apps to do some quick jotting or calculation without getting out of the current screen It was like a live companion which was actually useful I used to wonder why it disappeared when the phones became all screen

Also worth mentioning was the desktop class files app it had which was miles ahead of the crappy files app I have on my iPhone All my assignments and books were sorted in that phone exactly how I needed it to be"
Samsung already had all that stuff Apple users get it and act like its completely new its actually old
1812 The watch tan is crazy lmao
Come on Marques you should know that you cannot be sure the AOD is having an impact on the battery until you have owned it for 2 or 3 weeks
Dynamic Notch sounds better apples gonna be apple tho
I hope you stomped that Lanternfly  Lol
Dont tell me those are tesla surfboard
Apple is not ahead mainly because of their innovation but because of their topclass marketing Nobody sells a product better than them
Couldnt care less about iPhone just here for another MKBHD video
my guy trying hard to sell the new shit
What is the widgets you are using
the dynamic Island its a inspirstion from Huawei honor 20 in my perspective Apple look for other brands and some spec overthink  the only feature I like from the new ios its the notifications in the bottom
Lol dynamic island Copied
Bro I will know when I am in a carcrash
Dude so far what I am hearing is something that was already a given The phone can call 911 without having any service That SOS feature will no longer be free after 2 years Apple market to gullible people sad part only USA buy these phones The rest of the world are using Android Esim is to track you hell all the phones are created to track you I started with Apple went to Samsung and have not looked back since
So Android eventually bent Apple to change the shitty outdated notch
Guys I have the 7 plus   will getting the pro and not max be ok  Size of the overall phone is a bit smaller but screen roughly bigger on the pro  Help 
Apple is a trend setter love it or hate it other manufacturers will copy Apple
a clown phone for clown people
Over rated notch crap
I switched to Android around iPhone 12 launch No desire to come back Came here to watch what was cool with the 14 Just me or still pretty boring
iPhone 14 Pro would have made the movie Fall a lot shorter
"      God demonstrated His love to us by sending His Son Jesus Christ who died and rose from the dead to Give us eternal life He also promised to heal your body If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead Hell give you eternal life
Look up at the sky and ask God"
Ah
Nice hoodie
Enjoy this video The iPhone 13s
Should I upgrade my iPhone 13 upgrade to iPhone 14 Pro  Or should I wait for 15
Someone on Facebook has been arguing with me about how his s8 has a better camera than the iPhone 12 Pro Max XD
Please nobody coppy this   Masking a hardware flaw with software  is only an act of desperation   Its like sweeping dirt under furniture
Your such a great inspiration to people showing that you can still make incredible quality videos
this dynamic island thing is so overrated a floating blank space on the screen with a line of pixels above it will be so distracting while watching a video Anyway who am i to complain even if i sold both of my kidneys i wont be able to afford this phone
this guy has better production quality than apple ads
Yeah the AOD is the less fav for me Many other phones did it better But the dynamic Island is refreshing Is it true tho if you put it under the direct sun you can see the gap between the camera and the sensors
Hmm
i think i know what i want for Christmas 
Why make a big improvement if people will buy it anyway Waste of money for Apple
Im confused whether to go with 14 or pro  Could u pls help me wit it 
mkbhds intro is far better than apples own intro XD
Brush ur hair  thats an ugly ass hoodie
The iphone 14 pro max is now sold in Morocco for 2000 usd
What about fingerprints constantly getting on front camera its seen even in this video its a giant pain point i feel after the novelty wears down if theres a setting to disable it people will prefer to turn it off
Yep just you
SNice tutorialt its the nice tuto
Is it true that the US variants esim have like unusedfree space where the sim tray used to be Like it has nothing in that particular place
Why didnt you show how the hole looks when youre watching videos
The Dynamic Island shall henceforth be known as the DI
Hoodie season Checks outside temp 96
Have you noticed any problems using the new iPhone 14 Pro or Pro Max in certain social media apps
Currently rocking an iPhone 8 Pro I kept putting offhave put off upgrading for a while iPhone 8 Plus has been quite suitable for my needs for a long time now But its about that time I think the 14 will be my new phone Anyone else in a similar situation thinking of purchasingupgrading to this phenomenon phone
Im 16 years older than Marques Brownlee I was very antitechnology in my youth but this young man has gotten me so excited as well as interested in everything Tech My knowledge has increased my desire to learn and Ive actually made some really decent purchases because of his recommendations I just love this channel and the continent provides Cheers to MKB
How awesome is Marques and his reviews Hes straight up not biased gives you the lay of the land whats awesome what sucks  and everything in between hes just a fantastic human being no wonder hes so popular 
Im a 12 Pro Max user and I dont think any of these new features make me want to get the 14 Hopefully next year is better and Ive been saying that for 2 years now sigh
What is the always on vantage
I see the rubiks cube 
The dynamic notch is so ugly and I hope other phone companies dont follow suit  iPhone users laughed at hole punch cameras and now they have a pill sized punch out and all of a sudden its cool and dynamic  Give me a break
L
"I suggest watching Flossy Carters video about the iPhone 14 ProMax and Tyler Stalman for the camera review 
To be honest always on display was not first in iPhone but Apple definitely did it best Apple is using the notch to make it more productive And Apple engineers work behind the features like Car crash detection will save the lives of millions of people around the world just like Apple Watch has been doing with the fall detection or arrhythmias 
iPhones design is cool I mean if it isnt broken dont fix it "
This blackie needs to be put in place
What about close up pictures  My iPhone 12 Pro Max is terrible for up close
Hey was just wondering what the little calendar widget on your lock screen was Looks clean
The dynamic island is an eyesore and distracts the viewing experience much more than the notch Theyve got to find a way to get rid of notchdynamic islandpunch holes and hide the front camera behind the display
Crash detection was there in Google in pixel 3 
Me watching on my iPhone 8 with black spots in the middle of the screen and the text shakes up and down 
Decades old legendary Lighting port in 2023
dont ride apple Samsung already had hole punch cut out and between mods and wallpapers people have already made similar stuff happen Once again apple is stealing i mean Innovating
ive been a dedicated android fan for quite some time now the only apple product Ive ever owned was an iPad mini 4 Im really considering switching to this phone I really like where apple is going with this
I have an 11 pro max Is it worth the money for an upgrade
What the heck does thats also pretty clutch mean Cmon just review the phone
Good grief these intros are next level
There is a lot of scope for getting prints on the front camera setup while using the Dynamic Island
I understand the capacitance thinks companies have reached in terms of new tech in New phones yearly but this is a joke
My dude needs hand lotion
LOL you mentioned connecting airpods twice
I need an update I have an XR 
I dont see anything that makes me want to go back to iOS right now I also think the dynamic island is a short term feature Eventually the face id works will get smaller theyll eventually figure out how they want to implement the under display front camera and the dynamic island will go the way of force touch after a few generations
The framing of the Marques scenes in this seem much tighter than usual but I could be wrong At first I thought my LG C1 was displaying the video incorrectly Regardless love the channel  the podcast Thanks for making dope content
1815 THE WATCH TAN IS INSANEEEEE
No physical sim tray is a deal breaker for me to go for Samsung
This phone is a phone worth buying its better value than the galaxy lineup imho
Its so happy everyone us excited about this fone ip14 but doze people like ne cannot afford this im using my ip xr for a year now
YOUR TITLE SHOULD BE ANDROID PILL REMASTERED
watching iphone 14 pro its pretty great sorry for yall
Why you didnt review the Galaxy fold yet
I would be interested in seeing a iPhone 14 pro vs Samsung Galaxy s22 ultra comparison video
Products way sexier than I thought itd be
i have been watching your videos for a very long time all i have to say now KEEP EM COMING
Always iPhone baised nothing new here
Android has basically have had dynamic island such a goofy name for years all u gotta do is swipe down on ur screen and boom u got ur self basically a better dynamic island Also how are u supposed to have network coverage on other countries that dont have eSim Since ur not able to get a sim card from them
1554 BURN THE BASTARD
This look to me like a iPhone from 2015 jailbrake full of tweaks
so now the new iPhone doesnt have a massive notch and only a massive cut out similar to the S10 Im will to switch from Samsung to try it out Ive had Samsung phones for 5 years how bad will I regret this
I still have the iPhone 6Swaiting for 16Pro Max
Marquis please test out the camera at the Conservatory of Flowers definitely the spot for photos Lmk if you want a tour Love your honesty in your videos
LG was so underrated but novel in many of their designs  The LG V10 was a great phone It was an absolute missed opportunity that they couldnt build off the platform  Curve displays multiple cameras  notebooklike phoneLG was so creative
Im hoping the s23 will have a sim tray or at least an optional one
the dynamic island is very clever  If they came out with this in the first release of iphone with the dead spot 10 nobody would have cared that is was a camera spot stuck in the middle of the screen  Its possible it turned away sales when seen as a glaring defect  Now it is a feature that sits in idle mode waiting for your input  The bounciness makes it like a living thing  Apple thought well we cant hide it so lets turn it into something that comes alive  brilliant combination of hardware and software
ThT his real voice 
I like looking at things i cant afford
The intro is very cool 
The dynamic island feels much larger then the prior notch and I think it distracts too much from using the screen
Dynamic Island just means you never know how much of any iPhones screen will be blocked
Apple still collecting every iPhone location 247  Spoke can access your phones content any time they want  The phone for sheeple
Ahh yes now you get less screen
LOOK AT THIS GRAPH
I really like that iPhone wallpaper where can I find it
"Ill stick with my 13 pro max 1tb 
The odd number is always the better iphone 
 the no physical sim is the worst idea since well no physical sim "
Apple needs to come out with the AOD on the iPhone 13 series They could do a software update on the phones COME ON APPLE
eSIM only Nonsense will be the undoing of Apples Sales in the US They fail to realize many US Iphones are bought and sold in other countries where eSIM has extremely low uptake or none at all  Apple has taken its arrogance to another level They will learn why the CDMA non SIM system failed against the GSM SIM system
I wonder if theyre ever gonna bring 3d touch back to the iPhone Its the one feature I miss the most back from when I had an iPhone 8
That intro tho
Has the iPhone reached its peak
I like how you remembered that we had a similar feature in the LG V10 with the dynamic Island
The real question here is can we stitch camera while recording now Im tired of having to stop and switch in order to record from different views
Where the heck is that wallpaper from Its awesome
No kudos for being first Motorola had one of the first fingerprint scanners It was so awful they removed it That LG bar you are talking about Same thing It wasnt even a part of the display It was its own strip Quickly retired Its like praising the first person to think of solving world hunger without even remotely achieving it
Is this phone a big enough upgrade from the iPhone 11 Pro Max
What nonsense You will always dirty the phones camera until it gets scratched Of course it will be copied because unfortunately Apple sets the trend no matter if its crap or something revolutionary America banned Huawei for example which was the ONLY true competitor for Apple What can I sayvery fairIm already starting to get annoyed by this worship of Apple
"RIP LG Mobile
pours liquor"
Apple phones are old iron That pro camera is OLD Nokia make that 2012 
Another pass for me I have the 12 mini and it gets all the stuff I need done pretty good I will consider switching if they come out with a version that uses usb
I travel and not having a sim will make me pause on 14
What is that widget that is being used on the lock scree that looks like a bunch of dots Is that a calendar widget of some sort
Watching on my iphone 14 pro max great device
As a AssistiveTouch power user I really want the dynamic island feature
Nice review
Smash the phone on concrete to test the car crash function
Dynmaic Island is a gimmick like touchbar
"That satellite communication Free for  2years after that we must be paid  is it true 
If yes  Apple has a another source of income true monopoly"
I have an XR do you guys recommend upgrading to a 14 pro
I got this and the camera is HUGE
Did he just literally dropped an Iphone on purposeholyshit
Bro never smiles in pictures
what is this calendar widget on the lock screen
1322 Didnt see that coming lmao
Bro dropped the phone and I felt my heart skip a beat
where u get that wallpaper from 
So the island is just a notification area for lazy people who does not know how to swipe down from the top
"1050 okay so Ive spent some time with it now and I disagree
Everywhere else in iOS contextual action is always a long press
Control center quick app actions everything thats an inplace action is a hold
It makes no sense to open a widget on a tap and open the app when holding"
I love how Marques just sounds like he wants to die
Pass
I think Im the only human alive who doesnt mind the name Dynamic Island 
Did he just drop an I phone 14 on the groundintentionally 
Yeah as you say it will be copied by  APPLE itself Same as IP1213you can barely say any difference the rest is just a BS for an average Joe AON display  software function that could be implemented to any Oled without really sacrificing too much of a battery life faster CPU oh wow  my YT and FB will be 60 faster And the greatest feature ever dynamic island just to introduce another ground breaking feature around iphone 18 pro  no island or magic eye available in any even low budget android phone today yeah Im talking about just a camera eye on the screen rather then notches and other BS
Going to this from the iPhone SE 2nd generation my phone dies twice a day and I barely use it 
I wonder if someone will use a GAS RC car and crash it on purpose to test out the Crash Detection Just strap the phone to it
OMG MARQUES LISTENS TO  CLPPNG LOVE IT
my contract is up soon and i cant decide what phone to get next
Just picked up the 14 pro anybody notice the pics come out a lot colder looking than the 13 pro
Im here for the man not the machine 
Def not worth the upgrade from 12 dont waste your money
Hope your knee gets better
I think ought to be called the floating island like the desert
Has Marques switched to Todoist
IMHO the camera bump looked already too prominent in the 13 now its unacceptable Unless you use a cover Most people do but not all
What Calendar widget are you using on your lock screen
I can get the new phone for like 8 bucks a month with verizon by trading in my 12 pro max I might as well do it Its 8 bucks and my job genuinely ruins phone to where i need a new one in 2 years 3 if i get lucky
Thank you for the LG shoutout watched a ton of reviews from other YouTubers but none of them mentioned it but again MKBHD is the goat for a reason
selfie shots will always have finger print smears if you dont remember to wipe the pill clean
Its Nothing like that LG
They are not in most advanced  Only same models just some updates only
I have no problem with the name dynamic island
Will hope getting usb c and 8k video next year
I humbly say buy an Indian iPhone to just get sim tray Now in India there is no carrier locking
I think apple did the no Esim thing to try and combat thieves Its harder to steal when there is no chip and can be tracked as long as the phone is on and everyone cant use it cause its harder to remove the information
Best intro Ive ever seen Kudos to editor 
Can I record normal 4k in iphone 14 pro 128GB model 
I wish I could by a updated LG V20 today  My fave phone to date
Hey marques im still rocking the iPhone X for 4 years now and i was waiting for the 14 Pro but now im underwhelmed as they didnt go to USBC and the notch is now more intrusive in videos should i get it anyway or save a lil bit of cash and go for the 13 Pro or wait for the 15 Pro
"Saying LG invented the Dynamic Islands concept is very dumb at best At worst its a sad attempt to trigger Apple haters
And lets be clear I dont think theres any genius in that feature Dynamic Island is just a well marketed notification system on the top of the screen as its existed since almost forever except its built around an ugly punchhole camera to make it look cool And the LGs one isnt any of that except its another notification system
So if youre saying Apple copied from LG the idea of marketinggimmick notification system is that even something LG should be proud of
Come on Apple of course takes good features from other companies like everybody does but this is absolutely not the case"
I currently have the LG v60 dual screen and it seems like this phone would be a great upgrade would definitely go with the pro max tho
i dont get this obsession with better cameras Were viewing images on a tiny tiny 7 screen and even smaller in apps like Instagram I think phone makers are pretty out of touch with their focus or maybe they just dont know how to innovate on actual user experience
"What a load of BS As if eSims were only available in the US

I go to South America frequently and the easiest thing to do is get a prepaid eSim online"
Still the best looking videos on Youtube
Want the hoodie for my birthday 
eSIM is great and it is by no means a limitation  look at DENT dentwireless operator free calls global operator
Googles car crash detection was so good that apple had to copy it also lmao
The LG mention was wholesome We miss you LG You did well while you were around and now that youre gone we appreciate the things you pushed forward but sadly didnt succeed
What if they copyright the dynamic island
This phone is a waste of time pretty much like the 12 and 13 speaking from experience   unrepairable  have buy a different phone
"Hey Marques Awesome video as always
I have a question  are you going to make a comparison video for Samsung G22 vs iPhone 14 and G22 vs iPhone 14 Pro etc"
good lord the camera sticks out a mile on that thing
What are those dots on your lock screen widget
i feel like roller coasters could be a false crash detection caused since theyre loud and have a lot of starts and stops
"Apple should have opted to call it DYNAMIC PILL instead of DYNAMIC ISLAND

But then at the end of the day their company their branding We just have to go along with whatever or however they call their new phone features"
not my problem but anyone does try to copy this like Samsung or smt apple should definitely sue em Apples 14 pro will always be the OG those copies would never make out near
Watching your videos on full screen on a 14 and having the island just floating there is so strange Not nearly as annoying as having the video shrunk and having 14 of the island peaking in
Lol all Im hearing is this phone will add a million more ways for people to be watched and tracked
Only for Indians Conclusion of the Review is Are baap re ye to dhoti khol rha hai
                  
What is his wallpaper
In other wordsno need to upgrade 
Speaking on the car crash detection accidentally triggering the watch has for a while had the fall sensor And it triggers a lot more than it should For example playing with the dog and hitting the ground or playing basketball
Dynamic Island the iphone new Taskbar for the iphone lol I like it it really looks cool
I hated the concept of apple changing to the pill cut out because I had become so used to the notch that I really didnt mind it But I actually like the name dynamic island it sounds more appealing and interactive than pill
Anyone know the name of the app for the calendar widget displayed on the lock screen at 141
Marques likes Graduation Extra respect
you havent mentioned the dynamic island with the sunlight directly on it any reason why screens cant reach true black
Satellite
The seagulls 
I bought an A32 5g for 160  and I have consumed so much content about applesamsung and all the other phones on this phone  that I am reassured it is such a waste of money to drop a grand on a mobile device Dont get me wrong if you got the cash do it up but the majority of people dont
What is that Lockscreen dots widget
Good intro
"As an android user the dynamic Island seemed pretty interesting to me until I realized that iOS does not show notification icons in the status bar
It shouldve always been a feature 
But I agree the implementation is pretty cool"
1400 in Norway 
If Apple allowed Floating window feature and side loading of apps i will switch to apple
"Why doesnt the entire display except for the important stuff turn off with the Always on display 
Wouldnt that save much more battery 
Seems counterintuitive"
UUGGLLYY IDEEAA
MKBHD is the OG of reviewers
Hai Marq can you share the wallpaperthank you
Whatever that other brands maybe came up with so many features first they will copy what Apple does thats the thing Like when Apple introduced the Touch ID people were like but LG did that first years ago so what Haha yes years ago and nobody cared you need that argument we did that first to start using it without having to feel that its a straight up copy from Apple lol
I currently own the iPhone 7 would I notice any difference if I got the 14 Pro
I am really amazed by the Dynamic Island You dont expect these types of upgrades between a generation They usually develop it over time It is working really smooth When it comes to other brands trying to copy this feature I dont even think it is a real problem As you already mentioned the internal hardware behind the Dynamic Island is one of its kind and not likely to be replicated by other brands The only concern I am thinking about is when you touch your front camera It might cause some problems especially if we consider we will have to touch it a lot if we really want to take advantage of Dynamic Island Kudos to the team behind this technology and you for making this video possible
What calendar widget is that on your Lock Screen I want it
How did nobody notice the different Dynamic Island when you were out and about
"Iphone X review music 
Sweet"
If Apple engineers can move the island up a few pixels the can make the dynamic peninsula notch  mind blowing animations slightly higher
Oneplus AOD 
does anyone know where to get that lockscreen wallpaper
You are so clever MKBHD We all know that notch thing will be copied and you just brought it up first xD
Me watching this video with my iPhone 7 
Gimmick id love to see an ipad the size of the iphone pro or just ipad os on this n support for their ipad pencil use
I dont see how its any different than SAMSUNGS Edge lighting which has been on samsung phone for years also imo this wastes a lot of screen realestate compared to hole punch which android has had hole punch and no bezel for years so iPhone copied android
AoD is too bright I think I wonder if Apple could allow a toggle in Settings to adjust down the brightness
for somebody with a pretty fast brain call it adhd the pretty nice fluidity makes me instantly put off 1005
Notchification
Anyone having issues with the camera vibrating in tik tok 
Can anyone link the WALLPAPER that he is using in the current videos Looks great but cannot find it
I find the island to be lame A desperate attempt at covering up the latgest punchout ever that looks awful when not dynamic Or maybe to hide the fact that its a copied feature that Samsung has introduced ages ago and has perfected by now What I like about Samsungs rendition is that it doesnt require you to use your phone with two hands Samsung has the most ergonomic phones including UI that is Dont buy it people a dancing notch is what you are getting wow
Hears the intro song leaves video goes to best video ever posted to YouTube The MKBHD 10 million subs video Comes back to post this comment
Hello there Not related to this video but I am planning to buy s21 fe for 400 usd I am happy with everything except the exynos 2100 chipset I cant get the snapdragon variant here is the exynos 2100 bad is it good for long term use as I am planning to stick with this for 3 yrs
poco is better
Intro 
Hey marques how would you call the dynamic island if you could rename it
Am I the only one that absolutely loves the name Dynamic Island 
Who copied to who
Disappointing no USBC 
Connecting AirPods connecting AirPods
"Dynamic Island is just a gimmick Still a punch holes but huge

The first mobile company releases an optimized inscreen camera thats a real innovation"
30 fps
Ill wait til my iPhone 8 Plus goes out 
Apple made a mistake by introducing the notch that blocks a screen it tries so desperately to needlessly enlarge and then covers it with something that blocks even more of usable screen Good job Tim Cook MBA and tech moron
so clearly MKBHD was on bumble im transitioning
Is it uncomfortable to pick up calls with the island notification which is at the top of the phone and hard to get to
I think Ill Will have the newest and latest because Im upgrading from not iPhone 11 nor 8 nor 7 From a venerable 6s my rate of iPhone upgrades is between 4 to 6 years so spending 1300 in this period I think its worth it
Good another episode of me watching and educating myself about things i cant afford
My 78 year old mother has a 108mp phone with 8 gigs of ram and isnt impressed
The island reminds me of staining the rest of your shirt because youre unable to remove one stain
the editing WOW
Will they be adding dynamic island to iphone 15s and will iphone 15 have 90hz
No type c in charging port is scam
Not updating this year but i absolutely love how Apple went and made something out of the Pillhole punch So the notch was done new displays have holepill punch but instead of leaving at that  they built this cool feature As if no one will copy it and every should copy it such a simple idea its great
This dynamic island is just a screen notification and it is on top of a screen which is worst possible place this is literally useless and inconvenient
"Writing right now from an s20 and I must say the Dynamic Island is incredible Its such a shame that nobody found the solution for the puch hole as Apple did For the first time in a  long time an Iphone comes with something that captures my attention And yes I had an LG V10 and V20 too bad they never imbeded that in the software so well 
Lets see how competion will copy this feature moving forward since this is awesome"
6 GB ram in 2022
Actually Thousand Island makes a saucy name 
will notifications be able to make use of the dynamic island like when you receive new messages etc
Keep my iPhone 13 Pro
Ill keep my S21 Ultra 5g for another 4 years then upgrade Thankfully the upgrade every year mentality is long gonegood riddance Enjoy your life peeps
Love the vid format as always but not sure how this is a review after the phone just came out Maybe should of been an initial impressions video
Sorry I have been really meaning to ask you this for the longest time possible    Are you Nigerian 
Wordle 
viewing video must be terrible on this
damn i just bought the normal iphone 14 and the camera section of this video just made me regret my decision to not buy the pro
Cant believe the LG V10 is 7 years old
When i can find this wallpaper its really cool
My problem is the 48 megapixel camera is only active on the main camera with no adjustments whatsoever Once you zoom in or zoom out it defaults to the 12 megapixel I think the 48 megapixels is going to be a lot less useful than people think
How much his intro is better than apples commercials
That front camera gonna be blurry with all those DI taps
How much RAM does the iPhone14 have
Is this a good upgrade from 13 pro
I need this for ones reason and one reason only even though I have a 13 pro uufffff that purple man
MBKHDs intros are extraordinary
My apple watch asks me if Ive started a workout when I socialise with people lmao
Im NoT GoInG tO tEsT tHaT
i still feel that the Dynamic Island should have been an update and not a feature that is focused on for a new iPhone
Its called the Dynamic Island Get over yourself  I was listening to the waveform podcast where you guy were discussing the pill cutout of older phones and Dynamic Island you were calling everything the pill cutout and it sounded utterly ridiculous and confusing when you have terminology to differentiate that you refused to use SMH
Is the lowlight video quality on the iphone 14 and 14 pro the same
Picked my 14Pro up yesterday in Apple Store UK coming from 13 Pro Max This phone is awesome battery life is awesome AOD is pretty cool but a late feature Dynamic island  is a really cool feature for multitasking multiple apps Cameras are amazing especially for detailed photos Coming from the 13 Pro Max I thought it would feel small but it fits better in the hand and is much lighter and easier to fit in your pocket and use when youre on the go Pretty impressed so far Awesome video MKBHD as always 
Which phones are best for Astrophotography I know youve mentioned them before but I cant remember
Always on  dying screens and batteries die faster fuckin shit
Anyone agrees with me  Buying a brand new 2genolder iPhone eg iPhone 12 in 2022 is just enough technically  and more gentle to your wallet
Wonder if space black is my copied idea from 3 years ago that apple has on a recorded line still looks ugly like space gray  Apple Black like on 7 plus is what I demanded with M1 Max and iPhone 12 and I expect my  for it too My ideas arent free
Many copied features are there frm Android lol apple wont change in being late and copying things frm Android 
Another phone i will not buy
Always on display  Ill pass on that shit Dont need it easier for douche bags to creep on my phone
I just tested the crash detection today and it set off after me stoping after going 20mph
IT really do connect airpods
this guys better at making apple ads than apple
An adjustable always on display brightness would be stellar
When u gonna do AirPods 2
I went from a 12 mini to this one Its a neat upgrade so far
What is the dots widget in the Lock Screen 
Did anyone notice the aperture actually gets worse at  f178 for wide and f22 for ultra wide compared to iPhone 13 Pro Max at f15 for wide and f18 for ultra wide Isnt smaller is better in capturing low light Did Apple purposely make it this way so that they could improve it next year 
Did they get rid of that horrible green lens glare
great vid one thing Id like to touch about the always on display is that it actually adjusts to the lighting so if youre in a dark room the always on will be a lot dimmer and vice versa keep up the good work though man i love it
Fuck Apple Apple ruin simple consumer rights that other phone manufacturer provides
Coming from an 11 pro max the difference with the 14 pro is night and day
Copied Id wager improved but whatever
"Didnt you just kinda snitched yourself at the beginning
And I love the way you just casually test the dbrand cases"
Where did you get this wallpaper
"Pixel has had crash detection for years

The dynamic island app switcher is stupid because its not a one handed operation function like the Google app switcher"
The Dynamic island wont be used much by me It requires the user to use a second hand to reach the top I think most users will play with it for about a month or two and then just ignore it
Microphone hear a loud noise Dont have sex in the same room you have your phone
Thats weird that they didnt switch to USBC because England is trying to force them to
Seems like a boring iPhone update
I just got IOS 16 and it has been amazing
PSA Kill that bug at 1553
Hii
732 well laddy fricken dah good for you not caringlittle spoiled imowhen you upgrade from a 7 year old S7 that feature is beautiful
Will it still do 2 lines now that it is esim only
Honestly I would say its still a worthy upgrade from a 13 Pro The new hardwaresoftware such as the beefed up cameras and Dynamic Island makes glaring differences from last years iPhones Now do you HAVE to upgrade your 13 Pro to a 14 Pro Oh absolutely not Its all about preferences atp
I have the iPhone 13 pro Ive been wanting a bigger phone Should I get the 14 pro max
Think Im a wait till the 15
Too bad the notch is just bad when watching videos and playing games Will be copied lul
Black pill sound expansive to fix lol
That esim is going to be a major problem in the Caribbean ha
RIP LG MOBILE 
What breed of canine is that
Thank you for saying that this video will continue after 233 really informative stuff I liked when the video continued
Looks like Apple is somehow spooked with the Nothing phone
Wont touching the dynamic island put fingerprints on the selfie camera
"Apple is great at selling people on the journey 
They will convince you that a notch or oval black hole not a mere notch or blacked out screen occlusion but a portal through which the present and future is absorbed Bullshit You just havent figured out how to cheaply put your camera and sensors behind an active LCDOLED  

I like the notch better than a big oval"
Excellent review as always not why Im here in the comments section though I just want to shout out your music tastes  J Coles Born Sinner Deluxe Edition diff cover art from the standard album Kanyes Graduation from his College series and a few others I wish there was a metaplaylist for this video on Spotify based off the songs that we see playing as part of the review 
This phone slowly turning to an android
Whats funny is that the dynamic island is a software update but apple sell it as a hardware update
Apple is running the greatest con in American history the same phone 4years running
Shout out to LG
"Please my iphone xs max is stuck in DFU mode and nothing is working even if I try to restore it
Please is there any solution for me"
Fingerprints on my front camera  brilliant innovation Cant wait
Is it just me thinking the front cameras gonna be blurry as youre touching it all the time with the dynamic island
For the everyday user yes the iphone photos will always look better thats why apple over processes the photos to death I prefer the unprocessed image that way i decide what to do with the content You could find an app to do raw photos 8n an iphone but thats just a software conversation its not natively in the camera itself
"This notch version is the worst of all Its just hurting my eyes Its too much down into the screen and super annoying to watch I hope android phones will never switch to this crap The best thing would be to put the punchhole more up so that it becomes a kind of micro waterdrop notch But this new Apple island notch is just disgusting It shows that they are done with innovation
But the isheep will celebrate it because its from apple its new and it has animations in it"
But what if you want to take professional level photos and you only have your iphone   This is where android smartphones have the advantage over the apple cameras the iPhone photos are over processed to look pretty but if you do pro content you want the lossless image and the native controls for both videos and photos in manual mode
We saw your Best Buy ad sorry dude
"1816 Marques hey buddy photo for the video
Dog Im I a joke to you"
the biggest iphone 14 pro max is 2099 in germany 
Yo Marques hows your knee What happened
So if my dash caddy for my phone drops this iphone in drive mode will it trigger crash detection
"Apple will have set the vehicle crash detection high enough to prevent false positives The Gforces are so much higher and you can press no

The apple way alwayson is using 1hz to have extra long battery life as the battery drain is more important than on a watch for showing the time"
Whats that wallpaper
What if you have a 12 mini and I want more battery life Upgrade
Dynamic island can only be used twohanded Not a value add in my opinion
The always on display is horrible compared to what weve seen in Android phones for the past 5 year
But as traveler to overseas like me I dont I think I have any reason to upgrade this 14 series No sim tray
"The Oneplus 9 Pro that you rushed review can still do 4k 120fps and 8K 30fps video and record in HDR and its last year tech
Unfortunately we dont see reviewers looking at Iphones with a critical thinking and Apple just keeps launching the same retouched phone No USBC no fast charging no underscreen finger print sensor changed the notch to a pill shaped punchhole that takes even more space added some animations and everyone gets crazy about it Its ridiculous"
THANK YOU SO MUCH THIS WAS EXTREMELY HELPFUL
Anyone got spamed by Motorola ads
Can You use an iPhone bought in USA elsewhere
since I still have the iPhone XR do yall think its worth it to upgrade to the iPhone 14 pro models
"Test the Satellite reception Marques




PS Shoutout to LG Still miss em"
Anyone familiar with his widget setup
should i get this phone i currently have an iphone XR
Please mention the widget you used on lock screen
Reason I will get the iPhone 14 is for the satellite connectivity I fly small aircraft in remote Canadian areas and always carry a spot gps for the unexpected event of a crash A device I have to constantly make sure works and also pay 300year for something I may never use So having this in the phone will pretty much pay for the phone by getting rid of my spot
ready for iPhone 15
For Gods sake just get rid of the notch Itd not a feature its in the way
"The fact that people arent chomping at the bit for new iPhone models these days aside from being partially the fault of leaks is a testament to just how far theyve come and how good they are now generally speaking These days your model however old is probably perfectly good enough for day to day use with minimal drawback of the latest

Lets face it Foldables are a dream that people are so desperate to come true that theyre willing to overlook the glaringly obvious fact that to this day they are still nowhere near ready for mainstream adaptation The screen crease gap and thickness when folded are all compromises that should be unacceptable but people force themselves to overlook them for a dream that still isnt truly possible Apple will only introduce it if and when that dream does finally become a reality They dont typically bring out a feature before its ready not talking software without bugs here"
I have a iPhone 8 rn I wanna upgrade should I get a iPhone 13 pro or this new iPhone 14
I dont think the always on is specifically mentioned in battery settings but I think its probably part of the home and lock screen usage category when you look at the battery graph
Magic Island is moving many controls to the top Finger stretching madness Nicely animated but a hell to control the UI Samsung Android and other went ways to put the UI under your fingertips And now everything will be pushed to the far top again What a waste
"Big round of applause for Android and Android Operating Systems








what would the iPhone be without it "
iOS 16 on an iPhone X is rough
the 48mp camera is actually a 12mp camera using a bayer array So no its not that special
Maybe skydiving will activate the crash detection sensors Im a skydiver and its normal for us to have the phones on us and we decelerate from 120140mph to stop in 2 seconds Itll be interesting to see that
"1 year 1 new phone

Dear Lord these phone companies need a BREAK"
Negative reviews of this video Just curious why the negative reviews Whats wrong with the video Curiosity killed the cat
Nothing to do with this videobut now iOS 16 doesnt allow me to control the volume straight front the Lock Screen  No volume bar anymore Wooooow
Is anyone else looking at the tesla surf board in the background and trying to understand  Did tesla make it but why Is it just for show as it looks fragile with the little badge etc as for the phone yeah its a small update as per from Apple As per everyone will moan about it and as per then eventually buy it  im typing this from my 14 pro 
ESIM only US means  less travellers buying phone from USA smart move by apple
Iphone is dead
Great video mkbhd but in my opinion I wouldnt upgrade as the 14pro is basically a minor software upgrade
Dynamic island more like camera sensor island with a window that takes up space around it to hide it omfg Apple Bring back iPhone 5 days
thx
Mkbhd iphones reviews only watched by   people who cant afford mostly
Where could I download this wallpaper Thanks
"It shows that marques can walk around with the new iPhone and no one noticed 
Why cant they just get rid of the notch arent apple engineers good enough  Steve jobs would sort it out
Brazil  is never going to see the iPhone  14  Why no usbc or foldable iPhone  

Like the marques hoodie 
Maybe with the satellite feature maybe apple have an evil goldeneye Satallite"
Did you buy it 
all these new features are really good but would be REALLY cool to be able to put your alarm clock on repeat by pressing everyday button instead of every montue wed etc
Dont be shy tell us where did you get the wallpaper from
This would have been an S year upgrade for the iphone
Why not make at Dynamic Island thing either something the user can turn on or off or only appear when there is a notification At the very least disappear when youre taking a picture or video or watching a video
The lack of physical SIM is something that Id have to look at  I do have to periodically travel to Guam and as a Verizon subscriber service not available there  Previously Id just arrange online prior to travel and have a SIM card waiting for me at the hotel desk when I arrive  Will have to check to see what my options are for virtual sims to allow me to continue using my device while there  I dont typically replace the SIM for travel to JapanKorea as there are already Verizon partners that support international roaming in those countries
Good advice I have a 12 mini and Im ok for now Thanks for the reality check 
look at this graph lol
why must we go tropical with the iphone 14 pro
The island is going to be annoying for people with small hands
Whats the name of the wallpaper ur using
only bad part is that damn esim
You can now actually install a Dynamic Island on your android phone so its not a special feature for iPhone 14 pro only  so I see no point of upgrading to iPhone 14 model anymore
Its already ported to Android
What app has that calendardot widget Thats clean
Bla bla bla play pubg cool
705 I need that wallpaper
Dont get it if you have a 13 Especially with iOS 16
Now everyone who buys an Iphone 14 pro will become an Island boy
JCole Born sinner
Underwhelming phone
Marques legit going superstar mode 
Personally I think that dynamic island is a cool feature But if Im being real with myself I would probably only use it for the first few weeks After that Ill probably use my phone the way I normally use my previous iPhone So yeah I think its a gimmick but a cool gimmick
When I want an objective easyflowing viewpoint on anything tech I head over to Marques channel
does the dynamic island support the calculator The whole reason I havent switched to iphone is their lack of multitasking If I can quickly snap between an app and calculator Id make the switchcan anyone out there let me know
Whats the widget on your lock screen under the time on the left 
I think apple just saw googles aod animation and they couldnt resist making it
u should do a video comparing every iOS on the phone in which it released with
Got some issues with my 12 for cell servicedata and maybe some battery stuff as well not really sure yet though Do I go for the upgrade
Esim is also a pain when upgrading to a new phone I was using an esim on a pixel3 and when I went to upgrade to the pixel4 the carrier did not have a way to transfer the esim to the new phone They ended up sending me a physical sim card  I havent tried esim again since  This was a few years ago I hope they have got all that worked out now
That dynamic island is a classic example of its not a bug its a feature
Im thinking they just about got what theyre going to get with a cellphone and are focusing on the glasses My phones still half a decade away from needing an update with changes like this they arent selling me anything in the meantime
I think my argument to the 8k video taking up too much storage space would be that Apple could use that as a selling point for their iCloud storage expansion options since most people have wifi or unlimited data through there cellular provider which gives the ability to upload any video in the background I think the more prominent drawback is the extensive drain in battery
1600 isnt that the species of moth with red eyes thats been cropping up everywhere in NYC What is that Edit answering myself theyre an invasive species called the Spotted Lanternfly
Awesome  phone 
"A notch is still a notch no matter how many animations you wrap around it
Im gonna take my chances and wait for the 15 in case they improve it again"
I dont know why people or at least youtubers are so hyped by the  dynamic island  Why would anyone want to interact with a cutout at the far top  Its so painful and annoying 
Im sure the people sleeping the night in front of Apples flagship store before 16 Sept just to lay their hands on the first units of the new phone series do not even bother what new tech exists and if any of such new tech would even benefit them in any way
I wonder now that apple made the dynamic island are other manufacturers gonna be more turned off by under display cameras
I honestly dont get the need for always on displayany input
You are so smart I just  love your videos
how does dynamic island work when the phone is horizontal
Probably by Samsung
As an astrophotographer who hikes for all of my shots I would love to see improvement to their astrophotography mode It is really behind many others I have seen and I think this is the only thing this camera system truly falls apart on
wow the no SIM is crazy  the purple looks amazing 
Best Tech Reviewer in this planet right now
Love that purple color
Very very useless iPhone
marques  whats the widget that you have on the lock screen with those calendartype dots
that notch is still ugly as hell
I turned on my always on display on my android phone when I saw apple adding this as a new feature 
Another great review from my favorite reviewer Keep it going bro 
so basically its all the same
Does anyone know where I can get the Calendar Lock Screen widget he is using I assume its a calendar with dots
Just call it Di
Mehhhhhh
Anyone know where to find the phone backgroundwallpaper he has in this video
Apple island 
"Im still not seeing whats so great about the dynamic island Other than fancy animations 
My notification bar already gave me most of this information"
Love the new transitions and graphics in the intro
How about being about all done saying the words low key and sick 
dynamic island feels like 3D Touch and Touch Bar  it will go away in 34 years
1142 nice
the island thing is actually pretty neat and i look forward to having something similar on android preferably as a floating widget that can be moved around to either side of the phone where you can reach it having it at the top is the worst position to reach onehanded but apple had to put it there because they were trying to lipstick the notch
When he said Ill leave that to when mentioning ProRaw Can someone tell me which youtubers he talked about Id like to check them out
This will be copied you werent wrong sir The handset is Xiaomi They already brought it to the market just 3 days after the iPhones launch
No Underscreen camera will be copied
Upgraded from the 13 pro max to the 14 pro max mainly for the dynamic island Fantastic upgrade Also one more thing Usbc is trash Whichever phone is the last model to have lightning I will keep for as long as I can
That intro was just so dang beautiful
Just when I thought this is the time to change from Android to AppleSamsung as good as confirm a 200mp camera on the upcoming S23 Ultra Now Im back to square one of waiting for another model to come to market 
Apple copied dynamic island from Oppo 3 years ago Oppo did it and it concerned the camera opening in the upper left corner It looked better than the iPhone because it went further and had several more functions Apples AOD is bullshit This is just allways on with diminished brightness Apples shame Even more shame for copying
Whenever I see a intro  like that my thumb hits the like button on its own
IN MY PLAID LAST NIGHT I ACCELERATED IT FLEW IN THE BACK SEAT AND CRASH DETECTION CAME ON
All the reasons why Ill wait for 15 or 16 maybe Not so much upgrade from 14
What about the things iphone copied Like always on display
wallpaper
Boooring
Has anyone had problems with rapid battery drain on this phone I just got mine and the battery is acting suss
anybody know the song at 1945
Hello brather please give me a iPhone 14 pro max  Love from Bangladesh
Almost no logic to downgrade from Android to this iphone 12T No reason to still be buying an iphone in 2022 the competition are already superior Only for isheep
Apple could rename notch to dynamic island 5 years ago
You just took the excitement away from me from buying this iphone today 
"I wonder if theyve fixed the light reflection in the camera 
Those light dots are annoying "
Not sure if this has been asked but what widget are you using on your lock screen for the calendar  Appreciate the minimalist look
If it is so good they should introduce the dynamic peninsula around the notch instead of create a big hole in the middle of the screen I really dont think that it is something that really stands out or justifies the upgrade Its way better to watch a video with a notch or a punch hole S22 ultra for example
This certainly is not a significant upgrade from a 13 pro or even that large from a 12 pro As someone who is coming from a XR I can say that the 14 pro has been a huge upgrade even though I have had it less than 24 hours Great video as always
Hope always on display isnt too bright as a bedside night clock
Whats that widget he has on the Lock Screen with the dots
I respectfully disagree as a Pixel 6 Pro owner I love that the screen isnt compromised by a distracting punch out I dont understand why anyone would be excited to lose screen real estate
Do Apple secretly pay you for promoting their product to buy for the viewer Cause it seems so
These Intros are better than apple promo videos 
Dynamic Island was already available on LG v10 like 7 years ago so stop calling it a new and innovative feature and that Android will copy it
He has a large following Its not surprising but I didnt know hes a YouTube star
Love the dynamic island
Is it ok to buy the phone now or wait a couple of months for any bugsissues to be fixed by Apple
So making the dynamic Island a touch feature do the increased fingerprints on the front facing camera and sensors affect them or are they invisible to it
carry your phone with or without a case
Dynamic Notch
"In india we are paying around USD 1600 for base variant of iPhone 14 pro not pro max just pro and we are not getting

 2 Crash deduction
2"
"Androids Hardware is already ahead
what to copysoftware"
Great video as usual and very detailed many thanks for your effort keep it up 
i wonder why no one talking about security issue with satellite connectivity must have been a VERY big issue if one of the Chinese manufacturer have similar capabilities 
why do people gatekeep features why do we act like both sides dont copy each other somehow
The Dynamic Island Is Actually A Cool New Feature
Does anyone know what calendar widget hes using on his Lock Screen Apples calendar widget doesnt look like that
Dynamic island is older than LG V10 was in the Palm Pre in their new Web OS that I believe LG purchased when Palm died
No differences except the design useless phone
The new iPhone display notification is already introduced in Samsung galaxy note long year back  But its comes on edge of the side and in apple it comes on the upper side of the display If it is wrong please make me the correction Thanks
The intro was one of the worse ones
"Dynamic island still a supermassive black hole in an otherwise nice display Thanks but no thanks my One Plus 7 pro has spoiled me in putting my notifications at the very top of the screen while also eliminating the front camera from the screen so I can forget that I actually have one I like that so much Im actually going to have a funeral for that phone when it does finally die on me 
But Apple zombies wont care"
"1106
1114 he said it two times haha"
Please do good in fantasy mr Cardinals receiver
A funny thought Since the camera is getting wider and protruding more and more each year it might be poking against my thighs by 2030
Got the 14 Pro yesterday and its cool but its not as cool as I thought it was during Apples presentation lol
"The thing is android is only 12 years away of having cameras under the display commonly No need to copy something from apple who have just made a holepunch notch 4 years late

That btw wouldve seriously be something I would be impressed by if apple would come up with thatdont even know anymore how long is is ago apple came up with something truly new revolutionizing Were they the first with fingerprint That might be it the last time they did something amazing with the iphone And that was nearly 10 years ago"
I like the name dynamic island its a great name
Where can I download the wallpaper
Everyone only has a motive to sell stuff to you Just sell Buy their stuff cause  Cause you need more stuff More stuff will make you happy  healthy  Just consume cause 1 is always better Wtf
I like this homescreen wallpaper How can I get it
Android already copied the dynamic island A guy with a galaxy phone had it on his phone i dont think its released to everyone yet though
im pretty ripped that darksky is losing support
Q1
I just love it when he pulls down Apples pants and reveals how late to the game they are when compared to other phones 3 4 5 years ago 
Cinematic mode already supported 30FPS at 1080p What we wanted was 24FPS Now we can have do 24FPS at both 1080p and 4K I am sure MKBHD meant we now have 24FPS
Say what you want about Apple but they always take it up a notch
1600 KILL IT 
924 I think theres a stuck green pixel just below the sensor
Never pre ordering a phone with xfinity mobile again I pre ordered my 14 pro max space back 1 tb literally the second it came live and here it is Saturday morning and still no shipping notice but yet my wifes that I ordered Saturday last week is coming today go figure
Dynamic Island is a pretty cool UI thing but the usability Like I dont wanna keep leaving thumbprints on my selfie camera all the time and also during live activities it takes up all that space so where do my notification app icons go
Love the Lord your God with all your heart soul mind and strength and love your neighbor as yourself Jesus said And come follow Me 
So nothing new
"Le me watching this video on my 200 android phone which bought almost 2 years ago
SedLyf"
Is it a glitch that the dynamic island shows when taking a screenshot I feel like it shouldnt show Mine shows when I take a screenshot Its so distracting
They needed to do it Reviewers have been complaining about the notch for years and years Its like moving the cameras to that horrendous diagonal layout but at least this makes the phone feel fresh and new in an attractive way I wish the dynamic island was a little smaller but the software they did made it at least not suck as much to have a giant hole in the middle of your screen
Does it still have 3 d touch 
I m watching this in a 14pro max
I love this phone I was lucky enough to get the phone yesterday after waking up at 5am I have been buying the latest iPhone every year this is the best so far
Cringe advert
Ive got a 12 Will drop the exposure to 0 and the night mode to the max and it takes pretty good pictures of the stars in total darkness You can play with colored lights off to the side for erects Would love to be able to take a picture of the moon though Still too bright to get a clear shot
XiaoMi ald copied
How can I get that wallpaper from the studio display in the background
Its honestly irrelevant that LG did it first They made some half baked shit that felt like a gimmick and nobody used The team at apple probably dont even know lg did it because nobody even knew about it
For example you have a threehour long timer running Are you sure you want this huge pill up there all this time An intrusive black hole in the middle of your screen estate What people forget the dead zone is still there And it is even made larger by the notifications Only Apple can make people believe that this is a brilliant feature Must be fun watching videos pictures and playing games

Im getting ready to update my S20 5g ultra and Im considering going back to Apple even tho I love my Samsung s20 and the new Fold 4 looks awesome as wellIm in two minds lol hard to pick
Sorry for the stupid question but where I can get that wallpaper
"I am not seeing any improvement on the Ultra Wide on the iPhone pro max 14 My testing shows its just a little warmer temperature photo Im not seeing any improvement on any details or sharpness
I am a commercial photographer and color editor  I just got my 14 promax yesterday and I will most likely take this phone back and stick with my 13 pro max I believe they pulled the 13 from their shelves because they knew it would kill the sale of the 14 Coming from an iPhone 13 pro max I am very disappointment in the ultra wide angle The new photon engine hype is nothing more than a small software tweak"
Tech nibba
I would like motorcycle crash detection for the phone and watch When I would brush my teeth my Apple Watch would ask if I was washing my hands so I turned that off Hopefully if I get into a motorcycle accident my watch will at least think I hit the floor and ask me if I fell
iPhone is good but pricey So one should learn how to save money while buying an iPhone 
Is it USB type C now though You havent mentioned that
MBHD starts his video off with Apple fuck your nda
                                                 
I will not be testing the most interesting features is not what I expected to hear
Why is it still not using USB C Intentionally crippling the phone just for profit
"So they finally realised how hated that notch things is huh Or rather perhaps How outdated and repetitive it has become So what to do

Well since nothing positive was ever associated with the word notch I guess the floating notch was out of the question lol And sure I guess I can get behind dynamic even though I think I wouldve preferred multi instead But island  Que atroz They shouldve gone with bar As in either the dynamic bar or the multi bar But I guess the word bar was tainted as well sighat least for Apple You know ever since that mostly disliked touch bar era  But hey For once Well done Apple Good original thinking and problem solving You did go the extra mile this time slove claps"
Crash detection is a nice thing but I worry a out false positives
now u can be tracked by satellite perfect for sheepole
My iPhone 13 Pro Max on ATT is using the esim
Apple and Samsung needs to slow down with production of phones Honestly as soon as we buy the newest version of one in a couple of month they be a newer one I mean sure its good to have new things but I think they should slow down a little
"Iphone 14 review This will be copied
Android phones that had a punch hole design 4 years prior "
Seems like apple has reached saturation point couple of years back
I think this is your best intro graphic so far Great job
Until there iPhone bevomes USB C Im not interested
Why i wanna give 1500 for this 
2000 people saying the same old stuffat this point nobody really gafwow a new phone amazing same as old phone People have the attetion spans of flies You all need your pacifier wow mom porn in my hand on demand I had a cellphone in 1996 that actually made and recived calls better than the garbage today At this point all that the masses of zombies want is internet in their hands Thats all these phones do and thats all they ever will do When the phone blows me and makes me a sandwhich on demand then ill be impressed otherwise seriously you have nothing new to say and you are boring
1742 really you would put it above the s22 ultra
Have to say 1300 the finger marks on the camera look ridiculous Front cameras get dirty on all phones from earshair but this is another level Major design oversight and needs addressing by Apple
I totally didnt wanna upgrade this year but I dropped my 12 ProMax from the top of my clothes line and now it doesnt register the camera  got some places on the screen where touch doesnt register super quickly Kinda glad with the camera updates tho
The dynamic island looks cool But in the end its putting lipstick on a pig The huge cutout is ugly and in a world where you hold your phone in your hand I much rather have an under the display fingerprint scanner That way my screen is completely usable And all the things the cool animations of the dynamic island allows you to do are all available in every other phone But there theyre called active notifications I hope this marketing stunt doesnt become a trend
"when the hoes from the movie The Fall didnt upgrade  and now
 the new iphone has satellite connectivity"
I hate the auto HDR on the iphone and how it cannot be turned off like in previous iterations of the phone This started with iphone 13 and it is a huge disappointment I hope they fixed some of this with the iPhone 14
"Honestly the Dynamic Island feels like such a backward UI design Apple was supposed to move on from that former form over function philosophy but now theyre putting UI elements right on the fringes of the upper screen Imagine how many people will accidentally drop their Pro Max phones because they try to onehandedly reach for that phone call 
 
Androids leap in ergonomics just gets bigger and bigger"
Just checked the price of the iPhone 14 Pro Max 1TB going for R41 499 South African ZAR which equals to 235593 Is that the price currently for this phone in the US I think its absolutely madness for this iPhone to pass the 2000 price point
You are so stupid uneducated and silly that you call a great idea to differentiate yourself from the rest a copy when it doesnt even look like it and almost didnt even exist Donkey more than donkey
How is the dynamic island going to work with screen protectors And will it not constantly have fingerprints or dirt on the lens if it is constantly being touched Just some thoughts I generally like the island though
nice bro
Satellite Connectivity  Im sure thats triggering all the conspiracy bois 
I dont like the looks due to the notch style i prefer the iphone 13 to pro max than this
"Animations and notifications arround the notchhole in the scrren been in android for YEARS  and as allways apple taking all the credit and prays for doing it 5 years latter
This f world"
If theres any Yemeni person His sweatshirt colors like our flag
yup starting to save up to upgrade from just the 11
Nice camera review
1501 you really said non perfect condition while showing  perfectionhow dare you
Not happy with the punch hole cutout
Disagree on the camera front as well with the overall very positive vibes of the review The Verge one is much more objective and thorough
Excellent review by far the best channel available when it comes to these products
I have had the crash detection go off multiple times while driving if you give your phone to a 2 year old on a road trip and their show ends the phone gets thrown and itll go off
What about Satellite connectivity with Starlink from Elon Musk
Where can i get the wallpapers youre using
I like how he is just be dropping these thousand dallor phones like its nothing
we already have more elegant choice like asus flip camera  transparent display but no apple choose big island cut that hard to ignore
I hope you killed that lantern fly lmao
can i get your demo iphone 14 pro im looking to get one butttt
Ive had my iPhone 11 for almost 2 years Its good but I think I want to upgrade The 14 pro max is soo much better
Lets be more serious Marques Brownlee  Lets not demonize marketing The  dynamic island has no applications Apple has not moved the notifications to that specific spot of the screen  because it still maintains the notification center  LG called it a second screen and it is a space at the top of the screen to expose a series of apps that the user could access or use them directly The dynamic island is visually new it is dynamic it is different it is an animation of functionalities of the operating system the staging of utilities in real time
    mahmoud farahat 
Ill always miss LG and Steve Jobs
Great Work Mate From Portugal
Can somebody please tell me whats the name of the widget that looks like a binary watch on the lockscree
Ike me to make Marques go to a remote island to test the satellite feature
Man i have never felt so satisfied watching videos about tech other than yours
Im just gonna wait for the 15
where can you find the I cant make you love me remix that plays in the intro
Please stop with ironies and with the gesture they are so cringy and disgusting no hate i like ur videos but these 2 things just doesnt look good at all
I dont like the dynamic island too much It unfortunately protrudes deeper into the screen so it covers a part of your video right now on the side where i hardly had something covered with the notch
In Dynamic display arent we sometimes touching on front cameras too Smudgy photos incoming
Am I going to have to worry about my front camera being blurry more often because of the dynamic island
Why not use a full black color wallpaper in lock screen to make it look like android AOD 
I rather have a hole punch display or an under display camera
super random but I love how Marques will randomly slip a mention of Dbrand into every phone video
Okay but no 
same music as the iphone x 
and then literally every android out there will be copying the UI colour palette and design of it
 nice one  RocknRoll in Techtember  keep em coming 
One major con I see is the selfie camera getting covered in finger prints as people touch the Island cluster
Lol I deleted all the iPhone apps I always get rid of the apple extreme bloatware
LG palm recognize is a gimmick but this island thing is not
Watched on iPhone 7plus 
1403 everytime i do it makes me laugh
"Overall Im quite impressed by the 14 Pro More than I was expecting to be considering all the usual leaks prior to release Still Im going to wait for the 15 next year Why Because when it comes to the camera in my case anyway I use the telephoto a lot More even than the standard lens And next year theres the strong possibility of Apple finally incorporating a high magnification periscope optical zoom Which is right up my ally 

Also due to European regulations Apple is finally switching to USBC Which will make transferring RAW 48MP photos the quality of which from what Ive seen here seem far better than the standard 12MP JPEGs As well as usable transfer speeds for ProRes video which I also suspect next year could be bumped to 8K Not that video is really my thing Im far more into photography Still important upgrades expected for next year"
USB 20 lol
Ill buy one until they change to usb c
Dude thats so ugly Arguably uglierthan pixel 3 xl
I prefer 13 pro than the 14 pro
The Bee Movie is the best movie
Thats a really cool iPhone wallpaper Where can I get it
Im definitely not a fan of the eSIM It just makes everything harder to do for example if youre going abroad or you want to give one to your family youd have to get a special phone plan for it If that stretches out to the UK Im probably going to stick with the newest one with a SIM card tray until it gets made obsolete
Great video Wallpaper link 
This this the first time I seen a sponsor video in your clip why I pay not to see ads I will unsubscribe
Dynamic island is poor interface design intrusive on the screen with esim its a big no 
like always   apple and their innovation amazing stolen ideas 
Is the screen 120hz
As someone whos never owned an iPhone Im pretty tempted this time round Just have two problems the pricing  that most services are optimized for people living within the US
My wife has a 12pro max I hv 2 12 pro maxes  we are in  out but I think were going to wait on the 15 pro max

Thats a notifaction pannel wow
The home screan looks so 
I think the dynamic island is an overhyped gigantic punchhole wie animations AROUND it Its just nothing special but everyone on the Internet looses their mind about animations around a punchhole Huawei did something like this years ago I dont even get why everone does find it clever that they made it pillshaped Why  You can just make the pixels in between black through software and when you watch a video you can use them There is no advantage not to have pixels there
Clutch 
Now they cant change sims cops can find you anyware yay
You should upgrade your I phone just to feel the features Android users are having from a long ago
I sware people who use iphones have bad vision
honestly was shocked at how much better the 48 mp pro raw shot looked than the standard 12 mp shot Normally with smartphone cameras you dont see this massive jump in quality from sheer resolution because of the sensor size post processing etc but those 2 shots genuinely look like different phones
Trash
techburner asked you about that you already used unreleased iphone
ps given the sensor pixel array the camera is still 12megapixel and 48megapixel will not give you any sensible increase in details and sharpness
1856 no one even notice the villager sound
The day it gets released is the day the satelite falls down on someones house roof or maybe mine and yours Be cautious
does not having the physical sim tray means no dual sim capabilities
To me personally the true limit of the new camera is that they did not implement a 5x optical zoom This is only partially replaced by cropping a more detailed 48mp photo but it still lacks for all those that like me dont usually take photo of people
"VERY HOT INTRO 
Seriously I actually rewinded it maybe a dozen xs"

What does the s21 ultra record at Way more then 30 fps right
Dynamic island sounds like notch coping to me
nice information 
I dont really see the appeal of the dynamic island in android  The most hole punch style displays allow the front facing camera to blend in with the status bar  Apples solution still protrudes way further into the display
Where did that background come from
LMFAO THAT NOTCH
If Steve Jobs was alived he would be so much dissapointed and sad maybe died because of sadness again

Anyways great video sir fan from Philippines "
i wonder if the crash detection would go off if you were on a roller coaster
"Any issues I find with the Dynamic Island or anything else from the top of the screen is the reach required especially on the large phones

I find myself avoiding them because of the distance"
Its not easy to get the phone before it even gets announced and use it exclusively Just review it on YouTube and get maximum hits you are a lucky youtuber MKBHD atleast do some give aways to make us lucky too
DYNAMIC ISLAND BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA  HEY APPLE  WELCOME TO WHAT ANDROID HAS HAD FOR TEN YEARS   ALWAYS ON DISPLAY   OLD NEWS FOR US LOL  pathetic
Weather app animations opening and closing on locations  needs to be worked on 
Dynamic Island is interesting and cool but its in absolutely the worst place for the interaction portion to be
whats the widget on your phone the one with lots of dots
I wish I could have a Phone like this at least it flips its called a Nokia by the way
The dynamic island is even worse than the notch why cant they just hide it under the pixels like that other phone that has mastered it if it is possible why cant they do the same
If iPhone 14 pros camera is named island then the regular 14 notch is named peninsula
This thing is not innovative We can call it iPhone 13 facelift 
Marques14pro in your hands look like 14pro mini
Yellowish tint and such high contrast doesnt make it the best camera of any smartphone in my book and im sure many people will agree
Mk I really Wont mind if u gift me one 
What a waist of money
11 pro max is e best iPhone apple has made tbh
marquees is on Samsung payroll I am blocking this fucker
The transition in the beginning is just wow Words cannot describe the aesthetic feeling of this Absolutely incredible keep it up Marques
were moving on to under dispaly cameras and iphone is still making a gimmick out of its ugly notch
Do you have the full videos
So as an African who lives in the US can I use this 14 models with Esim when I go back to visit in Africa  I mean how can I use this Esim in Africa even if I buy the unlocked IPhone 14 pro max 
I am just gonna stick with my iPhone 13 Pro Max I dont personally need the 13S Pro Max lol

The only drawback I see with the dynamic island is smudging the front facing camera and constantly having to wipe before you take selfies
Who is responsible for all the smoke in the air in California
That Dynamic Island Is useless when you use phone whit one handon pro max
omg that doggo is sooo cute hes smiling for the camera too
Your personal opinion is not a review
Geometry dash made it in
There is zero speed upgrade from the 12 pro to the 12 pro It feels actually slower than the 12 I dont get it I hate it
Wow iPhone 15 looks really good 
Is the camera noticeably better than 13 pro max  Cos im getting 13 pro max much cheaper than 14 pro max should i go for 13 or 14
I want

Dynamic island is such a gimmick Mind blowing to me that is a marketing point Team android
Wait but split screening dual programs exists in Android already
Will be copied Hello LG V10 hahaha
Ayo Marques I stay 5 minutes from you question do you have any MacBooks or iMac you can do without My son is in the 8th grade and I wanna get him one but they are expensive let me know if you willing to part ways with anyPrice
I got a 12 pro max and Im not buying another iPhone till at least the 16 pro max They scammed me on 30 months of payments so I said F U I dont need a new phone just a new battery
Calling Dynamic Island will be known as DI
No its not all of us that have an iPhone hate the notch it is obvious that dynamic island is just a fake way to seemingly make the stupid notch disappear yet it is still there a lowercase i at the top of your screen It sucks even with digital trickery
That hoodie tho
"DIm youtuber 
   
    
Mere chanal se aapka help ho sakta hai
        
Nice video"
I love how marques keeps saying he wont say dynamic island again and then says it again like 5 minutes later
So basically the innovations apple talks about is heavily copied or influenced from others manufacturers But yeah they do it better than others 
Really wished it came with Touch ID
Apple finally has a new feature called always dim displays 
no finger print ID
Edit faster Im the fastest
Sorry for the dumb question can you use duel esim if you have two numbers
Shouldve been a S update
Still duel sim
The dynamic island baby what a terrible name
This time apple strategies is going to hit them back  like just upgrading a minor feature and rebranding it  thats not gonna work every time 
This will be my first iPhone in 5 years
The 11 was my first iPhone and this is my next one coming soon 
the fact that we cant arrange apps in iphone on our own sucks thats why android is better i saw this because i own both
Liked bc of the intro D not bc the gimmick DI 
Its so friendly and approachable I wish she was
"I have the 7 and i pre order the 14 pro
That a big update for me "
esim is a deal breaker
Bro can u make vdo bout Smsung s23Ultra
Why cant they just do invisible camera As a galaxy fold 4 user I love watching 4k videos with ZERO interference
Tbh the dynamic island isnt a feature that I would use that much Being at the top of the screen its pretty inconvenient
maybe Ip 14 pro just ip 13 pro with dinamyc island about always on display i love to keep my phone off or just display clock 
Wheres the fast charging and 120hz screen
As soon as my loan with my Iphone 12 is over Im buying the Iphone 14 Pro for sure Thanks for the video Marques 
Does the punch hole cut into 189 videos Looks like an excellent phone but I have a 13 Pro so Ill wait for the 15 pro or maybe even the 16 pro I hope they make all 3 cameras 48MP so we can get that crispiness in all focal lengths
"Smudging up the front facing camera when interacting with the DI 

Not something that I like but I dont use the front camera a ton so its not a huge deal but I can see it spinning the heads for the 16 yr old girls that apple like alls to target"

Its funny how I thought that apple finally came up with a feature of their own by introducing the Dynamic Island but nope that couldnt be further from the truth Apparently this ones copied from LG Ffs apple so much ingenuity
Noticeably rushed editing everything about this doesnt seem to meet the MKBHD standard youve set for years  The camera visible in the reflection of the first shot the dirt on the phone the text lists of the features in the Dynamic Island in Times New Roman with what looks like a copy paste off a forum post  I wasnt planning on buying this just wanted to see a comprehensive review of the features and hardware and Im surprised at the lack of quality  Anyways appreciate some of your takeaways for this generation
casually publicly states breaking an nda purrr
Mark ass brownlee
One of the issues I have with iPhones is a lot of their usage requires touching the top part of the screen Getting to the quick settings not being able to place the apps at the bottom of screen and now this island at the top Then unlike android you can only go back by swiping from one side of the screen which is not always convenient Apple needs to stop going for cool and think about the function but I guess cool sells better
We can always rely on mkbhd for the best intros 
The camera looks promising 
Coming from a IPhone X Im at a lost on what phone to upgrade tothe only reason Im upgrading is because my battery is going and if Im going to spend money on a new battery for that upgradebut Im lost between the 14 and 14pro even the 13 lol Im thinking of going HAM and going for the 14pro 
ESim for Australia as well
The Astrophotography feature is only a Software thing lets see if it will be implemented in ios17
Where can I get that iPhone wallpaper from
Can one expect a dealsale for the iPhone 14 or iPhone 14 pro unlocked during the Black Friday Sale in the US
Iphone 14 pro or max I currently have the 11 pro max and think its pretty big but i dont mind and im on my phone a good amount of time
308 may i know what brand case you using
MKBHD WHATS YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE LAST SECONDS OF THE EVENT Thinking its an Easter Egg  or Sneak Peek 
Chevron Oil supportersponsoed Nah Finding another YouTuber
Omg
I do not agree with you I looked the LG second screen and has nothing to do with the Dynamic Island
will they copy the notch bs or theyll keep trying to improve the under screen camera for a clean display
Hows your knee dude Is it the catches to ground falls causing it
You sir have good taste in music
I hope nobody copies this stupid trash huge cutout in the display design
Who after seeing this guy in tech burner vlog 
Currently watching this on my 14 pro max 256gb 
Not correctly rendering your skin tones should innit in itself make the camera worthless for a huge segment of the consumers Could be addressed through software updates But saying thats the best when it cant do that is reaching
Apple is so far behind Samsung phones
The dynamic island is just a fancy notification bar that can be updated on an iphone with and update
Me sitting here with a jailbroken 11 Pro Max on iOS 143 
We all wait for the line Dont get me wrong its not perfect 
Why do i feel these new features are towards doomsday
eSIM is a red flag
what is that lock screen wallpaper
Spotify rips artists off They pay far less in royalties than Google Tidal or Apple Music pay despite the fact they have so many more subscribers Total BS
Amazing vid Marques wondering if youre sticking to the smaller form factor this year or going back to the max
Re Astro photography  I was camping with a friend 6 hours from the city so it was pitch black at night We had a clear night and with my 12 Pro Max I was taking starfield shots wide angle camera so clear you could see the individual stars and the Milky Way Zooming in was a no  it quickly got grainy but at screen size it looked stunning My friend could not duplicate this even with Pro Mode on her Note 10
Aod is suck
Apple slowly becoming android
The quality  of your content has decreased a lot just going through apple presentation is not enough
"Can you prove how LG invented the dynamic Island before Apple 

Can you make a video showing the same exact thing"
No one tells about the Androids animations But when iPhone launch something like that wow thats amazing Andyes its very cool to have all the system integrated with the useless notch Good job again Apple
I assume its NOT an AOD its just an EXTRA DIM BRIGHTNESS look like like the one i have on my pixel
I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT I HAVE A THOUSAND DOLLAR HOLE IN MY POCKET BURNING AWAY HAHAHAH GREAT REVIEW AS ALWAYS
LG V10 has done it in almost similar way
Damn that intro 
Just picked up the iPhone 14 pro max today coming from the XR and I gotta say I love the 120 hertz display lol I will never be able to go back to 60
gonna smudge the ever loving crap out of the camera with that island crap
Its a total waste 
Dont you mean Apple copied others for the last few years 
Marques really showing off his 3 on Wordle well done 
The production value in that mother lovin INTRO
Apple stans looking like 
"Yes they did go to the USB C but they done it at the wrong end
Stafe Marc xxx"
What happens to dynamic island when i rotate the iphone 
Watching on my 14 pro 
When I updated the iOS 16 my battery life is like reduced 3040 faster than the previous operating system Apple needs to stop doing this of they be facing a lawsuit again
Would like to know whats the lock screen widget for the calendar thanks
i have a iphone 7 this is making me realize how old my phone is this is embarrassing
my 1st gen airpods do not activate the dynamic island  its the same pop up from the bottom once connected 
120 tho Obviously So 13 or higher
 that seagul sound got me bad
But whats the wallpaper tho Serious it looks amazing
Only thing Id mention is that the new cameras are much bigger than previous models It really does not sit flat on a table Got a case and its still lifted off the table Annoying
I only upgrade to 14 pro from 13 pro max iam sick of warking round with an anti aircraft missile to be fair there not much difference
"As for the ESim here over the pond lol no one well no service provider adopted it because I was told 1 Apples term  2 the price so they all said no thank you
Here we are always trying to get past racism  they make an iPhone thats different in each country are you sure Apple are not saying were different from you Or am I over thinking its 0225 im tired my dogs kept me up  im needed to help my daughter with my grandchildren as shes not allowed to lift anything  her mans gong fishing I wont comment on that by saying nothing says a lot sometimes doesnt it moving on im looking forward to it
Stafe Marc xxx"
Going from an XR so should be a pretty big upgrade to the 14 Pro 
Lol I just use iPhone to play so I dont know what to buy 13 Pro Max with better Fps or 14 with 60 fps
Im surprised you showed Dark Sky and didnt say anything about it being discontinued
Did they forget to apply the color correction at 1940
I dont know if that was intentional but he said connecting AirPods twice at 1103
Theres going to be a lot of false 911 calls
The Apple implementation of their version of an always on display will make more sense once they release Live Activities in 161  Also  I think the only way to test Crash Protection is to put an iPhone in a car when the IIHS tests the crashworthiness of a vehicle  MKBHD  you might want to talk with them it would be a great video
I see people saying tap should open widget and long press should open app No it is correct how it is now You all forgot how 3D touch used to behave Peek and Pop Thats how it behaves now for Dynamic Island too
Its a ripped off and it the same thing as iPhone 13  Dont buy it
I smashed the girl from Starbucks before work set off her accident detection
Can we get a comparison of Iphone 14 pro vs Iphone 13 pro
Anyone else shocked by the screen shot of a word document listing the dynamic island features It almost felt anti Mkbhd I would have expected a gorgeous floating font that fades in with each list of apps it works with Its only shocking because the quality of the videos is always soo high and everything is so crisp Also shocked it was a serif font
Iphone 16 No charging port Completely wireless  Every iPhone user omg thats amazing
Another excellent review I am eager to receive my new purple pro max
No brick 
It is just notch version 20 
should i upgrade from the 12 pro
What do yall think of the the new 16 update
Other countries are going esim also And its way easier to not get ripped off and you can get a plan before you go to some places Pros and Cons yes
Throwing the IPhone 13 was so not MKBHD that it was hilarious
I just live for the dog photos 
I have a 12 pro max  Wasnt crazy about upgrading but that dynamic island kinda sold me lol
1452 is it legal taking photos while youre driving 
Hole punch out
That Island is dope
522  the camera bump is just a little larger and the iPhone 13 pro case also holds the power button  So it doesnt fit quite right  It is really close but not really usable
I will stick with my 12 Pro Max and see what the 15 is going to offer
this editing is fire
All these top YouTubers are definitely on apples payroll None have said that this is not worth upgrading from the 13 or that getting a 13 or even a used phone is better value All these YouTubers only recommend new stuff
Will 13 Pro cases work with the 14 Pro
Am i missing something Why would you use cable to pull video from the Iphone would it not be better to just do it by wifi
Only thing stopping me from impulse buying is the lack of a SIM card tray
Finally something I wanted when Samsung released their pill shape camera Love the implementation
Im probably just gonna keep my Iphone xr for another year
I have an iPhone 6 which iPhone do you recommend me to upgrade to
just bought the iPhone 14 pro max its so lit
No mention about the thing I care most about Battery life
"Apple Introducing a revolutionary change Always on display
Nokia since 2002 Ha"
"Good video
Im waiting the S23 ultra
Team Samsung"
That doggie is so cute in the stabilization demo
Do frequently touching Dynamic island affect the camera getting fingerprints
That AOD is just not as cool as the androids I still prefer androids AOD
so if i were to theoretically import an iphone from japan or the eu or some other space and jailbreak it i could theoretically use a sim card
641 What are those widgets available when the screen is locked
I wish Apple would get USBC already I cant tell you how many delicate lightning charges are broken around my house
The lack of USB C is the biggest barrier in making the transition to an iPhone
mkbhd attitude in this video is really bad and low
Client of mine her in Australia picked one up No SIM card tray either he said so it not US only
One day you have hopes for humanity and the next you realize that it is not worth it when you find them equating the LG secondary display with the Dynamic Island 
Dynamic island creates a notch for this video on iPhone 14 pro On the YouTube app Its rather ugly and annoying Safari crops in a bit and looks better Just a note
I like some features for this new iPhone like new update for the camera pixels and dynamic island and car crash detection  I didnt like always on display though but when you think about it its just simple features were not talking about huge things that iPhone came up with so it doesnt deserve my money to buy it
This Will Be Copied This will be one of the most copied features vs  technically invented by LG How easily slapped the word copy multiple times on one side while carefully avoiding the word copy by any means on the other side
Crash detection what if ur on a roller coaster or Idk bumper cars but I dont think would be a problem just curios
I have the 14 Pro picked it up today and I have to be honest Im not impressed with the battery life I dont like the size of the Max but I may have to go for it
GIVE ME MATTE SIDES WITH THE BACK and I will switch to iOS again
"No TypeC USB 4 with TB
No WiFi 6E
No 2TB Storage
No 8K60 or 4K240 video

Only Pro thing about this phone is the name

When they do actually make a Pro phone to replace the iPad Pro for many people as a work device they will have to come up with a new name for the mid tier iPhones Probably it will be something du mb like Ultra   lol"
Your intro makes me believe that you could do official ads for pretty much any tech company
So no one is gonna talk about the port and transfer speeds
I Will be purchasing the Iphone 14 max it will be my second Iphone since the Iphone 4  10 Generation later
The always on display could use a lot more in customization I feel like the background is too bright Id like the clock text to be brighter but with black background Fortunately it should be easy to add in software updates
Where is USBC Seriously Apple is the worst when it comes to actual upgrades Its all about money
And this copied many Android UIs from many years ago
I honestly feel the camera cut out is aptly named as dynamic island I think of it more like a kitchen island than an actual piece of land surrounded by water So the cut out looks more like a kitchen island and since its size is dynamic dynamic island sounds pretty apt
I switch back and forth between my iPhone and android phone so with this eSim only version idk how thats going to work Guess Ill be keeping my 12
Is that a Tesla surf board
The DI
mkbhk u fool do you even mean what does dynamic means it perfect name as it is
"Would be interesting how the Punch out looks in Classic Invert mode via accessibility settings
 turning the dynamic island white"
You are my favourite YouTuber Keep it up
When MKBHD videos are better than manufacturers videos lol
Sometimes a FAKE is better just like the town of Chillingbourne
Whenever I hear about satellite modes from USbased reviewers it reminds me of how good their general coverage must be I live in Australia and it would be epic here So much of Australia has no coverage and I literally take expensive GPS beacons with me on big hikes just in case I cant wait to get satellite coverage here
Ah Mkbhds most viewed time frame September when the iPhone comes out Hahah
But will it dim the screen with 12min of usage in daylight  A very annoying feature theyve introduced couple of versions back
Love the intro song
I walked into a Verizon store earlier today and told them I wanted to pay full retail for a 14 Pro and use it with my prepay account They told me I couldnt Since when is this no longer possible
so its just the old edge display except more intrusive
Great review glad to have found your channel I subbed
Where did you get that nice calendar widget 
Dynamic island for stretching your thumb and ruining your selfie camera
You confirmed Jtspos
Couldnt care less about apple products but I still watch most of your videos anyways
is that a tesla surfboard
I dont really see the point of an always on display I know other phones have had it for a while but wonder if its actually useful
What aspect ratio are these videos in They always fit PERFECTLY on iPhone X and up screens by design Im sure
I have a iPhone 11 Im wondering is it worth updating to the iPhone 13 Pro Max or iPhone 14 pro max
I know theres less and more quality frames to edit with low FPS but why not be 60 cinematic
Over exposes people with dark skin  Built by white people always secretly made for white people
I think the SOS features will help a lot of people in danger and see it as a great move forward
The surfer board and the globe on the back thanks for always doing something like that haha and thanks for the video
Why does the Dynamic Island have to get bigger 80 of the time some people would only get the phone because theres not notch yet it goes to the size of a notch
I couldnt care less about the back camera at this point Im not filming a movie Im much more interested in a frontfacing camera that doesnt make me look like a potato
Would the island be more useful at the bottom Just curious on thoughts
Do you get the front camera dirty with all those taps
whats that calendar widget
full screen video playback looks horrible with this dynamic island 
Subtle wordle flex  
Man You sure know how to spice up basic features  why would anyone want a dynamic notch island Its just in the way Perfect op for Apple to get rid of the notch and they just made it worse Its a forever notification I tend to swipe all away why would I want a static one Camera is nice though they always are 
1446 why are those 34
Does the Iphone 14 have noise cancellation for cellular calls
Look at this graph 
talked about cameras but not the lidar is it imporoved any higher sample ratesmore data
"I hope you will reply this message for my glad and unforgettable person 

I am from india and I would like buy an iPhone on last 3 years 

From iphone 11 i am dreaming until I dont get  now 14 came i so sad for situation 

I hopping any if you can give me a give a way iphone then this is the movement my life ever"
Good lord that intro was top shelf
"Apple really needed better antennas for cell phone reception I had to switch from my iphone 11 to an Android phone as I was constantly struggling with connectivity 

Overall I think iPhone 14 is a huge disappointment Im sure it will sell like hot cakes But to put it in comparison its like a OnePlus 5T after six months of the  OnePlus 5 

And the pricing is crazy in India About 2030  higher than the US I recently read an article as how much percentage of a persons annual salary would it take to buy an iPhone For Americans it was around 1 for Indians it was close to 20 "
Kinda like the this new way of presentation Catches your attention alot due to the effects n the music played behind every new topic Kinda of a pro presentation to match the apple way
It already has been copied Apple copied LG they were the first to have a second screen LG really is immune to trends they didnt follow him they were the ones who set them wideangled cameras Quad HD displays bezelless screens yall can think LG cuz they were the pioneers of a lot of things which is what made them a badass company on the Forefront of inventing new features that everybody will love and ultimately is what helped lead to their undoing because they never stuck with any of them kind of like threw a bunch of s at the wall and see whats stuck but one thing I know is for audio there was nothing better or cameras were great software updates that made the V60 cameras absolutely amazing this is a totally different phone from when it first came out and sometimes when you dont follow theres a majority of people that wont even give you a chance how many people do you think when they find out the V60 only had a 1080 display and even bother to check it out
About the Dynamic Island I actually like that you have to hold a bit helps prevent accidental touches
24fps  smaller file sizes 30fps Pfffft
This is the most underwhelming and pathetic excuse of a new phone Its 999 an I phone 13 pro with a different notch design 
This is found so amazing 
The so called Dynamic island digs deeper into the middle of the screen than the notch compare by playing a YouTube video on full screen
Does the dynamic island disturb full screen game or the notch is hidden
I never liked the always on display I would rather the screen just be off till I need it  Not to mention unless the image moves around the screen the lit LEDS will dim over time in comparison to the rest of the display regardless of how good the panel is  Everything degrades in this world and displays are no exception  This is noticeable on a solid white or color background
Just call it what it isa money grab
Really isnt that different Since 5g or even the iPhone X has anyone noticed there isnt huge changes Like fr inflation crazy n you mf want 1000 after taxes  Hell nah
WTF apple in Europe 14 PRO from 1319 EUR 
Cgojeva the best way of doing this to the people you have ever done  your own way and 
I think the worst part of a lot of what reviewers like about the new iphone could have been done through software They could have just added a lot of these features via software
hmmm my question to Apple would be great all those camera improvements which I dont care about when are you gonna uprgrade calling  on your phonesor should I say on your cameras by now
Wow its almost like apple is getting ready to put an under display camera on the phone in a few years this is the first step
Could these new phones not be released every 2 yrs 15yr maybe This yearly release stuff seems like weak sauce I couldnt really tell the difference between 13  14 
mkbhd products are expensive and you dont know the quality so its very risky anyway good designs but im not buying
How does Dynamic Island work with one handed mode Curious to know
i dont even know what apple really do  always on display after 11 years ago  too late for A company that claims artificial intelligence and supernatural abilities
WTF I hope you can turn that crash feature off  Thats way too much data that no one needs on me thank you very much
bro got a deposit of 12500
I use my Iphone 13 as one of the cameras at Church to present our services on youtube If I were to get the Iphone 14 pro or pro max would there be enough of an upgrade in the camera to be noticeable  Thanks in advance for any help
I just wished they reduced the amount of black space between the camera  the face id sensors and the actual screen because that would make the new notch slimmer like when Samsung did that with the hole punch with the galaxy note 10 if Im not mistaken
If you cant get rid of the notch then make it more usable I think they did a great job making use of that real estate
the internals of the i14 pro make it look like it was made by NASA LOL
They are still the same price in the US over here in the UK theyre about 100 more expensive 
nostalgic song
sorry to break it to you but this feature not this smooth and cool has existed for like three years on many dual punch hole display devices under 200k
Should I buy an iPhone 14 Pro Max or wait for the 15 Pro Max with the possibility of USBC
xiaomi huawei oppos product manager stressing out right now
     
1k hole in your pocket burning away I dont think you know old sayings haha
whats the song played in the background at the time of intro
Knowing that I am not going to buy this because of low budget but still watching the video 
Ive got the Iphone14 pro Max I love it
"isnt it just an animated notification bar i dont get it it dosent seem that new

its just now got funky animations is permanently there for fast access which is nice and takes up more screen space luckily the iphones are huge so it dosent really matter that much"
dynamic island is just a taskbar why are you so impressed by it lmao
Does dynamic island show maps directions for google maps or is it just for apple maps
Even though so small the dynamic island is done very well and will be copied to the extreme
guys i like ice cream especially vanilla
duita anen amar jonno
Anyone know where I can find that wallpaper
First thing I think about is how much revenue you made from this video Ads 
Me desperately looking if theres any Easter egg in this video
baxel too thicc
342  does that also include unlocked versions
236  why not engage the services of a professional stuntman or a company that performs crash tests
Its a cash grab by apple
What is the song in this video I love it
I like the sustainability note you add Keep those in there
No SPenNo Memory Expansion Slot No IR BlasterOnly a 48mp Camera What  Boring
The notification is killing me Whether I do list or stack style theres always some older notifications you dont see h till you scrolled up and down Ughhhhh I wish notifications dont hide just keep it visible like last time  anyone else The new iOS 16 is 
Yeah but now the battery percentage is available on the battery itself again and thats my favorite thing 
this will be copied from an apple who copy almost all their features lmao
Dont like this new phone  Nothing exciting the purple color sucks
Please review honor 70 thank you
nice video bro
"I know Ill never have this phone at least not anytime soon however your videos are just incredible
Im glad that I am subscribed to you all these years
Have a good one Marques"
They use an old feature like always on display then call it innovation
Welcome to Sonyland No island needed However when they think they need an island at all its nice of Apple to do something about it All respect to them
Looks like an ios update to me
Weve had dynamic island on samsung for way too long Apple being apple just flipped the name and restricted it to the camera cutout
Welcome to smudges on your selfie camera 
Should I update from 8plus
If this was one of the new YouTubers they wouldnt have used the climbing on stairs example they would have rather said something about activity in bed
"MKBHD 
You become marketing manager of Apple
 Is this phone really worthyneed to buy in this world economic crisis  
Ans  No
 Is this phone actually have any useful features that really useful in daily life of general population  
Ans  No

So be honest Dont become Apple lapdog  You are better than that
Adios"
Ive got 5 new subscribers today  Subscribers Count  596  Im sooo happy
The way he dropped his newest iPhone like shit  i dont think i would do that even after a year i own it
"Idk how no one is talking about how useless the top of the screen is with a dynamic island Its the hardest place to reach and use on every phone that is already too big Its a new gimmick and apple so its perfect
Its a notification bar Like on every cellphone with a screen ever made"

Hater vibes
The dynamic island is probably the best gimmickfeature Ive seen on a smart phone
have you ever ridden that surfboard
I still prefer the bottom up push of the pixel phone to switch between apps
Im telling
the wallpaper pls
The dynamic island is just a status bar
"Apple is doing an excellent job with these updates in my opinion

iPhone is starting to be positioned as an extension of well being  not just health and fitness These new features are literal life savers Something you can live without but shouldnt"
"I remember when buying apple product felt like magic they seemed to be leaps and bounds ahead of anything else it used to feel like youve stumbled upon some advanced alien technology The last time I felt that was with the first iPad Pro 128 All the phones and products after that are so incredibly boring and unimaginative I cant help feel the magic has gone I mean what are all those apple workers actually doing in that big UFO building thing The drawing room must be full of such board uncreative suggestions like  urn lets make the camera a bit better or the battery could have an extra 30 mins  Oh and up the price for a phone that looks exactly the same as the previous 4 
Get some Magic back apple "
Where can I find this wallpaper
Dynamic island with always dirty front camera lol
I am so disappointed you skipped past battery life improvements if any over the A15 Bionic The newer 4nm chip is supposed to have longer life with the 20 boost in performance supposedly
Nice video name
Can I get that before it comes out
You are very biased for Apple
You could test the crash detection on the iphone or the apple watch by going on a roller coaster with it i wonder how it would react Just an idea
If Samsung come up with few features in new phone youd have ripped it off This is bias bullshit
For petes sake dont name the notch once you name it you get attached to it
Trying to relate the Mkbhd Easter Egg that globe behind in the video has got a message bubble that too indicating from an island Is it relatable to the feature Dynamic Island 
Now that iPhone has produce its product the esim 14 as the name implies internet phone and the real fusion of hardware and software das the dynamic island thanks for the review
you know what would have been a game changing feature Usb C
I honestly think that dinamic island is absolutely an good feature to me honestly and I really like it to be honest  Seems pretty innovative and good to use 
Nice wordle stats 
The pill actually looks much bigger than on the PowerPoints or in the videos Personally I found it more distracting than the notch Kinda regret trading my 13pro for it now
Welp that was fast
The increased brightness is useless iPhone 121314 get too hot and automatically force the brightness to 30 of maximum
New bhai nice watching videos
" l am youtuber
Mera ertugul gazi channel hai

5k geekbench score is in the gaming laptop performance territory As a Samsung S21 ultra user im pretty jealous of that and wish android could even get near But im loving the gestures and swipe from edge to do multiple things on android if someday iPhone has that Im definitely switching
No need for 8K 4K is more than enough
I waited for his review 
What are those lock screen widgets youve put 
Sarah Dietschy said that when she had it on her desk with always on display and not using it other than some notifications that came in she said that after 12 hours the battery was still at 100 and after 12 more hours it dropped to like 95  Thats pretty good This was with the 14 pro max
Selfies do look meh indeed
Great review BS phone  cheers to MKBHD
Lg v10 vibes slick no
I hope u killed that laternfly 1555 iPhone 14 lonely Island and a better camera pretty dope
Is it worth watching videos on youtube  anymore if the add is longer than the video itself
Ur ad is worse
Blah blah blah its same old 
Hi marques i hv iphone 7 plus that my mom gave me few years ago do u think i shud upgrade it to iphone 14 pro max  N if pro max is out then to pro max  Or flip 4 Thanks
Dont like the island its to high to reach with one hand and I really hate that it has a black background just looks like a huge notch again The always on  is still way worse than on any android theres no way to customize it
You guys are too smart to not know your paying for the exact same phone
"Why apple user compromise With each release
Expectations are 100 and you get 30
I dont understand
Basic features are monetize and no new innovations
Do you need satellite sms if you live in city
I dont think you will be like 
Oh my phone has satellite communications let get off grid and get lost in forest"
You need a reminder to floss
Aah RIP LG once again Still other companies today bringing out ideas that LG already presented many years back RIP LG you taught the industry so much
I really like the way you keep it very professional from the start to the end  I never ever had second thoughts about watching your videos
Where can I find that orangeblue wallpaper
i have a iphone 7 32 gb and is crashing and battery gets used in 1 hr is it worth upgradingsince im in australia its 1899 is it worth it or nah
The most shocking thing in this video was the revelation that the V10 is seven years old
Definitely Apple promotion that video introduction
Gotta give props to Apple they wait for the competition to test out most of their innovative new features before implementing them
This got the 8 plus so a upgrade is needed for me 
"Why LG died and Apple is thriving

Hi mate i have the iphone 13 pro max now do i have to switch to iphone 14 pro What do think  Im new with iphone anyway thats why i dont have an idea Hope u can help me decide
Thats just about the best Intro ive ever seen on a tech channel
My man is vexed
Thanks for summing up and reminding me why iPhones are so bad
See now this is how you review a phone  Thanks bro
what advantage does the island have over a notch its more in the way of the screen
Huawei had satelite conection with their Mate50 before Iphone came outjust saying
Your reviews are a treat to watch Analytic enough and with excellent presentation Good Job
1844  Where do we go to subscribe over there
holy shit that intro is amazing
Background
Watching this on my iPhone 7
My Apple Watch thinks Im swimming every time I blow dry my hair
Dynamic Island  Mind Blown
Please make iphone 14 plus review rather than regular 14
I finally realized why iOS is better than android Right as MKBHD was mentioning how many different AlwaysOn Displays he has seen over the years it occurred to me Apple makes their OSs for people who never ever EVER want to fiddle with ANY customization Emphasis on the word fiddle Some people see customization as a hassle that theyd rather not be bothered with
Youre not going to show us the comparison of the LGV 10 that invented dynamic island 7 years ago
Jermain cloe
I HONESTLY THINK THE DYNAMIC ISLAND IS JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THE SMALL MARKETING SCHEMS THAT apple does that works so well  even though there is still a notch this  this new features made it look New most people
Thats cutting edge tech fam
The different is nothing comapred to my 12 pro just notch is vanish And like usual bla bla new chip New resolution that we cant even differentiate using our naked eyes Same goes to cam that we cant see different at all We see like its different because our screen has been used for long time and our lens got scars
Feels like they left 13 and nonpro 14 customers out to dry here The dynamic island makes the notch WAY bigger than the iPhone 1314 notch to the point where it could be added to those two models 14 Pro exclusive Always On Display was also a big copout All you need for that feature is a lightprox sensor and accelerometer which have been in the iPhone since the 2007 1st gen Making software features exclusive to Flagship Flagship phones really shows theyre scraping the bottom of the barrel in terms of innovation
dont forget to floss
That causal Dbrand nod was kinda amazing ngl
"That crash detection could be an awesome and probably life saving feature for us bikers
Most biker accidents are solo accidents in the middle of nowhere and it might take some time if help arrives
Anyway my Note 10 is getting old its a 2019 phone and Im eyeing both Android and Apple now since Apple has made tons of improvements in the past few years to appeal to people like me
Maybe wait for S23Fold 5iPhone 15"
Talk about iPhone pricing in other countries 256GB 14 Pro costs Rs 139000 ie 1750
Marques your videos are incredible but for the love of all thats good can you PLEASE hire a photographer to take pics with these new devices   Looking at construction cones and gravel are very underwhelming especially to us creatives
Nice video but Apple is slacking on innovation Basically the same phone with some performance increase that are not noticeable on a daily basis Some software tweak that could have been implemented with an iOS update ahem dynamic island Quiet boring to be honest
Ah Think the best cameraphone would be Xiaomi 12 ultra
When you do star jumps it triggers the crash
Wow that pill design really is top user experience there As a user I want to relocate my thumb to open a background app lmao Its shit design It will be copied and it will die in a couple of years because its UI design coming from dumb hardware design not out of need
"Im PHILing the FiFT15N Pro Max 12G RAM 3TB

 Super Fast Charging  ish 
Wireless Power Share  ish
PHYSICAL SIM XR ROUND BEZELS in OD GREEN "
why low bitrate Worse quality
This is the collaboration I didnt know I needed Still looking and sounding as fantastic as when I saw you live in concert in Birmingham UK during the 90s
Excellent vid although I cant agree with you about the dynamic island Its presence alone annoys me
                
i still dont see a difference between i phone 12 and 14 
worst feature ever you need to reach top of your phone to use that
I know that in the grand scheme of the Apple iPhone ecosystem these are very small improvements However as I go from the iPhone SE to the iPhone 14 pro this will be an extremely different experience for me I plan on getting it in two weeks  im excited to experience a new level of iPhone Great video  MKBHD though  I love the honesty in your reviews
Camera will get smudgy if we click it several times with ur fingers Phptp quality can be affected imo
Can you please make an AirPods Pro 2 review
"i am youtuber   YouTuber  mera gamig chanal hai     mera chenal se apka halp ho sakta hai                                 
nice video"
I dont understand why they still just have 3x max optical zoom Why not 5x or 10x You know stuff thats noticeably different
Still no fingerprint unlock
The beginning was smooth  Love it
I really hate to say this but I am going Samsung Apple wants to much control Its like you do not own the apple products They are constantly making changes to things that was once free to make you continue to pay There are not many great features that can only come from Apple meaning all their updates or new phones you can now get elsewhere for less Do not get me wrong I have been when apple since the very first iPod  iPhone But back then when you buy the phone you owned it meaning no paying monthly to use the application on the devices To summarize apple is no longer and have not been leading in the technology industry for a while This is why they started charging to use so many applications an which comes with the device 
Idk about you guys but their implementation of AOD i find it just atrocius not hating or anything just saying what i feel about it
Dont you think is pathetic to have a 10YO Lightning port Usb 20 transfer speeds for 4K videos Doesnt make any senseBig mistake

It was rumor that iPhone14 will be a foldable phoneWHEN will Apple release a FOLDABLE phone after Galaxy Z Fold6  in iPhone14 there is no MAJOR hardware change same design as iPhone 13 except for smaller notch To keep it less talk of the town the software engineer has came with the brilliant idea Dynamic Island so less people can discuss the size of the front camera notch
Just wait until the iPhone folds  once again 45 years behind android
still no notification bar tho on that fing dynamic island
Honestly yes its gonna be copied and Im already annoyed and sad to those companies who do those type of thing
why dynamic island sounds so bad for you
Kill the bug in 1603 The Spotted Lantern is an invasive species that destroys our natural ecosystem
019 Shoutout to the editor 
SO TO PUT IT SIMPLE ITS NOT WORTH AN UPGRADE IF YOU HAVE 11 12 ITS NOT GROUNDBREAKING thanks mate
DYNAMIC ISLAND  TOUCH BAR so funny for 10 days after that forget this
I enjoy your videos be safe God bless
its already copied by apple from samsung s10 plus
This wont matter when the i phone has under display camara in 2026 mark my wordss
Simply put Iphone 14 pro front cam Racist 
Well I work with Telstra in Australia weve been having sim issues here for the pros 
60 Hertz
Im sorry but no one will copy that other systems have overcome the whole notch thing and moved on to punchhole designs etc or even invisible under the screen so no one outside the apple world will care for that huge notch with that softwaregimmicks
"Big fan of IPhone and always had IPhone but dont like the Dynamic Island It will just be like the 3D Touch that most people dont use or care iOS 1601 has been buggy for me my iPhone 14 pro shut down twice by itself while there is battery juice

Also just found out dont know if this is a faulty hardware with my IPhone 14 pro When I record a 4K 60fps video from 05x I cant go up to zoom in to 1x 2x or 3x 

Same thing happen when I record on 3x as a start I cant go down to 2x 1x and 05 Should I return it or is this iOS bug"
i get all these notifications as pop up on my screen and if i missed it it goes in a tiny symbol left on topand when i scroll down ill see al my missed thingsall on my Galaxy great job Apple very innovative
that iphone 14 camera tends to overexpose people with dark skin should trigger a petition
At first I followed Marcus on YouTube because I thought his reviews were great and unbiased but the more I start watching all his Apple reviews its kind of obvious or seems like hes being paid like all the other YouTube reviewers to only leave good reviews on their product Even on past Apple products when the phone is completely trash he still will not talk about the negatives who will always just boost it up and help Apple market it Its obvious that all Apple does is just change the color on their phone and give you a better camera every year and thats it Its pretty much a camera that makes phone calls I guess once you reach a certain level of Fame the money does change you
Great vid Making a lot of good points Im picking up my iPhone14 pro max tomorrow Currently got an iPhone 12 and skipped the 13 so nice little upgrade 
ham jehse chote youtobr ko bhai  Kamiyab bna do ham bhi itani mehent karte hi par koi Sport nhai karta 
everybody please admits that this always on display is a mess terrible concept from apple who wants to be always different from the others despite their late to the party  and dont even debate about dynamic island
MAGNIFICENT       
Im gonna get the 14 pro max but could care less for that island
He dropped the phone like it was nothing 
Will Always On Display feature come to iphone 13 on a future maybe update
Nope intellegent notch would bnnoying I hate notifications cluttering up my screen
haters forcing their  is just pathetic
The dynamic island is a software solution to a hardware problem Apple hasnt innovated for years In my opinion Samsung is trying much harder to create new technology
Bruh the samsung ads
Im planning on going out and touring Australasia and so the Emergency Satellite thing could potentially be a life saver
Your one click can change my whole life
Making money is an action Keeping money is behavior Growing money is knowledge
I just got my pro and the cameras are way too big
Great phone probably but Ill stick with my 11 pro max for yet another year Pricing in EU is getting insane 
If LG did this Dynamic Island you would have called it a Gimmick
Will iphone 13 models get always on display with software update
I would say 13 Pro Max still the best and more sensible to use now with ios16 in 13 pro max much better But i really need that 14 pro max camera 
The 14 pro max costs 1450 dollars in Europe  Its just a phone Jesus
   
Would you recommend upgrading to a 14 Pro from a 13 Pro
Not a good upgradewill wait next year 
"The question is should I change from a Samsung note 10 to an Apple iPhone 13 or 14
    What do yall think "
LG V10 did that top Notification bar 67 years ago i remember marquez reviewing and demoing that LG notification top bar
Its amazing how some features like Car crash detection seems so simple for people but I think this might have made the engineers and designers scratch their head to make it precise
Here I am saving to buy it after 5 years and he drops it like its not one of the most expensive phones available 
Same shit every year Marques is a corporate selling bitch Dont trust his reviews JUst get a phone in your budget theres nothing that this can do much better than other and ask for 1500 euro Thats a spit in people face Apple
How does the always on display deal with screen burn in Ive had issues with burn in on XS Max and other OLED displays
Is it worth to upgrade from iphone 11 base model to iphone 14 pro max
The way you throw the phone
207 guys marques is on bumble hahaa
Move aside IPhone 14 where can I get my hands on that surfboard 
So what do u really get thats new A slightly upgraded camera Slightly Upgraded display Slightly faster speeds Wait thats what EVERY new iPhone does They be reselling the SAME phone with SLIGHT upgrades and everyone just eats it up ITS JUST LIKE BUYING THE  SAME NEW JORDANS THAT KEEP DROPPING OVER AND OVER AGAIN WAKE TF UP PEOPLE
"As a long time Samsung buyer i have to take my hat off to that dynamic island thing 
Such a simple addition but SO effective Love it

That being said if you like taking selfies then youll probs smudge it"
MBs Intro  product
dude always on display is just obnoxious
Hello MKBHD are you experiencing ghost touch or lag in swapping on ios 16 I have just updated my iphone Xr to ios 16 and its lagging slow to touch response
 Apple literally cut the upper screen in half and call it dynamic island yeah imma book a flight and travel dynamically to Google Pixel 7 pro bye
Notch only developed nothing to see new one
"I will only upgrade my iphone 12 pro Max to future iphone when

1 There will be a type c charging port
2 Edge to edge screen"
eSIM is a deal breaker
"When you look deeper actually dynamic island interaction on daily basis making iphone notch even bigger than iphone 11 or 12 seriesso the point of having edge to edge screen is really a lost cause for isheeps

I believe iphone 13 notch is the best one ever for apple

I am sure after use of 1 week of DIsland people are gonna get bore eventually and will get frustrated after then because this is taking a lot of space on the upper part"
iPhone 15 will remove all buttons
POV you came here cuz this was number 2 on trending
Number 6 on trending dude you are the man 
I already liked the video 20 seconds in I dont think AOD is only on or off you can still customise a lot like adding widgets from weather and different apps that allows
Dynamic Island  Dirty Front Cam 
Just an fyi around 1115 or so you say connecting AirPods twice when you are listing the things that the island does Might wanna edit that one out 
hoping the next iphone would be a great improvement for now Ill pass
Where can i get the Wallpaper you use in this video please
Just brought it today as its now in UK upgraded from oneplus7t Im living a dream on this phone
"That island
Its not only hilarious that they dont remove the notch  but give it a name

Its also WORSE That half centimeter between the notch and the border they left  It gives no info  you cant really see shit in that half cm
So basically theyve  just removed even more screen space
They just made the notch bigger if you thing about it
Because that half cm wont give any image info 
So it might as well be considered part of the notch"
Hello call to Agar aapke Charanon se Hamari help ho rahi hai to kripya Jarur Karen aur aap sacche Dil Ke Insan ho to kripya help Jarur Karenge Varna Nahin Karenge comment box Mein Hamen Jarur bataen
That intro is just actual 
Wonder if something like bumper cars  or a rollercoaster ride would trigger crash detection 
For the car crash they said youd have to have driving mode on for it to trigger
Its looks the same and thick bezzels Ew
"Very sad that there is no customisation on the always on display I have a cutout of myself on my motorcycle on my always on display

Poco F3"
When Im riding my bike it ask my if Im cycling and I want to log the workout 
The transition into the ad
Hello I am YouTubebar mere channel se aapko help ho sakta hai  nice video 
Hello I am YouTubebar mere channel se aapko help ho sakta hai
Feels like he is the brand ambassador for apple 
With only e SIM available is there still the possibility to use 2 Sim Cards
Loved it with u explaining
That they still cant figure out how to moduleze the phones cameras so you can choose what kind of cameras you want Instead of three lenescameras with different angles you could have an astro lense with no filter a infrared and so on
It didnt fit in 13 pro phone case mate
I dont like iphone but i just order one 
A phone has to have a physical sim port
hi
Lol in the video there all these elaborate animations in the beginning for the phone And on 1115 you have a screenshot of a word document D Not really consistent P
        
308 may be u have a dbrand case on it and drop it on the floor  slick move there
Marques would the Apple branded 13 pro max silicone and leather cases fit the 14 pro max Thanks in advance
Oh look its the hole punch cutout from S10 Plus Only slightly larger and in the middle what an incredible innovation apple
Have they figured out how to put a pause on the video recording at
Hi Where did you find the wallpaper
Hey Marques A quick question Cant the builtin satellite feature be used for the satellite internet like Starlink in the future
                     
wow
worthless
"First of all  Dynamic Island is shit island that would disappear from the face of smartphone universe no other smart phone would copy this and i guarantee you Apply would lose it soon
Second of all  What a shit upgrade to iphone 13 I mean come on I cant believe the features that they brought in  the extreme cases and trying to sell them
Third  I find this review biased I Feel Marques goes easy on iphone reviews you are meant to be on the user side and not the vendors"
The Video is so well made Kudos to the Mkbhd and Team
Since Esim has been an option Travel has been easier for me because there are apps that let me buy tempory sims in any country
The quality of the video is incredible
           
eSIM only Apple again drops functionality and calls it a feature 
Hah my current iPhone is 10 so its time for an upgrade anyway  Just happens that I decided to upgrade this year 
Review for AirPods Pro please
No USB C grrrre
5S still da best doe Plays games good pics 
ordered it and coming today soo exciteddddd
If you had to compare the 12s Ultra camera vs the IPhone 14 Pro cameras which one would win 
I almost thought he was racist for a second
It would be great that if you could share your views on how the latest iOS on oldest still supported iPhone Like my 1st gen iPhone SE is still working fine and is currently supporting iOS 157
Apple way cette expression rsume parfaitement la vision qua Apple sur la faon de magnifier ou de perfectionner une fonction ou technologie dj existante  parfois depuis un certain temps  mais je minterroge sur le fait que personne ne relve que la dtection daccident existe depuis 2019 sur les Google Pixel  ma connaissance personne nen a parl sauf le site Clubic
Weirdest accidental trigger was with fall detection on my Watch while pheasant hunting A couple blasts of the shotgun and elevated heart rate chase IG down the birds had me calling ICE contacts and 911 
its still on the preorder how did you get it
Dynamic island leaks into your content more than the notch 
One of the most disappointing upgrades of iPhone in recent years I bought iphone 12 pm and 13 pm right after the order bank opens but i have zero interest in buying 14 pm
performance wise apples as has come to the point where they longer have to improve it even if they do what will you do with it they might have to start experimenting with gimmicks now
Even the car industry they copy each others
67M views OMG 
Can I just say I loved those transitions for the intro
Thx for this Love ur take on all things iPhones Well all things tech too Lol
Intros comeback
"Does anybody else want to acknowledge that sick intro From the theme song to that short vid 
Great as always MKBHD"
How can you say it has the best camera The Samsung s22 Ultra smashes this iPhones camerayou are biased as always towards Apple
I need that wallpaper it looks dope
Im highly upset that I had to see a spotted lanternfly in this video when I cant seem to escape them here in NJ Great video though
Only issue I have with the Dynamic Island is the fact that youll have to clean your camera all the time if youre touching it putting finger prints all over that area
apple is scam
whats your wallpaper called thou 
Im going to do 2 more years with my 11 pro max
The sunburn on his left wrist 
This intro is one of the craziest things Ive seen in a loooong time Its so beautiful It gives me chills 
LOL I only watched this to see if there has been any innovation with iPhonesand going to be honest half way in the video 11min and all I had Marques say so far is just like filler BS gibberish Yet again another iPhone that will be overpriced for absolutely no damn reason But consumers will just consume becauseconsumerism I dont know Loving my oneplus 9 pro 5g and oneplus 9 5g
Car crash detection Habibi watch chitralahari movie an Indian Telugu moviewe invented that far back
I dont think the names cheesy and the only reason Im getting a pro over the normal ones is because of the dynamic island
I miss LG level innovative stuff in phones these days
All the reviws so far have been silent about the magsafe did they scrap it off
I love how Apple sponsored this new chevron hoodie well worth the video to watch
People asking for multitasking and apple adds dynamic island 
Dynamic Island is NOT actually new Check out LG V10 released 2015  now whos the copy cat 
I think MKBHD HATES IPHONES
Do you work for Apple just wondering how your able to test  use the phones before their  available to the public
i wonder what if the phone didnt survive the crash how it gonna help unconscious us 
Looks the same as previous models
Wouldnt even buy this iphone lmao  Ill wait for the Samsung s23 ultra on steroid Like  said They are all the same 
"The dynamic island 
Will be a Smudges island after a while touching it for opening apps and everything"
and andrew said  oh i thought they wanted the clamp to be like hidden in  the back  1022
I feel removal of sim card slot is a move indicative of portless iPhone Hence not going to get type C iPhone Apple likes you to get locked in having just the Magsafe will help them achieve it
U should try mi 11x always on display transition its just amazing iPhone transition is nothing
Waiting for JerryRigEverything to teardown the 14 Pro Max
Lol yall really need to stop hyping up Apple with these lackluster updates Especially youthese features are all at least 2 gens behind and that island is completely ridiculous
MKBHD has the dopest intro for a Tech Channel for me
LG is the company who made all of concept that are being used by the companies
Time  to upgrade for this iPhone 14 Pro Max Bye bye iPhone X Max 
That intro transition of iphone 14 pro  text  from dynamic island was crazy creative 
Ive upgraded from the 12 mini to the 14 pro have I made a good choice
"Looks fine slurpeewell I got winnings also on ig selected but I cant recieve free shipping due to lack of budget life routineam gonna die omygosh
The 14 built in was great design its getting really apearance so dramatical bolder but yeah hard much to say alot as still very proud to apple many prayers"
 
The wide punchhole is so fkn ugly  they actually made it worse and more intrusive by lowering it like that
Amazing review man keep it up btw where can I get this wallpaper u had on ur phone 
That intro is a work of art
apples copies android so what is there to be copied
I have the iPhone XR and it has been working fine these past years still Honestly have been considering getting a new one but with how fast they have been updating these iPhones I might wait a little longer till there is a new considerable improvement
 their 
LG thats what I miss about them thinking outside the box and never following the fadtrend Its a damn shame they were never able to capitalize on the market
The metal banding around the phones has changed a bit
A phone that will call the police on you lol Good luck with that to all the dumb crooks
No one can beat Apple at this point no other company is even close to touching Apple level of phones
A16 is identical to A15 the camera takes no batter photo Apple is dead
Should I upgrade from XS MaxIll be saving 800 they say
Dynamic ilandfigerprints all over selfie camera stupid move from apple 
Please man can you share the wallpaper
Chevron hoodie is it available for India 
Apple should add clipboard to their keyboard
Iphone with an ipill for that wild night 
Didnt talk about battery
Definitely thought about my V10 when I saw the Dynamic Island still my favorite phone of all time Man that was a dope phone If LG did a rerelease just upgraded it I would get that phone so fast The V20 and every other V series was not the same as the original
       
that dynamic island seems disgusting if I wanted a notch I would at least want it to be the closer to the top as possible and the smaller possible just the camera like some samsung phones
video got compressed to hell in the first 30 seconds 
That intro 
my motorola from like 5 years ago has an always on display
Steve Jobs would be embarassed about these improvements
Bhai subscribe karo 2 minut mein Jadu dekhega
I pre ordered Upgrading from my iPhone X I also pre ordered
i was thinking of upgrading my iPhone 12 mini to the iPhone 14 pro in 512gb
Give a raise to your editor Marques Hes doing a dope job
astro photography is going to be the new selling point of 15 mark my words
Moral of this video Android already did it Iphone just did it better As an Android user I can respect that 
Where can I get your dope wallpaper Yo
The Space Black looks so good Dynamic Island coming to iPad Pro and MacBook Pro in the near future
i feel this dynamic island will be smudgeiest part of the iphone screen and this will hinder the camera front the most
Next year for sure the so called dynamic island will be slimmer than this year which theyre already capable of doing it this year but they wont its a market strategy And with the new 48mp theyll add vdo recording capability next year Theyre all capable of doing anything new features already but they place it slowly to make it seems they add new things each year
"I could easily be misspeaking here but hearing the upgradesit sounds like iPhone 14 pro is to Apple what the Pixel 6 pro is to Google more or less At least camera wise Finally upgrading from the 12MP main camera lens to 48MP New screen They finally have a hole punch camera albeit better implementation tho nabbed from LG Action recording mode  similar to action pan mode Cinematic mode Its like Ive heard this all before deja Vu Again maybe overthinking here but still

Make no mistake the 6 pro got crapped on in reviews but still pulled a 360 increase in their market sharegranted they barely had much of a share but that doesnt seem to have gone unnoticed"
Opening scenes 
Is your Knee okay
What about how dirty the front cam will get with all the touching in the dynamic island
Using my 14 pro now dynamic island is great and I disagree with the music function much prefer the single press to jump into the full application and long press for the widget
Over sharpening is still HORRIBLE especially in video WE NEED an option to reduce the ULTRA SHARPENING that ruins the footage And keep in mind that YouTube compresses and smooths things out
Mi canal de confianza solo que ltimamente escaso de tiempo
Live Notch wouldve been a much better name than Dynamic island
Im just curious why iphones today doesnt have under display fingerprint sensor
Its time to get right with Jesus You arent going to automatically enter heaven if youve lied or stolen or had sex before marriage dont be deceived The punishment of sin is Hell fire and we are all guilty of sin We are guilty before God and need forgiveness Call upon the name of Jesus and follow him Pray and ask him to help you repent of your sins He died so you could have everlasting life with your sins dealt with justly He bore the punishment You must know him today You may not have another day
I wanted to know after lasic any side effect or any maintanance that needs to be done
The iPhone 14 Pro max 256gb price in  Id 2099 which sucks compared with what youre paying 
This time MKBDH got his video edited on fivver for 2 XD
Satellite connectivity should honestly be a feature on all future phones FOR FREE
Great video I am still struggling between the iPhone 14 Plus bigger display and best battery performance VS the iPhone 14 Pro new userinterface and better camera  HELP p
omg 
"Me ak youtuber hu
Ami akta youtuber  
Ham ak youtuber 
Mera chenel se apka help hosaktehe"
but it will left your front camera dirty
"Ive been an Apple customer for so long kept moving and upgrading my iPhones once every 23 years but these past two years the i13  i14 is the worst iPhone part ever
What the heck is Dynamic Island No need for a useless marketing scheme that is still useless Too far away from FlagShip phones out there
No fingerprint scanner no full display no typeC charging port and no innovations 

I do understand that a new camera and faster processor are important but lets be honest this is not Apple Bring back that hunger for new technological improvements and innovations
Think different be different"
Is it just me or is the intro just fire
Jokes on you I shoot 25fps
Mark ass brown lee
"Thank you guys Im very proud Korean We have Samsung LG Hyundai  Kia BTS BlackPink etc 

But your poor country never can do this 
Thank you for consuming our brands"
1300 ah there we go the cons of dynamic island you need to clean your front camera more
Fingerprints on camera 
Referring to the title I hope not but I do see Android putting all notifications in there
"I have mixed feelings about the dynamic island Im an android user Im used to having that info just from the pull down memu or existing widgets Im not sure if i would like to hang that big cylinder hole punch on the top center covering my videos in full screen I would have rather they made it like the LG V10 instead
On the other hand it does look cool how it interactive it is Animations on it look sweet"
Im a PT let me rehab your knee
These intros are fire
"1  Hv  
Thomas the train"
You said connecting airpods twice lol
I have the XR 64 GB for the past 3 12 yrs so yes going to upgrade 
Sometimes when I honk the horn in my car hitting it hard Apple Watch thinks I fell
the intro is actually better than the whole iphone 14 commercial lol
Does the Dynamic Island move down when you wipe the bottom of the screen for reachability
So wait The SIM card is the same size right
"120 Hz copied
Notch copied
Punch hole copied
Amoled display copied
Whats next to be copied"
Im waiting for iPhone 16 Pro 2TB
Whats the point of the island when you can probably do the same thing with a screen
The way he dropped the phone 
coming from an iphone X from Nov 2017 this would be a huuge upgrade for me i cant friggin WAIT my iphone 14 pro comes in tmrw 
No words 
People are already talking about iPhone 15
Conclusion Dynamic Island is the seller this year
"regarding  the island
1 Does this mean the notch is here to stay"
"When you support someone from start and than u
See him on this stage Really feeling proud of you too
Guys need all of your support "
the alwayson display might also prevent grabbing the wrong phone if not using a dbrand case 
Notch is better than dynamic island 
66 million my God
Its often better to go second Nobody remembers the LG V10
is it worth it to switch iphone 12 to 14 
Im just waiting for the s22 ultra vs Iphone 14 pro max cus Im buying either of them
Imupset they are hiding a hole punch due to samsung doing it first
The pill notification is same as Samsung notification Samsung has it without pill tho
im sorry thats the best intro ive ever seen holey moley
i am considering getting the 14 pro because my phone is cracked badly both on the front and back but i dont know im due for an upgrade so im definitely considering
"Ma is God
Who are like 
"
I respect every one who were involved in this seriously the best piece of even seen on YouTube hat off to well all i love your video
oh my goodness is that the battery percentage i see NOT on the pull down menu
"When you support someone from start and than u
See him on this stage Really feeling proud of you
Guys need all of your support "
"I pray whoever reads this right now may you get everything you wish 

"
I hate the new notifications on the bottom of the screen I find myself accidentally opening notifications more often
Apple is paying you well to help them sell the same garbage every year
What happens if one is in a crash the person is okay but the phone flies and breaks on impact
No SIM tray is not good Travel became not possible with this phone
I personally think Apple should have jus called it Siri instead of Dynamic Island Cus if you think about it its basically an assistant to your iphone always there with the helpful info 
Iphones are the nba 2k in cellphones They give an almost the same thing every year
What will happen to Dynamic Island when apple will switch to complete under display camera  sensor for face ID
Will touching the dynamic island smudge the front camera
and you just know that next years Pro will be USBC 8K and 3 lenses with 48mpx
1850 Cinematic Mode already supported 1080p30fps IIRC support for 4k24fps is whats new and they specifically called out 24fps as the filmmaking standard during the event 
Got this for the camera and also time to say goodbye to my XR 
What the fuck is that camera cut out on the front screen
Do you iPhone 14 pro back cameras is bigger than iPhone 13 Pro
SUPER HIGH QUALITY WHTAT THE WITH THAT INTRO
YESSSS I LVOE THAT U BROUGHT THIS SONG BACK FOR INTROOOOOOOOOOO
where pixel fans at sniff
Youre in jersey
Did anyone catch the connecting air pods x2 while he described the dynamic island
great review loved you in stranger things
Nothing to do with the video but why the hell did I need to watch 3 un skipable ads
Mark 1616 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved but whoever does not believe will be condemned
NO TO ESIM
The way apple did always on display is dumb
Still love the use of ALLTTA
Did you openly and publicly admitted that you broke the NDA XDD
I dont think you like Apple products at all bro
I ordered iPhone 14 pro max but going to send it back and just keep my iPhone 13 pro max its the same thing almost 
I dont think I would like the always on display as much as I like The only thing I really need to look at is the time I dont need to see my wallpaper or anything its more of a dim screen rather than a off screen showing needed information
Whats the widget called to the left on your lockscreen
The part where he said Dynamic Island baby what a terrible name  and there was seagulls music in the bg got me 
an overpriced crapple product that doesnt have anything new
So why you gotta go to Knee TP
The task bar on samsung is much more useful
Is that the standard wallpaper on the iPhone or an MKBHD exclusive
The copied iPhones 11 4g to 12 5g to 13 to 14 new interiors 
perfect example of Apple copying again now with this Dynamic Aisland feature I remember perfectly something like this on a LG phone 5 years ago LOL
just needed one thing to be perfect USBC
This will be appled
People used to android really seem to think that Apple wants people to buy a new iphone every year despite iphones being the longest supported smartphones in the market I rocked my iPhone 4 2010 until 2017 and then used an iPhone 6s 2015 until last year Like I genuinely dont know what more these people expect from these phones They slowly upgrade them over the years and youre supposed to replace your own every 5 years or more Have an iPhone Xs from 2018 Dont upgrade i If Apple wanted you to replace it they wouldnt upgrade it to iOS16 would they
Are they making dynamic peninsular for iPhone 12 and 13
1900 I think you meant 24 FPS coz it already supported 30 FPS last year
Bro rlly got it before me smh
How come they havent decided to transition us into VR yet lol seems like they lost their only creative leader lmfao
535 Notice how they put the cameramic notification in the space between the pill and the hole So those leaks saying it was going to be an  i  coutout were true except Apple covered it up with software
Apple giving a name to the notch means this will stay for years on iphonemaybe its time to try out other phones
Im very disappointed at the fact that theres no unboxing video 
Im very disappointed at the fact that I cant watch this video offline 
Dynamic island  boys emoji needed
Bro is an apple fan boy
Samsung s22 ultra is why better then Apple I am never going but Apple again
Why is nobody talking more about the satellite features Thats the coolest and potentially most useful feature a normal smartphone has had in quite a few years
Another rip off is out
Same shit Different package
Meanwhile I disable all animations on all my Android phones everyone will get over the animations after playing with the phone for 30 minutes  As far as app switching on Android double tap the Recent button to toggle between apps
Shoutout to the LG V10 I really enjoyed that phone Wish I still had it Let one of my friends have that phone after I got a new one Thing hit beyond its years
I m so happy to orden the galaxy fold 4
They couldve called it Dynali instead
PLEASE tell me WHAT app is this calendar on your Lock Screen
Hope everyone who records fights has an iphone 14 pro and uses Action Mode
"Camera question did they fix the lens reflection issue where lights and bright objects tend to have ghost versions or abnormally bad lens flare I see that on the 12m and while it can make for some neat shots sometimes it also makes taking a photo of anything bright incredibly annoying 
Also nitpick on the sensor crop zoom Id argue thats not optical zoom at all Its literally the definition of digital zoomcropping into the image rather than changing what is hitting the sensor Its better zoom for sure since youre still getting an actual 12MP image rather than upscaling but its very much still digital zoom"
MKBHD is extremely objective such nice

Ahhh I remember the lg v10 One of the last phones with removable battery
Me coming from the 8 plus red edition yeah im most likely get it Even thoe i still wished they made a pro red would be a super cop But i know they aint doing it I know it be a upgrade for me
"It is impressive how apple takes a disadvantage as the notch and make it a competitive advantage 
But they didnt rush to change it  right away as many brands did they just took their time and really they are starting to hear the consumers "
I remember the moto x came up with the always on display first
As innovative as it is the Dynamic Island sounds like an idea of an enthusiastic intern at apple that somehow convinced the people in charge to develop it into the new flagship model
prefer xiaomi
Copping that hoodie
your hair seems colourful or is it the camera you used Anyway I really like your videos keeps giving us more tech talk things
I thought 30fps cinematic mode was already on iPhone 13
I always wonder if Steve Job was alive will iphone be the same as today or more innovated
Okay
915  he got the battery  and a visual representation of that amount in the battery icon  HOW
Who also heard the seagull sound when he mentioned the dynamic island at 0846
Does touching the selfie camera affect photo quality
Theres always an LG phone that did it first
Paying over 1200 for a phone more money than sense a 150 to 200 phone would do anyone 
What do you guys think if the iPhone supports Apple Pencil
Fanboy gonna fanboy
Would wouldve impressed me is if they made the phone screen bigger
copping this
I dont like always on display because I like to turn my phone on and see the notifications cool feeling
I mean the Google pixel has had car crash detection and I dont think anyone has had issues with it
Wicked awesome hoodie
How much you get paid to mindlessly sell this stuff Seriously testing thats what you call it It is a paid review to sell stuff to people that they dont need Literally just a giant scam
Hocus Pocus 
anyone know name of the intro song
Your good content always get copied you should charge them 100 ever minute
And guess what Haptic feedback when typing a letter  on year 2022
I prefer android always on display its more interesting  fun with the customisation it make the users creative The iPhone just makes it boring and dumb
Kill the Spotted Lanternfly at 1600 Theyre invasive
308 I didnt see that coming Dropping a thousand dollar phone like its nothing
I agree Not worth upgrading plus its still damn expensive Hes right when he says if you have extra money to burn these days then spend it away
I would honestly still buy it 
How does it do with reachability
Wow that intro
dynamic island is cringe
Way to go out on a limb there 100 of smartphone ingenuity gets freaking copied Bold prediction sir
 gimmicky trash
My thing is how the battery  life with this always on display
"Hello guys we are going to review the iPhone 14 it has
99 of people shut up and take my money"
Mines coming soon Im so excited big upgrade
Gourmet status bar
They just sold us a much worse pull down notification bar with less options but they made it look fancy so people buying it up This cutout also just takes as much or more space than the previous notch just more proof they did it to make it seem like a worthy upgrade
wanting to do my own ambient soft and am having an issue finding a soft witNice tutorialn the program wNice tutorialch works for the MAIN soft Im
is there a way to downgrade back to ios 15  i made a mistake by updating my phone to this
Surprisingly you didnt mention watching videos with the Dynamic Island staring at you Plus tapping on it would add fingerprints which may affect taking selfies 
Can we get this hoodie shipped to the UK
Oh my goodness Cant believe I hadnt checked out his online store all these years Bout to get that desk pad Apple Watch band AAAAAND
How does the camera quality of the 12s ultra fares agains the iphone 14 pro series The ip14 pros camera sensor is larger than usual for smartphones with the benefit of the photonic enginge should offset the hardware advantage of the 12s ultra I wonder how does that translate in real life
I got them free beats rn 
I need that hoodie in XXS
Br9 this is so cool
But what about the new Nokia 5710 XA with builtin wireless earbuds
Shame about the sim tray removal I used to buy my iPhones in the States as its cheaper along with a sim for travel  so wont be able to do that Will buy in Europe
Bro can you post the Lock Screen you were using please
1813 Nice Tan line Marques
Wallpaper is 
Iphone 11 pro max owner here Cant afford to upgrade And still miss my iphone 8 plus especially the camera
Excellent review as always Im not sure I would agree the eSIM only architecture is limiting for international travel I recently had to do some research for a nontechnical friend who was planning international travel and I found a broad array of companies that offered eSIMs for most markets You buy before leaving and get a QR code Then when connected to the Internet via WiFi at your destination country you scan the code and it programs the eSIM and youre up and running fairly quickly
64 million views in 1 day Must be big interest for this phone Why should i buy my first iphone My previous phones its like 56 different samsungs 23 different Sony Ericssons  2 HTC phones 34 nokia phones but i never had a Iphone and i dont know anyone who own Iphone Why Please tell me
Meh
Car crash a feature Pixel already had glad to see Apple finally get it hopefully next they will steal Pixel call screen feature next  Finally Apple have always on display Glad to see Apple trying to keep up with Android features lol 
mkbhd what phone do u use and why
Who else is piss still no split screen multitasking
1420 Nothing like hearing the Boston come out in MKBHD when ever he says 40 
Apple needs to double their specs Way behind the rest
"Man this notch is really ugly copy what its just software simple notification  
For screen and overall design samsung is far far a way "
Why would you show the wordle of the day Smh
My pixel 6 pro has triggered that when I was running with it in my hand almost called the police scared the crap out of me lol
The always on display from apple is brighter than the brightness i use my phone usuall and wastes more energy since it lacks black
I wonder what a mate black iPhone would look like
Iphone has got weird if not stupid ideas and they support that idea like no its the apple way
wow bon iver bonnie rait cover intro song
Finger print nitemare for selfie camera
So if you have an XS should you still wait
Is anyone upgrading from iPhone 11 Pro to 14 pro
To each his own but I simply can not understand the hype and crazy devotion to a company that brings out really really old techfeatures uses marketing buzzwords and people literally view them as revolutionary new things
Hoodie season  Thats February in Tampa  For 5 days
I simply wanted the previous notch to be made smaller I dont like that the notch was lowered
Samsung Galaxy Fold 4 the best
"I like Google pixel series over iPhone The amount of new features and improvements at a fairly good price is good Samsung and Google pixel are better phones than iPhone
Iphones old shit at even higher prices with every new release is dumb"
I was a huge LG V series fan and I was like tghats the v10 look babe 7 years ago
"This will be copied Yeah Since Apple has copied the dynamic island car crash detection AOD and much more from other manufactures and just redesiged it to fit their phones thats really true Dont forget that ie the Pixel phones have had crash detection for years aleready

But how did they fail worh such a basic thing as the AOD Most of this defeats the purpose of a AOD And with tons less options than the first AOD ever on a phone it is really sad"
Watching MKBHD is entertaining
Not having that sim tray is a huge deterrent because there are many countries and carriers internationally that havent switched over to eSIM It limits the availability to choose carriers for cheaper alternative options for data Youre now faced with high roaming charges Apple also lost out on a significant amount of sales from those in the international market who were considering getting the iPhone 14 pro from the US market What about their authorized resellers in these international markets who receive products from the US market
The only thing positive here is that you are listening to kanye west still
I feel people should try to keep their hands on the 13 pro if they have one 14 pro really isnt any form of upgrade in the slightest
I hope there is an option to make the AOD all black background seeing the wallpapers is not necessary at all we only need to see the time and notifications when we have a peek in the bed apple only did that to make it seem different from the others that is the only reason
Bruh whyd you have to tell the people we copied another android feature Lost my bragging rights now
If you get into a bad crash then your phone will most likely go flying out of the phone holder or wherever you keep it apart from obvious pockets Im guessing if the phone is totaled then it will still work and call EMS right
Upgrading from my SE2020 to 14 pro max Cant wait
Im amazed that so many people are excited to see a massive notch taking up a ton their screen and thinking oh now that its dynamic its awesome
The camera upgrade looks very promising Would have upgraded if it came with USB C instead of lightning Fingers crossed for next year
bro that watch tan haha
MKBHD a confirmed J cole fan lets go
Coming from using android considering an iPhone just to get quicker airdrop to my Mac this phone seems super gimmicky Basically no change just adding features that android had years ago and much heavier
If you have an iPhone 10 or before the 14 is the perfect phone for you Its actually pretty innovative design wise If you have a 11 pro any 12 any 13 then theres no reason to upgrade as its not worth it unless you somehow have a fully degraded phone that went through hell and barely works
I just want to know what exactly happens to Dynamic Island while timersmusic active in it when accessing Reachability
Whats that binary clock widget from the thumbnail
upgrading from my iPhone 11 pro max
the most real ive ever seen you regarding iphone
we need an updated whats on my iphone
305 the way i jumped when you dropped the phone on the floor omg
Woah I had no idea Apples using black pixels in the notch It would be really cool to see if someone could force it to turn on
Hey Marquez not sure if this was asked already but I dont have time to look through 15000 comments so at 136 of the video you have a calendar widget on your lock screen who makes that It looks like the days you have appts are highlighted Thanks
Meh its a iPhone
No SIM card Nah Im good unless theres a global version
Ill keep my 13 Pro Max 1TB Alpine Green  love the color of this phone I still have apple care for another 20 months so maybe the iPhone 15 or 16 Ill upgrade but have to have a green color I want to upgrade my series 4 Watch stainless steel to the Apple Watch Ultra but wish they had another color like space black Scared to order one and later they come out with a new color  Also the series 8 watch stainless steel space black 1400 for that color but the other 3 colors 750 I dont get it
Am I the only one that got distracted by that black dot on Marquess finger 
Im not sold on the phone but Im able to upgrade my old phone with this new one through ATT Ill just do that and wait for Christmas
Really want an iPhone running Android God that would be awesome
thats a crazy cool transition for the intro
Here in Germany you have to pay 1449 for the smallest version 128GB of the 14Pro Max This is insane
Apple can keep their myopic island Ppl just want to make it a big deal so they can grift others into buying it and then their stuck in Apples  Walled Garden
Same old same old iPhone 13 the cell phone technology has reached its limit
LG V10 got a shout out IMO one of the best looking phones ever Loved the swappable batteries 5 battery life to 100 in seconds D
The people that buy the iPhone 14 are the ones that are vaxed and also drink diet sodas
In 2030 Apple says the future  iphone than we make have the USB typec and nobody do this like us 25 years later Hahaha they are really boring Im sorry Apple your company from the other century
Every year new iPhone and every year emotional damage 
Did MKBHD just admit to violating his NDA by confessing he used the phone in public before its release
So the same phone like 11 buy now whit amazing and  a BiG Notch Hahaha Really apple  Always on display in 202223  I think apple doesnt do anything new in 10 years android win the game again
Good luck with the smudges on the selfie camera 
My man Bon Iver in the intro
That front camera will all the greasy fingers touching it
Should i upgrade to 14 pro max from 13 pro max 
MKBHD has a lot of high profile contacts So just wondering when will we get the Jeff Bezos interview
hey guys im confused in iphone 14 pro 256 gb   iphone 14 pro max 128 gb as i have limited  budget  Please give your views 
That 48mp ProRaw zoom looks fing insane Lightroom editing is about to be the same on an iphone and a camera
"1605 anyone know what those 2 buildings are on the left hand side 

Thanks"
Its just my opinion but I dont think phones have any business doing 8K video Even 4K will suck up storage on a phone like nobodys business very quick  Still 8K isnt even practical at this point in time A somewhat decent 8K display costs over 4000 Mainstream use of it is still a ways off
I LOVE the hoodie but why is it 65
whats your calendar widget on your lock screen 
The best review of the Iphone 14 pro Well done 
Will need to clean the selfie camera everytime thanks to dynamic island Fingerprint  fingerprint
Thing is with astrophotography it will be another typical apple move Theyll do it down the line but in the apple way
So what hes saying is that for double the price I can get the amazon hoodie but with the mkbhd logo on the sleeve Yeah take my money you got me I need it
The dynamic island is pretty slick not ground breaking but just something to add more brand identity to the iPhone I like it were not getting rid of the notch were gonna make it do stuff
People spend thousands on a phone but they dont have 100 to spend on personal development
dont fix phones yourself
Once again another goated intro
Great review but does it have a fart detector
"Best overall Smartphone Camera  Really  What about 
1Over exposed skies in the background destroys all detail
2Video excellent during the day and bombarded with terrible lens flare dots that bounce and jolt around 
3Pictures You mean like the ones with still far worse dynamic range and lens flares in some photos 
4Far worse zoom which is a big deal 

Really If the android had these issues youd bury it a grave insult the company greatly and say its pathetic for a flagship 
But since its apple you overlook it all Pathetic"
Couldnt find the Easter egg on the background this time
What is really happening is Apple is driving people away from the standard phones I see the standard phone getting less and less updates year to year and may only be updated every 2 to 3 years The Pro models is where Apple makes its money If you want updates you have to buy the Pro
cmon suckers pay 1000 for a dinamic island and always on display aahahahah which other manufacturers have forever ahahaha
missed opportunity to show the LG that apple copied probably why you only got wait 6M views nm
The satellite feature is bigger than you think There are many apps that can use that satellite for wilderness tracking
Did anyone notice the fingerprint magnet on the front of the screen Oh thats a camera sorry O
"Nah Apple stopped being innovative a while back 
Samsung falling behind too  Their foldable are a joke compared to what their competitors in China"
Switched to Android for 4 years not missing iOS one single time Newest fold 4 with deals in New Zealand is cheaper than the iphone 14 pro max which are selling features existing on Android phones many years ago
Your review is always great But you should criticize how Apple in the name of some Software Upgradation like Dynamic Island Always on Display selling new phones with old features and design with a high price tag Because your words matter to the tech company  If you really mention it they will be alarmed that there strategy wont work in the near future
Crikey that intro
"Hello Humans
Strive not to be a success but rather to be of value Albert Einstein

Bro flexed a 125k wire transfer on us
"Bad product for fraudsters
FBI can track them easily
Also privacy sucks All time tracking you"
am I the only one who just straight up doesnt care THAT much about the camera infinate battery life or anything along those lines is WAY more apealing to me
in the past I tried to implement crash detection with iPhone and found that detecting crash by comparing delta in accelarometer and gyroscope readings was very hard Simple approaches like if the delta between readings the last 2 seconds is greater than 5x can easily lead to false positive Im gonna guess apple needed better sensors and ML model to really detect true crash Assuming its using ML model a simple drop shouldnt trigger it Youd probably need to throw it really hard at a wall to trigger false positive
Drop the 14 Pro wallpaper
48mp Damn wish they wouldve done that for the 13Pro  wouldve been nice
Just here for the Wordle Flex  seriously got ALPHA in 3 guesses Squeaked it in 6
Same crap more money
I guess you really tried hard not to say the always on display by apple is pure shit but We can read between the lines What a waste of work And bring back my animated wallpapers
Love that intro man
In a previous video you already swore This is the last time I ever have to say the word Dynamic Island out loud I knew it wouldnt last
Of course copied and pasted to make the iphone 15 pro max
Just ordered mine Cant wait to get it First time I ever got the latest phone as soon as it is released
It supports 4K  30fps instead of 1080p  30fps
With new pill Apple decreased screen space even more so I do n9t know if this is useful
One of the best thing was the Satellite SOS feature I dont like the esim only model at all
Samsung did always on display much better i love the island feature on this phone But well very soon see this island in other OS
Wow you just ruined the Jerry Rigs upcoming video by saying the things u did at end
Flight of stairs 
one thing i notice is my favorite J  cole born sinner song 
"Typical ipun boy Nobody going to copy ugly Island Its apple who copies others and calls it innovation

Edit1 good news for you ipun boy as ipun now going to push ios161 with a new innovative feature where you can have battery percentage "
Do the pro max
Hate hate the obtrusive YouTubesk quick time player in safari i preferred when it was in the bottom it was better and easier to reach
Intro music is always ultimate
I think I will stick with my phone 13 pro for now I was about planning to buy iPhone 14 pro but when I see it is almost the same little bit differences in processor performance and some new features that dont matter to me probably get Samsung this time 5months left for the s23 ultra when you have money in your pocket it becomes a scratchy pocket 
So most probably selfies would comeout smudged because of all the touching  fingerprints on the selfie camera located next to island
great review as always and yes if you use an iPhone 11 or later phone this is not much of an update especially because youll get cool features with the new IOS16 if youre a XsMax baby like myself or earlier and you have the money yes definitely get this phone
I have 13 pro max worth or no To switch
Love your Hasselblad X2D
Ill be honest I hope Android phones dont receive the Dynamic Island It works for the iPhone because the notch is quite large compared to most Android phones however I feel its not necessary for Androids and it may even be a con
Im gonna need a recipe for that at 1820 puhhhhleasee Hey MKBHD here Ive been eating this for a couple minutes now and here are my thoughts
Dynamic island  Floating notch
We are going back in time phones without sim cards all programmed on your mobile like the 90s and call it eSim to sound cutting edge  this is the fucking worst
I knew MKBHD was a J Cole fan
i have the Galaxy S21 now im not sure if i should switch to Iphone for the first time in my life  btw Purple or space grey
"We are manufacturer sportswear and apparel if anyone need that hoodie or tracksuits in same or different design i can provide
"
0049 it you saw MKB walking around Taking pics with his phone  Paying for stuff with his phone then its safe to assume hes testing something new
you will always have to clean the front camera before use it
Oh Body  Over the years youve turned into an apple fanboy too Bravo
The selfie camera will keep getting smudged from all those swipestaps on the dynamic island lol
1515 that bug is invasive you gotta squish it 
Crazy pill  Itll be really funny if other companies copy it Its tooo distracting
1131 WAIT is this fake theres a screen in the pill
Does not having a SIM card mean my cell phone provider will charge me to hook up my phone  As of now I just change the SIM card
Yes absolutely blank stare lmao love it
Bla Bla Bla  everybody knows apple suck Dead inside  think for 2 sec
ill buy iPhone when it folds 
fk me that camera bump is thick
"About the eSIM idk if Im wrong but Apple makes most of it products thinking mostly in USA and some firstworld countries other version of the 14 do come with physical SIM Nothing new though things like the ECG and Fall detection are locked here in Costa Rica and in many other countries Maps hasnt been updated in like two years and its being replaced with GMaps Took 7 years for Apple Pay to be available There are many problems I could cover but basically bit of a shame from Apple 8 years using iPhone and recently upgraded to a Samsung 
Sorry if I wrote something wrong"
Time for a haircut buddy 
Hey MKBHD how can you get Apple to lend you a phone for review
Viewing this video on an iPhone 6s 
Can I ask for wallpaper download link
307 great review but are we really ignoring this 
I think this is a clever move by Apple dont update the normal iPhone 14 Instead improve the iPhone 14 Pro So if people want to have an upgraded experience they will pay extra 
547 UNBREADED
I do cant wait for Android OEMs to copy the Dynamic Island
"1 can i buy an iphone from eu so it has a physical sim
2 can i turn off the island features and animations"
Glad you gave LG its props LG definitely contributed a lot of creative ways we use our smart phones 
aod is smooth like windows phone 2014 iland is like laptop bar minimize and maximize
I like the name Dynamic Island I dont know why people hate it
i was waiting to hear about lg v10
love this new island thing but using it is gonna leave some pretty nice fingerprints 1300 so meh
Does the use of dynamic island mess with selfie quality since you constantly leave finger smudges on it
The proraw difference is insane
1300 there shouldnt be dead zone because touch screen is transparent whole screen is touchscreen
i always swap my sim between my android phone and my iphone so how do i do it now i hate dealing with the carriers sounds like carriers bought them off
Ive been waiting for so long to upgrade from my Oneplus 5T and the 14 Pro Max was on top of my list But after the launch   realising that its not a major upgradr over the 13 pro I am wondering whether i should go for this one or get a 13 pro max at a good deal
Let me get this straightapple did the best always on display but not worth to use itbecause drain the battery fast
Pakistani
 be taking these noobs money with little effort Here is the new  toilet paper it 20001 ply comes with an exclusive  dispenser which you must have to hold the  toilet paper that syncs with your  toilet shower mat and towel It was also rolled by hand by children in aisa with the  logo imprinted on every piece only 1099 dollars Oh and if your roll happen to unroll  will reroll your unrolled toilet paper for 500  shipping and handling not included  think disabled reroll your roll yourself will void your warranty

Does anyone know what widget that is on the left at 609

East or West iPhone the best
I love to see that the back glass is a separate component now Apple has been consistently making it more and more difficult for people to repair their devices and its nice to see them stray from that a little bit
"I Am YouTuber   Mera bike channel hai 
Mera channel se Aapka help ho sakata hai "
Buddy that intro needs to be a commercial Apple hire this man
Dont do this Marques Dont do that Marques  Marques does the total opposite 
Dynamic island looks smooth but what about the finger prints on the front facing camera
FANTASTIC 
"Me dreaming of having an iphone 14 pro since i never had an iphone in my life
MB beliked 308"
Is anyone going to mention that the dynamic island encourages you to get your grubby fingers all over the front facing camera
off topic but this stuck white pixel in the interview camera view is bugging me lmao
"Android user here Will move to the iPhone 15 once they have USB C

While I believed that Android could get to where they need to go Ive been disappointed as of late

 Android for tablets still suck because the app ecosystem still sucks
 Pixels new chips were not as big of a deal as I thought they would be
 Android cannot leverage any major network effects for things like Airtags"
So does the 48MP only work in RAW mode
so should i upgrade my samsung s8 or not
Macs very happy with the review 
Marques casually dropping the first iPhone Im actually interested in
Cool tan mark from the apple watch lol 1814
I dont want an iSland I just want an iPhone
love it thanks man
maybe go under a bridge at speed and drop the phone inside a bus or a car Then the location can get confused and the g sensors also go off  Also trying hard braking hard acceleration cornering light speed bumps etc that in some cars have triggered airbags that may also false trigger an iphone
Apple and Rolex have a lot in common They dont need to innovate to create buzz or brand loyalty Theyre just keeping the engine running until theyre forced to compete again
No ones gonna copy this pill thing cuz its useless No one wants a giant eye sore when next gen phones are transitioning to the camera hidden behind the screen apple used this cuz no one likes the i thing it had originally As per usual apple ripping people off by recycling last gen phones in order to save money and people are buying into it its sad
that seagull sound in the intro when the island was highlighted I see you Marques
Marques why didnt you tell us about geekbench single core score and difference bw last gen for the same A bit biased 
If only hunter and her friend had an Iphone 14 no fall I guess 
Content quality is superb bro
People complaining that theres a notch we like the notch we dont want it to go
Great one Can we have another video on the things oneplus is promising on with Oxygen 13 and the fate of Oneplus phones
Accidental detection drives me nuts Like when Im driving for more than an hour driving 75 on the freeway and my watch tells me its time to stand up Sure great idea Siri
"Still pushing iPhone X here Honestly this model is a tank Im going to drive it into the ground or update to oblivion

Safari is still really snappy"
I wonder if the car crash feature could be triggered by a roller coaster
Oh I thought they wanted the clamp to be like hidden in the back
In college 25 of the population enrolled was Chinese on school visas They ALWAYS had the assistive touch on the screen Idk why A cultural thing But very useful I tried it out myself I feel like those people will absolutely love the dynamic island But the idea was kinda there already hidden away in the accessibility options Not precisely the same but close
I thought that MI phone would still be the best camera phone
6 million views and only 240k likes  what up with that
I dont see no major additions on the iPhone 14 I feel like the iPhone 15 will definitely have a major upgrade and the dynamic island will evolve this year is just a test it out type of phone
The dynamic island is the best feature Ive seen so far in a phone since 3 years
Which Lock Screen widgets are you using there in the video thumbnail Binary clock  LMK
I want to make enough money so I can also throw expensive stuff like that on the ground or against the wall without skipping a beat and continue with my life as nothing happened 
Love these reviews
The black king of YouTube
Going from samsung s10e exynos to 14 pro max pretty hyped
I have the exact same summer watch tan line at 1814  Random silly question though if you wear your watch on your right wrist why does your left wrist have the tan line
Your hoodie are the exact color of my countrys flag Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean big fan bro
So this time we wont get to see review of iphone 14 and 14 plus
Heads up to all T mobile gave me an iPhone 14 pro for 200 dollars with iPhone 11 trade in 800 dollars for the iPhone 11 for an upgrade to the iPhone 14 pro They said Ive been with them for 5 plus years and wanted me to continue as a valued customer  I couldnt pass the deal up this time
I MISS STEVE JOBS
Very Underwhelming
 SUBSCRIBE
I still love my LG  Great review
Since there isnt much more processing power from the 13 Pro Max why isnt the photonic engine available on the 13 too  
I wonder how long it takes MK to get ProRes video off of his phone with lightning 
in an extremely consumerist environment where influencers are a walking advertisement at this point and we are all pushed to always have the latest and greatest new gadget your candidness and honesty is greatly appreciated you are one of the biggest tech youtubers and youre constantly getting deals from the big brands and stuff it would be easy for you to just push ppl to buy this new device but you still take the time to be frank  direct and state the honest truth no matter how hard brands try to push us to buy their latest product the average iphone 11 or later user wouldnt really notice a big difference between their current phone and upgrading to the 14 pro no matter how cool that new shiny phone is thanks for your honesty and great review as always
You always have the best wallpapers please send the link for us to download the wallpapers seen in the video
Samsung lovers on here like dam iPhone killing it but what can I say to try get a dig in If u notice u get more android ppl on these channels than vice verse
Pixel Phones already uses crash detections several time ago nothing new
so is there anything different about it
Im not going test that

If I would make decisions inside the Apple you would never be invited again You will never get your dirty ass inside the Apple
Soooo disapointing no 8K 6K would be ok but we are stuck on 4K
Waiting for the release and review of the Pixel 7Ultra before I make an apple of myself 
Just saw Supersafs post bro i was hoping for least 67feet height of u 
Great information for the regular consumer Dropping a G on iPhone is never good
If they will not support dual esim then that is a big downgrade for people like me Im using esim and physical at the same time from two different countries and I am sure there are many people like me
Dear mkbhd sir I want apple 14 pro
"Wallpaper in the beginning of the video
"
This video was on the very bottom of my recommended
Screen Idle on your screenshot  is that the metric for the Always On Display
I phone 14 pro Max please
That always on display is straight trash
Another incredible intro video made by the team
"Both MKBHD and The Verge are reporting slightly less battery life than expected coming from the 13 Pro models Theyre attributing it to either the AlwaysOn display or intensive camera testing during the review period

Im sure well get some indepth testing over the next few weeks with more concrete results"
Yes so TRUE
"1604 That fly Im famous mom
Probably"
excellent video
Any chance for Always on Display for other older models than 14pro
Broooo what ab if you throw your phone like some peeps do in anger I bet that trips it
Yeah like the LG V20 had the second screen that was similar to the island thingy
I honestly would really prefer if other OEMs dont try to copy the Dynamic Island idea especially if it were to mean giving up space for notification badges To me the notification badges are way more valuable to my phone use than the Dynamic Island would ever be
You seem to hype the Dynamic Island a lot frankly it just looks like regular functionality of a notification bar to me another excuse for the notch design This is one of those iPhone releases that is only a stepping stone and you should probably wait a couple more before upgrading
Imagine cleaning ur front camera due to fingerprint marks after the dual tasking on the island
no just me  
Watching iPhone 14 video with 20 in my bank account 
Honestly IPhone users are some of the most gullible people on earth  Like 13 and 14 are virtually the same product
That is one ugly looking design after seeing the new island i feel like the notch design was much better

Watching iphone 14 pro review on my pixel 2 
AOD will kill battery health faster than ever Even whatever technology pack in 14 pro or pro max why should apple disable or completely finish the battery health system in OS what is the actual purpose of this feature everything they explained that is bullshit For the last 3 years i am not buying any apple phones because of this feature every user knows about his usage of battery after 1 year battery is not the same as new it is normal fact when you use any device on daily basics its will happen why apple need to indicate that you battery need to change that is nonsense and cheating
Guess ill wait for next year
This wouldnt be hard to adapt to the notch they just want it to be a 14 pro feature
When you do a graph mind adding units please 
just remember if you fix your iphone yourself without Apple parts youll get that fun lil message about nonauthentic parts popping up to let you know youre inferior
While android companies are making unnecessary and buggy products features etc apple are making quality stuff everything apple do is elegant and made to perfection Thats why I switched to Apple a year ago Ive been an android user all my life and although I dont have regrets I will say that I wished I had switched sooner lol Apple stand out from the crowd they do things differently which is why theyre the most successful company they make top quality products unlike Samsung that only cares about hardware design I prefer quality over quantity so Im sticking with Apple Everything Apple do is like diamond quality android companies could learn a thing or two from Apple I really like the dynamic island it looks really cool So simple and elegant Such a perfected device
2212 Can somebody please tell me the name of the outro song
Love the graphics Way to go Team
not impressive at all very boring new features im gonna pass this one
I am getting a feeling that Xiaomi will copy the Dynamic island feature of iphone 14 for sure
TOO LONG VIDEO 
I really love your videos the reviews always are certain

I really hope that EU will force apple to deliver a phone with a sim card tray in Europe as they did with the USBC charging port
Not much in the way for hardware changes to get met to upgrade my phone but the software update is where its at for me and thats where I think thats the focus for Apple this year watchOS and iOS QoL updates are huge for me
I honestly cant tell between any iPhones 
Stock headed back up today as well gotta buy that dip baby
No more apple Unless apple utilizes current connections type c will not degrade to apple
Hi Where can we DOWNLOAD you wallpaper Link please
Link to your wallpaper please
Love your videos
What do you love about the iphone 14 pro
first time I see a honest review from MKBHD to an IPhone that is not bias Also I just watched the video to see his opinion on the new Island thing
"Love seeing LG get its love that they deserve for all the features that LG brought well before any other brands time and time again Truly innovative even if they didnt fully catch on They seem to be catching on years later in other phones

Still miss LG so much Plan on rocking my V60 Dual Screen for easily the next 5 years If this had 90120hz i would probably never move up for a lot longer

This phone still always makes people do double takes and asks what it is"
so if u make the camera dirty by touching it  Its ridiculous
Did He forget about the battery or its just me 
SighSamsung Z fold you say
i havent update my phone yet  because apple will make my phone slow  P
So glad i never gave a shit about apple products past the og ipod
That intro just wow 
Why didnt you show any 189 youtube video in landscape mode I want to see how much of the content does the dynamic island eat up
ayeeee intro throw back
Still hate iphone
That dynamic island is such a cool design idea
Gimmick Turn it in landscape mode and tell me what u really think
Is there a way we can disqble dynqmic island iPhone 14 Pro I feel it can drain battery a lot
Bro you gotta murder those lantern flies Thats an invasive species
I cant believe Im the only one who despises the dynamic island idea not because it isnt useful but because it draws SO much more attention to the one part of the screen I dont like And of course it will be copied apple did it which means we can all turn off our brains and accept it now I was hoping wed get rid of it by this point
Im going to wait for the iPhone with thunderbolt 4
As fun as it lookssounds the cutout takes up a lot of screen space and attract too much attention gaming andor watching videos
Well for me still is a physical notch no matter how Apple innovated it  15 years for now at some point they will get rid of it and will claim another innovation Yes they perfect their phones but you must to keep buying the same Apple phones over and over to get slowly some innovations They made a bigger Watch they have ever made but still is an Apple Watch  I bet Samsung will follow suit but they will give you more freedom to customize it and of course not as the Apple way
Upgrading to the 14 pro from a OnePlus 6 lmao
almost 6 milliom views in one day congrats
how does the crash detector work on rollercoasters vs a car crash

I wont pay amount of money for a iPhone  looks like iPhone 13 pro and no body realiza that you have iPhone 14 pro  at list you tell them hahahahahahahahahaha
Where do you get that wallpaper that is on his iPhone 
Youre just a typical apple fangay
smudges all over my front camera
Been saying this for years We have reached a tech wall for our smart phones Get use to the minimal upgrades for years to come Maybe apple can perfect the flip and fold phone without the crease but thats a hard maybe
Anyone knows if Google Fi works with this Esim only stuff and what are the limitations
Yes those auto elliptical workouts are hilarious I get em too bro 
1031 Color matching waveformfor Waveform
Your take made me laugh   
Totally skipped over battery life
I am not gonna sit here and watch 22 mins of dragging the little upgrades that apple brought Lets agree all these features are already out there and nothing great is here and move on with your life
Did someone say creative customizable AODs 
Very subtle plug
Any idea if iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro has same case
"looking to move to iOS from android now
should i get the now cheaper 13pro or just get the 14pro Im down to wait till black friday sales for the 13pro"
I love that iPhone drop it deserves to be on the floor
I loved how confident and proud your face got when mentioning the 24fps cinematic mode part lol
Why were all official wallpapers from Apple on the IPhone deleted with the new update I actually liked the wallpaper from the IPhone 13
Cant wait to live my dreams and buy an iPh with 3 Cameras always admired it when I see on people
S24 gonna blow this out the water

So iPhone 14 is still 60ghz what a crap
Sep 15th 2022 This video appears as number one on trending 
I want your wallpaper please
Can someone tell me whether always touching that island makes your front camera always smudgy
the dynamic island shows how the hardware engineers messed up and the software engineers did an amazing job hiding it
What does Apple plan on doing about its chronic bluetooth issues Everyone I know who owns an Apple device including me is having bluetooth issues And please dont tell me what to do to fix it doesnt work Once it decides its not going to work with a particular device thats it game over I have three Apple phones all are experiencing this issue with different devices I will not buy another Apple device again
48MP Apple youre almost there 
No dude it wont this overpriced garbage sucks btw you look homeless

Hey MKBHD I want you to draw your attention on the drastic fall in the battery backup of my i phone 12 after the ios 16 update Pls raise this concern of mine Really like your videos and love from India 
If you continue to speak such nice words about Apple without knowing it absolute hardware and software then I am going to subscribe your channel thats it
Fanboy calling it a camera king just by using it for some weeks lol  Wtf is this  review The title itself screams Blind apple fanboy nothing else
anyone got any kingshoter007 videos saved
Looks like there is really no point of upgrading Nothing really that makes me be like I must have this phone good video tho 
555 they fixed it
Did he Marques just casually drop the brand new ipphone 14 pro without even looking to see if it was ok lmaooo
apple has always been the trendsetter

Every time i watch his videos i get reminded why this guy has 16 million followers
Cant wait for my IPhone 14 Pro to arrive in the mail this weekend
Hlo bro
Its just 13 pro with a software update
He said this will be copied So no company will copy now
Idk my s22 ultra have a way better camera but I cant stand the phone Its beyond glitchy so going with 14 pro but keeping my s22 ultra as back up phone on second line but mainly just using it as main camera
Overpriced phones Fooling people to spend money
when are you going to visit Rich Rebuilds studios
Is there a sleep mode for the always on display like on the apple watch with the nice alarm clock
Connecting airpods was like Dodge in the 5 Ds of dodgeball 
Thank You Man  You Literally Saved My Money From This Shit  13 Pro Is Pretty Much Enough For Me 
The dynamic Island on the new iPhone 14s isnt userfriendly when used with one hand 
12 Pro to 14 Pro Worth the jump Got rid of cameras to use only the iPhone for video creation so what do you guys think

"Honestly

Intro Text  Display camera etc Doesnt show the quality of your channel  In My opinion Chapter Titles all over the screen is just doesnt match the Standards of MKBHD"
Apple just renamed dynamic island into the Ipatch
Funny The Euro US Dollar exchange rate is currently 1 The iPhone 14 Pro Max 256 GB costs you 135985 dollars with taxes right In Germany the same iPhone costs 1579 euros with taxes Over 200 dollarseuro more 
A fun way of hiding that intrusive notch but with one MAJOR flaw the top of the screen is the absolute worst place to put a notification bar that requires taps or swipes
felt like u make review on favour to iPhone  am no a android fan too
Interesting you have a reminder to floss your teeth Marques 
How are screen protectors going to be handled Will it completely ruin the seamlessness of the Island among the sensors and the surrounding widgets
Piz
Apple is successful in the sense of making people enjoy seeing and using what had been an eyesore for years Managed to turn its weakness into its strength
Idk Id like to take advantage of the new camera system BUT no USBC is really dumb The Ipad mini with an A15 bionic has USBC Theres no excuse for the iphone 14 to have omitted USBC
Idk but its already COPPED
Ill wait till dynamic island is standard ig
Of course it will be copied By samsung
Great video but where are the reviews for fold and flip 4

0 chance Im ever going to use an always on display Itll just distract me constantly by making me think I got a notification Also just look at your wrist if you want to know the time
I currently have a iPhone 11 and feel like upgrading to the 14 pro for the screen resolution and dynamic island is worth it
RIP LG 
Yawn
its 2022 and the main feature being marketed for the pro iPhones is animations around the notch  damn its so sad seeing how hard these tech youtubers are trying to advertise pure garbage
Always on display makes it look like any other Android phone
have you noticed that the latest ios16 update does drain the battery a little faster than the previous update ios157
That wallpaper link please
"Ive watched the AutoFocus series and have to say I am not impressed with that camera quality Granted I watch a lot of your vids so knew the camera pairing and was watching critically but I did see a lot of artifacts that were solely due to the camera  
Also why does everyone feel like car crash detection is such an amazing thing Its a way for Apple to convince people to track them in multiple media all the time For what How often has 911 not gotten phone calls about car crashes or impending ones Out in the boonies maybe on low population areas Same places an iPhone isnt likely to get a connection either Why isnt anyone asking what Apple is doing with that data besides crash detection and how they are securing it  
All this feels like another Apple circus trimming the walled garden while everyone watches the pretty lights"
Just tell us what will be copied and stfu nick cannon
USB C 
what widget is that one the lockscreen in the thumbnail with the dots
So the battery icoon is full but says 22 That can be very confusing
LG had some decent ideas back in the day And why would Apple think that showing the background at all was a good idea for an alwaysondisplay Obviously that would hurt battery and thats much more important than a dimmed background Ive only used androids and currently the pixel 6 pro but its had so many issues it makes me keep the idea of finally trying an iphone in the back of my mind Maybe next year ya know when they change to usbc lol yeah right
Touching the front camera for the dynamic island explains the stupidity of apple people in 2022
Are you going to test the new Motorola edge 30 ultra phone with a 200 megapixels
Pass  much like past 14 ones lol
I dont think anyone else is going to be copying this because everyone else has split screen mode which I am still waiting for on Apple I honestly dont care about a pill button  that can switch between two apps  And Im very disappointed that they didnt make Always on display available for everyone with the new update Apple is way to overhyped and Im honestly thinking about switching to Samsung 
The phone does not have a true 48 MP sensor as it uses Quad Pixel Binning

704 that thing is not apple way its alright happen on pixel devices
I really like the hoodie but I am from India and hesitant that Ill receive the wrong size I dont understand how itll fit me

RIP iPhone mini
How are we non US citizens be able to buy an iphone with sim card tray when we travel to US Here in Argentina for example the only way we can get iphones at a normal price is by going to USA
"Respect to MKB for giving credit to LG

RIP LG wish you were still in the game  You would continue to drive the innovation"
Guys so cool throughout the videohuh
I cant defend an upgrade even from my iPhone XS Max this year
"The pros look so good now without that terrible forehead
I want to see what the s23ultra has to offer before i decide
Does the always on display turn off after a certain amount of hours of no activity I like to use always on display when i sleep to not just to keep up with recent notifications when im moving around"
Disabled the download option lol
Dynamic island is just too wordy I get what theyre trying to convey but the island would just feel better IMHO
First time you speak truth and bad things about i phone about notification panel which was invented by LG as you said thats why I liked this video 
Whats the name of the song played between sections Sounds like a Hokus Pokus remix I didnt find it on Spotify
oh my god he is using 5G band
Can you tell me the wallpaper you are using  Thanks
Apple team watched Fall movie and was like hey we need to have a feature that can help someone in that situation Hmmm  satellite connectivity
Cant wait for iPhone  Ultra
millions of  invested in an attempt to get rid of notch and turn it into animated pill Amazing D
Basically what ur saying is Apple drop the ball with this one this phone lack innovation period
Things when notifications are exciting
Not sure why people are not bothered much by NO physical sim tray by saying it just impacts international travellers but not sure what to do if iPhone breaks stops working or we submit it apple store We can no longer take sim out and put it in other phone temporarily can we  Am I the only one thinking about this 
The intro was really lit Great job
Thumb this up so people are aware Selfie pics  video are going to be bad with this phone That dynamic stranded island will be terrible when it comes to fingerprints and greasy hands lol
And here I am still using an iPhone XS Max 
Because im a dynamic islaaaand boooy
For incoming calls can you still select the full screen option or does it force you to use the banner style notification via the dynamic island
"Me Watching Iphone 14 review
Meanwhile YouTube Ads Samsung"
hope you killed that lantern fly
They should have called it The Touchbar
As somewhat of an iOS hater despite having an ipad android just doesnt compete I have to say the dynamic island is pretty neat I am curious to see how it gets copied actually
As everyone says i think Ill wait for the next one
Years behind basically a brick
The notch fall off a bit  become  now waiting for 15
the ending 
Can you do a video where you show it using the lupe app which allows you to zoom way much more in
what about upgrading before the phone trade in is worthless That might be another factor to consider for those with an iPhone 11 or 12
Nice to see Apples dragging its feet Again
310 Im with you my guy I gotchu
Thank you for mentioning LG I was going to comment on this like why is no one is talking about it
Can we get the wallpaper plzzzzz
Apple would rather put a new display chip in the phone than simply making the notch smaller Great job apple 
Widget on the lockscreen
Anyone else kinda surprise with the design choice of the Dynamic Island feature list That was so out of character aesthetics for an MKBHD video  No hatejust saying
726 great song btw
Im only interested in the iPhone promax for filming purposes So memory connectivity to my computer to download the files are my main interests iPhone works well because android will only record for 10 minutes Max then stop that has been my experience iPhone will continue to record as long as you have memory I dont use Apple for anything other than videography and sometimes photography I wish Apple will go with the  type c port A massive memory like 2 to 3TB which they can and a whopping camera that will be able to have all the adjustments of zoom inandout with focal face detection hats all Im looking for Jobs isnt around so will probably have to wait until the iPhone 30 before theyll actually get it done Well since they dont seem to listen to the consumer Job would have definitely did it and charged you up the leftovers but we would have seen it not our grandkids
whats the name of that widget with dots on the lockscreen
As always on point with a dope review
I stopped upgrading my phone when they introduced two cameras on the back I just want one camera on the back Im 30 by the way soyeah The only way I would get a more modern upgrade again would be once they combine all those damn cameras and make one big one OR at the very least make it look like one camera but if you look closely you can see that its multiple cameras
Congrats on number 1 trending Marques
Im curious Whats the name of that song and whos the artist
So it will be copied from LG Apple was just the first to copy it
Rather a simple hole punch apple adverts persuade many  features are amazing when its old on android Wake up

I hate how the battery seems always full and you can barely read the percentage inside because its white
The dynamic jelly 
I paid full for it so Im going to use it Proceeds to test crash detection 
But we demand drastically changes from other carriers every year OR we belittle what they do upgrade as incremental or insignificant We need impartial content because this aint it
I have a standard iPhone 11 and Ive considered upgrading The only reason Id upgrade is the satellite connectivity which I hear Americans saying is a pretty meh feature here in Canada there are a lot of places that dont have sell phone service especially when skiing biking or hiking in the mountains
Apple copied it As they have done pther features such as AOD Man this is getting ridiculous  Apple has to be paying these people to be so biased like this
Make that money MARQUES Keep growing 
                 redmi   problem hai
"Nice Tshirt colour Egypt flag 
Great review as usual "
samsung will copy it
Arent all the phones getting always on display
225 My Google pixel has that car crash feature and guess what It works Thats why Im typing with one hand
You would know How 
Ive not owned an iPhone since the 6 Plus however this one is teasing me I love the black version you showed and the stabilisation looks outstanding
The brighter screen is kind of pointless when iOS automatically lose your brightness even with auto off Currently as it is on my iPhone 13 if I am outside it will not let me go up on the brightness it just sticks it at half way
It was not the first phone to have a pill cut out but it will be copied because they did it
Seriously dont understand the hype for the dynamic island
as much as i dislike apple i am impressed by the dynamic island and more so that they actually show some innovation
I think the Dynamic Island is such a creative idea Gotta try it out Upgrade from 11pro Ordered the the Pro Max to try a larger phone for awhile
that intro babyy sooo smooth that Im fallin for it 
the battery is a little low because of the new iOS update 16 the issue might get resolved as soon as apple releases another update
Anybody know where I can get that intro music that remix of I cant make you love me is 
iPhone copying and introducing all new features of other phones noone says a shit but any phones take the one two things they start out and out goes the word copied 
I love MKBHD reviews the most of all youtube reviewers but honestly this one seems a bit biased against Apple As if someone pissed him off at the event or elsewhere iPhone 14 in my opinion is better than advertised in this review And Im saying that as an Android user D
Dynamic Island looks terrible please dont let it continue its the best apple can do but androids have way better options that look wayyyyy better
"Not getting a new iPhone till USBC I can record pro res on my 13 pro but transferring through Lightning cable takes SO LONG and it crashes half of the time transferring to my macbook 

Why allow us to record files that large if its that impractical to get them out"
No no no that camera bump is not okay Just because people have gotten used to camera bumps doesnt mean you keep increasing the size The bump with this model is just ugh We need to consider this and call it a problem so that it gets heard
Today I saw a video where the iPhone 14 Pro Max destroyed the Galaxy 22 Ultra in camera and display quality
The dynamic island is cool for software but i hate the pill cutout for media consumption I Will stick with my 13 pro Max
Nice set
I miss my LG V10 to this day Went to an S7 Edge after it and then a G8 ThinQ that I still rock to this day I think people will like the DI a lot I know I liked my second screen quite a bit
The intros theyre getting better and better
can we take moon pics like samsungs yet lol
android ppls complaining about apple have same desing like last year   but android have same desing like in 2018  and still freaking laggy after 6 month hard use 
The intro itself makes the video worth watching
This is really the most boring iphone launch ever Their entirely depending on their powerful A16 chip at this point Thats the only sell point they have
I would like YouTube to take advantage of Dynamic Island so the sound could play while clearing up screen real estate for other apps
1 on trending and i love to see it
yet another great intro
Sooo switch to the S22 Ultra Got it 
The dynamic island is so simple Surprised nobody else used it before more than LG that is
Domenic island is a great name
I love the dynamic island and i think it could be possible with the notch iPhone as well  maybe on my iPhone 13 because of a smaller notch
Can you turn off always on display
Watching this I get the impression that iPhone users are always crashing into things never travel outside America and always get lost inside America Either Apple is really trying to shovel features or they precisely know their market
I love how bubbly and bouncy the cutout is I guess thats why I like Apple so much they make technology feel really friendly
Always on display 
No USBC is the biggest disappointment
I got the 13 Pro Max alpine green and there aint no way Im switching to the 14 Pro Max cos the hardware is exactly the samethat aint move me at all Gonna wait it out for the 15 series and see what they come up with
iPhone 14 is Made In India Im proud we are helping build such impressive device
intro is sick
dynamic island is the perfect name if you really have better name than that then surely let the whole world know then we will laugh on your suggested shitty name   
Bro astrophotography is so far out it is literally impossible to catch it with an iPhone camera Not this year not any year It is very complicated
Samsung will copy Apple and call it flying saucer
Any comments on Battery Issues after IOS 16 update Using Iphone 13 Iphone 12 and Iphone 11 in the family and all are facing the same issue
Anddddd android will copy the pill shaped cutout Sloppily just like the notch
Some Samsung fanboys on Twitter were bashing MKBHD for saying slightly but forgot to mention the more than he expected
Did I just see the new Hasselblad X2D  dream camera
Upgrading from the Samsung Note 9 from back in 2018 Keen to make the transition from Android to Apple Its been 15 years Lol
Id rather just have a top bezel that has increased functionality than a pull cutout
I find always on display elegant and exciting for iPhone I enjoyed having it on my older Samsung S8 I switched to iPhone years ago The next feature I would like Apple to implement is a builtin simplified ringtone creator from iOS where you can take any snippet of your Apple Music fade it in and out at the beginning and end and set it as your notification tone or ringtone
"Apple haters are so mad right now that new feature like dynamic island just works lol cant wait to see halfbaked copies on android with crappy performance even with all those rams

And when he mentioned that AOD drains more battery i guess that definitely made them moist"
should I wait for the next Galaxy samsung or buy IPhone 14 pro max
Is the noise canceling function enabled during a call
I wish the government would force them to open source that crash test data feature so that this database of recorded information could be used by everyone not just iphone
Lets just all remember that reaching the top of any screen is a terrible accessibility idea That goes on the opposite direction of what OneIU has been doing for years now
How about PWM
So basically everytime Im using Dynamic Is Im smudging the camera
Its nice that the AOD will turn off when youre not near your phone because you are wearing an Apple Watch Wish Samsung with their watches would copy that
Yea imma keep my 13 pro max I bought the z fold 4 Im in love with itios 16 on iphone 13 pro max is basically a iphone 14 pro maxI also have the s22 ultra I hate it now because its so slow compared to the other 2

apple knows how to take features created long time ago by another company and make it 10x better
I dont quite understand why this dynamic island is being described as such a good thing It does make the notch becoming more funny during daily use But tbh the notch is a real problem when I watch videos or play games This new position of the notch simply makes it worse
Any one give me the new iPhone 14
The black
everythingapplepro does it better
What i want is a phone that can give me at least 12hrs of SOT time for extremely heavy use
I hope they get rid of the stupidity of the lens flare glitch that are there since iphone 11
This is just a way to excused the instruction of the cut out is just a simple notification a distraction for not making a full screen
"MKBHD  Apple talked 7 mins out of 23 mins on camera  approx 33
Apple  MKBHD talked 6 mins out of 22 mins on camera  approx 33
Pretty similar
BTW nice video"
iPhone is so boring
the intro song gives me nostalgia for some reason
Compare the Samsung ultra camera to this camera at night to the moon
Well on android u can just scroll down from the top and have all these controls like in tge Island just less fancy
Imagine the innovations LG would be making if they were still in the smartphone business
No sim tray  no go for me
THESE INTROS ARE 
Question so if my car calls the emergency services and the iPhone They will both take up one line each to the emergency services for others that might need it Is it possible to disable it or that they work together to sync it with cars that have native apps somehow
Jerryrig everything will try  the car crash
Thanks for the LG V10 shoutout Thats immediately what I thought about when I saw the functionality of the Dynamic Island Apple has now incorporated major unique features of most of my prior Android phones Prior V10Moto Z2 PlayZ4 owner
its better for samsung not to copy it the punch hole camera is enough already and non obtrusive as this island

the Dynamic Island sucks Its more than ever prominent now on the screen also to reach it you need two hands or to really stretch your palm fingerprints are prone to happen there as well Its a cheap gimmick something like those street artists do to make the broken road look better but it doesnt fix anything

The e some saves space right  And the Europe version have still a normal sim  is in the EU version any downside because of the less space  Like battery performance Or is in the us version just an empty space where the normal sim was inside the phone

"That intro Bro

Am I the only one seeing who restarted the video 6 times just for the intro I think coming back with 20syl brings back that MKBHD nostalgic magic vibes


Incredible creativity here"
I honestly think the Dynamic Island is just another one of the small marketing schemes that apple does that works so well Even though there is still a notch this new feature made it look new for most people
I recongnized two song both are classic for me The first one was Jcole Born Sinner and the second one was Kanye West Graduation Cool video with nice stuff on the screen as example

What about the battery compared to the 13 pro max
Great down to earth review  Thanks
even have a little upgreade but still more evpensive than last model
Dope Now Id like to see a pill cut out on the MacBooks too I always hated the other notch
Awesome intro I have ever seen
There is a lot of incorrect information and the main purpose of this review is to criticize Apple and not educate followers
"MehStyle over substance

thank you MKBHD   Imagine a foqing notch be a feature rather be wiped or bury instead of getting type c or even mage safe 3 on iphone its be uniq new update feature but that never happen
What widget is that on the Lock Screen

What about iPhone 8 Plus should I upgrade

I come to you cause Justine wont ever talk bad about iPhone products
I didnt know he favored iPhone and he said we didnt get that
Ha The intro shows a rotated iPhone because face ID now works in landscape 
I can see a bunch of 911 calls from just riding a roller coaster  
People calling dynamic island a shit or marketing gimmickMark my words now every company will start copying it especially the Chinese shit
I dunno As I look at that pill longer I think its ugly Functional yes but ugly
The implementation of Iphone 14s always on display is better because its literally always on Unlike others only when its tapped it would show the always on display I turn it off on my One Plus
I currently have an Xs Max for quite a long time now and am considering an upgrade to a newer phone I was planning to upgrade to the 13 Pro when it came out but I didnt see much of an upgrade from the 12 so I decided to wait Now that the 14 is out should I still go with the 13 Pro or would it be better to spend around 200 more this is the price difference between the 2 in my country and get the 14 Pro
TERRIFIC     
been loving the JCole references lately
That satellite SOS feature is really impressive I was lost in one trek in forest and I know how important it is Not a apple fanboy but really kudos to AppleVery impressive
Im thinking of upgrading my S10 Galaxy to an iPhone Ill probably get a iPhone 13 because the iPhone 14 upgrades from the 13 are really minuscule I think
Bro which colour is best   Black or white in iPhone 13 plzz tell me I m confused
what a intro man
What makes me laughThey make the camera housing bigger by 1mm so you have to buy a new case rather than using the iPhone 13 cases lol
Wonder if being on a rollercoaster could trigger car crash detection 
"Suggestion to apple 
The space in between the notch can be used as a classic notification indicator while the screen is locked"
Im fairly interested in getting an apple watch SE which will be my introduction to the line Would be great if you did a video on the watches to help people like me who are just getting into apple watch
I think they will swap to USBC next year due to the new EU regulations In Europe at least
I just noticed that the camera is separated from the face id 953
"OH great 
i phone 14 has a rasist camara"

Im still sticking with my iphone Xr for years cellphones have been a hard pass changing so minor things I feel like they reach a peak phones are turning dumb very very slowly
Is there going to be a chance in the future that we could win one of phones 14
LG V10 called it second screen
If If my phone has IP68 it wouldnt be gaming on it when on the pool
Thank God  Happy with my 13 pro 
iPhone 14 range still has a lightning port which is USB 20 2012 technology in 2022 flagship phones No thank you Ill wait for the next one
look at this graph 1403
Me iPhone 14 Works when your in the hospital
I actually really love the dynamic display Id pay the phone if I could In fact Id by a new iphone every year if I could regardless lol Anyone know what breed of dog that is
What does the island mean in terms of screen protector Usually you dont want them to cover the camera as that can ruin Face ID etc My screen protector has a cutout for the notch but that would surely ruin the dynamic island experience
LG  stopped making phones so now iphone gets its features lol I had a V20 with a small screen above to display info 
You didnot talk much on battery performance  How strange 
"Yeah so nothing really new until next year maybe

Thanks for your review"
Still slow lightning
Looks useless but since youre a big YouTuber and sheep follow Im sure it will be copied
"I feel like apple did the whole US only for esim so that a lot of people will start buying their iPhones from other countries and then they benefit from the fact that they made them more expensive in said countries  
Its just something to think about"
Im glad that although being poor I had access to all the features 2 years ago Also with only fraction of the price
I dont know Im not sure I see the dynamic island being copied too much or at least if it is itll be a much different experience on Android Most Android phones are able to hide the facial recognition hardware MUCH better than Apple has done here so the need for a big pill like that just isnt there Personally Id rather have the screen real estate than that thing anyway but what I could see working on Android is if they make the notification bar as a whole change how it looks and functions depending on what app youre using while still being able to show the most important stuff but again you would likely have to make the notification bar larger than it already is Itll be interesting to see what happens
Hii Marquez Im Danny im a huge fan of all your videos the way you explain each and every thing is absolutely amazing Ive been waiting for the iphone 14 pro and i saw the event it was amazing i want get hands on one iphone i havent used an iphone so i love the 14 pro version can i please get a giveaway from your side please
"Funny how a regular Apple user gets amazed by some small gimmicks
Also they tend to forgive Apple for not innovating and taking more money for the old stuff"
Did I just see the battery  back  0358
"Its not even that Apple is so good its just that Android is so poor Over the last years
Apple always had the biggest ugliest notch of all Phones while Android found different cool solutions like smaller holepunch notches But nobody managed to actually do anything with it No functionality

And to be clear nobody needs a notch to build those features of the dynamic island You could have just made these features without a hole in your display Buuuuut just nobody did 

And that is my problem nobody does cool stuff anymore so Apples kinda cool stuff looks so awesome

I miss the times of the funny quirky and great Android Phones
I use the OnePlus 7T Pro and in my mind its the last cool phone 

I know i will have to upgrade at some point And I miss the times where new Phones came out and I just felt amazed what could be done and the progress thats been made 
Boring last years

Android used to be fun Apple used to be boring But Android got so boring that Apple needs to be fun And they kinda manage Kinda"
Oyyy is Apple going to be upset about that ifixit sponsorship
I used LG GS290 in my school days it was a java phone but felt superior to android in so many ways
Rip LG Many great innovations that have been copied polished and implemented by many others
That dynamic island crap What for Already have a notification bar Maybe some others will copy it for a bit like they did with the horrendous notch then decide its not worth it and move on
Fingerprint  fingerprints on the selfie camera 
This will be copied Of course thats the whole purpose of the GROUPIES They will copy emulate all sorts of stupid ideas from a satanically run company like Apple Inc  How many retarded design ideas have been made mainstream by Apple because it fashionable  Cool The next thing we know is that the rest of the industry is following in their footsteps GROUPIES Gotta love them 
"Is there any feature that iPhone 14 pro does not have and iPhone 14 pro Max does have 
Except size and Price 
I am considering buying iPhone 14 pro"
Samsung and LG did what the Dynamic island feature in notification but just not as smooth and complete as the Apple way
Gotta pre order XXL Im good i was gonna support but you not supporting my size 
"me riding bike on a bumpy road

I accidentally throw my phone bc I wear a caseso my phone will think im crashing my car
Nah they wont copy this
Super bright and colourful always on displayit seems to consume battery more than I was anticipatingreally
That small dynamic island would have made a pleasingly slim dynamic notch which would have taken up far less important screen real estate Pushing the camera cluster away from the top edge really just pushes it more into the usable screen without giving anything back Who cares about that 12 mm sliver of OLED at the top Its just wasted space
That intro is a steal
Amazing video with some fantastic fun commentary Thank you

Idk if Im being accurate but either the android 12 or the moto phones with it already have most of the dynamic island features just its in the notification bar and not in the pun hole or notch  like the mic indication or switching music and shi

Damn that intro man Editing god
some say maizu and xiaomi got it already

Apples decision not to upgrade the regular 14s silicon is such a weird choice yes I know the difference in performance isnt anything crazy but this decision makes them look like cheating

Yes Apple will copy it for the iPhone 15

I think this video could have been 15 mins long and lately it feels like you keep dragging some basic points way too much
I guess they waited for that 1hz refresh rate to enable the always on display so its doesnt eat the battery
How its look situation about charging The power of charging gets change to more like 30 or 35 watts in wired cabel

Hi bro do you know of ios 16 lockscreen beade available on ipad
Marques Brownlee plays Jidion really well
I think Jerry Rig Everything will test that all 
I really want the abilities to customize my icons and charge my watch on the back of the phone The dynamic island wouldve been great for me but this phone is not worth the switch for me OH and get rid of the dock or let us make it 100 transparent Its not clean looking anymore That crap is old move on
With the always on they should of just dimmed the whole screen fully except the dateclock then any notifications show too
Its like apple is preparing us to go to Marsheheheheh
The esim has guaranteed I wont upgrade I have a work phone They always give me a way out of date iPhone I buy new ones and just swap the SIM card Now I cant do that Guess Ill be going Samsung
Oh my god its mark ass Brownlee 
still no usbc even with eu legislation

people want stuff to be on iPhone like always on etc but then we get it nobody is gonna use it"

I hate the pill so much I upgraded to the 13 pro max because I dont like it that much Ive always preferred a notch to the hole punch
Guys if you watch these vids just remember they give you all the specs But when u use them in person there mostly the same like when i had my 12 pro and switched to the 13 later on there wasnt any changes all tho there was faster downloads but it wasnt even a big thing to be happy about Plus the cameras still looked the same only a little bet more things to play with But to me it felt like i was using the same phone
And the battery

I have a 13 will only upgrade when they isnt any notch at all its the only main thing I find annoying and dislike
Count ny words  apple is going to get back next year and they will make the  120 hertz screen refresh rate a something like it was not available from 2020 
Are the fingerprints on the selfi camera with it
I have a question does iOS 16 includes call cancel button when the iPhone is locked 
BRO THREW SHADE AT DBRAND CASE
He completely just skipped Z Fold 4 and Flip 4 reviews Like Marques at least try to pretend that youre not THAT biased Just keep the money they paid you and play along with the awesomeness of Androids too bro lol
The moment he says I will also not be testing that 
yeait ll get copiedthe way apple copied the always on display in this model from others
WHY YOU ALWAYS TURN ON SUBTITLES IN YOUR VIDEOS IT IS SOOOO ANNOYING
The new color reminds me of Xperia 1IV purple color
It is probably that you can still touch the front camera and Face ID area since the touching component is at the most top layer of the screen which is complete instead of having the like holes
Imagine having to clean the front camera everytime you need to take a selfie because you keeping putting your fingers all over it
What is that widget Anyone knows

apple so you broke the nda
What an intro man
Marques Real question which color iphone 14 pro should i get should i get the purple because it might only be on the iphone 14 pro
The dynamic island is a cool feature but unfortunately it is a very bad user experience design because the notch is at the top of the phone its really hard to acces especially if your holding the phone with one hand So in my opinion its more a gimmick than a feature
Android brands on their way to introduce this notch with different names 
Simply amazing to listen to
At the end of the day the notch needs to go completely and no hole either It can happen
Why the price is only 999 usd while in France we have to pay 1329 1327 usd I know taxes are different but the difference wasnt that huge before
"Boo boomers parents

How is this Dynamic Island better than a simple drop down menu that the phones had for years To me it looks like it would get in a way more rather than being something useful
Honestly I love apple had iPhones since the 4s and upgraded about every 2 years now at the 13 but honestly I feel like they are just not worth upgrading anymore Kinda like since jobs died apple stopped being revolutionary idk
One of the best intros I have ever seen Fitting for the shiny new iPhone 14 pro
YouTube profile has the same hoodie 
since the keynote i cant stop thinking bout the dynamic islandits soooo good
imagine if they said we are bringing the touch bar to iPhone instead of dynamic island

I find it funny how people complain about the Dynamic Island Apple somehow managed to turn what we percieved as hinderance into a feature I find that smart Better if theyd have get rid of a notch entirely but at least now it does something useful The biggest deal breaker for me and the reason why I yet again wont go back to Apple Ive been on Android since iPhone X came out is the lack of USBC Maybe next year
bullshit nothing new
An excellent review of the new iPhone 14s with a great in depth look at the new bumped up cam on the pro max  Also hes not adverse to knocking  when hes not overly impressed which constitutes bravery in YT  reviewers but improves the review no end 
This phone is a flop
The small black gap in the island will be gone for the next iPhone We make the island  smaller 
1938 which phone does good astrophotography 
"Dynamic Island is BEAutiful 3 More power to apple engineers Cheers
Now the other companies will first criticize the Dynamic Island then they will friggin COPY it and then they will say that they android is better LOL"
Ok the multitasking features of the dynamic island are cool and all but its all the way at the top of the phone how many of you use your phone with two hands Or are doing the thumb reach again Seems like a bit of a wellimplemented gimmick
Wow that intro is on another level 
Would you go for pro or pro max
Loved the video Keep em coming
if only LG still made phones with replaceable batteries they were one of the last known brands to hold on to easily replaceable batteries I think the problem with LG is that they didnt really know what they were doing theyd try an idea and if it didnt work theyd just jump to the next

Its the animations attached to the dynamic island for me tho 
Hi
FunFact In Australia  the words Far Out is commonly used to express that you are surprised or when you really cant believe something So maybe thats what Apple meant
That car crash detection feature is interesting Im curious if therell be tons of false triggers if you hop on certain roller coasters
I see the dynamic island as the touch pad they did on the MacBook pro 16 that became redundant I dont see people using it that much
Yeah dynamic island is literally the worst name for any hardware addition ever I completely agree with you there and I laughed at the Apple presentation when Tim Cook said it Cringe
Dont let mr beast know about the car crash lol
Sick intro
those who think the 2000 nits peak is good think about from now on the display will burn faster and the phone in hot summer it will over heat faster this is gimmick be careful when you buy it  and with their stupid apple way with cooling their devices will throttle faster and you unlikely it hit that number or close to it MARK MY WORD YOU WILL REMEMBER IT
"S10 dynamic amoled 
iPhone 14 pro dynamic island 
Good one"
Wheres the review Discussing a bunch of features doesnt equal a review
This is why i switched to apple android will be always the first on features but not polished as what apple does
Ive heard its pretty common for the phones to think you were in a car crash if you were on a roller coaster
I really love it when the camera zooms in when hes spitting hard to digest facts  love this guy
Why would anyone copy it I mean smaller notch is already mainstream if someone wants such animation there are hundreds of launcher that does it in so much better way and also existed for couple of years
We are tired of your subtle discrimination MKBHD Its boring and stupid
What about a video in landscape with the island Surely that looks s h i t 
I see dogs I like
That smooth fade on transition of the AOD is on ios 16 like my iphone 12 does have that dark to bright transition when i unlock it
"Look at this graph

The new notch looks ugly
The car accident detection is not a sell for me people dont usually get into car accidents without other people around noticing This could shift the peoples behavior on witnessing an accident from OMG somebody call the emergency services to Ahg I know him hes got an iPhone 14 Pro hell be fine
The dynamic island is a great feature but wont touching that area a lot make the front camera dirty with smudges and fingerprints Youll have to always clean it before taking a selfie or any front video
"That is how expensive medical care is expensive in the US 

Literally the biggest tech YouTuber is not willing to unnecessarily call emergency medical services "
I would like to know how that Hasselblad handles astro photography
Dynamic Island is going to look even more outdated once the holepunch is effectively done away with on android phones
"I never understood always on display for what  That display is on when you dont need it  Its stupid on watches and phone either 
And about copying dynamic island  bro china is already finishing they copy paste everything they can"
One plus 8 pro had supersteady 4k 30fps 2 years ago I dont get why they havent put a reverse wireless charging Apple gets away easier than any android Yeah yeah ive heard the saying when apple does it they do it better but they were also first with fingerprint and then other brands made it better they had stereospeakers first i think and then they werent the best The iphone 4s had the best display and then it wasnt My point is they are not always late and do it best they do it sometimes first and others do it better too
Imagine tapping on the dynamic island and smudging your front camera every time
In Sweden will cost the Iphone 14 Pro Max 1 545  dollars Iphone 13 Pro Max was last year 1264 dollars Apple are sick
this video is blowing up
To me the dynamic island looks more like a gimmick than a real feature Visually its cool but from a usability point of view theres the issue of reachability you cant use it when using the phone with one hand which is most of the time and when you do use it youre gonna get smudges on your front camera meh

Im not happy about the esim only option If my phone breaks I like the freedom of being able to just swap my sim into another phone and keep moving This is a limitation that I find unnecessary
the transition from 13 to 14 does not feel like a whole new generation of phones but rather a new minor upgrade like an iphone 13s I really dont see a valid reason to upgrade from 13 to 14

Coming from an old Xs how do you switch beween the 3 lenses  how do you change shutter speeds
So the final take is  use your old phone Its not worth to upgrade
Apple does what Android has done since a long time ago and apple fan boys begin fawning over like its some frigging achievement 
"25hrs SOT after 85 Thats like a downgrade not an upgrade compare to a 1213 battery
I know its with the camera app and bad cell coverage but still very bad
Im sure you can get better battery life with regular 1413"

Been a Samsung fan all the way overlooking apple as Ive always felt it had fell behind in technology a little bit But I think this is the first time Ive been really impressed by an iPhone The notch feature has to be my favourite theyve smashed the UI here
i have an iphone 11 pro max and was honestly gonna upgrade up until i saw the phones they are nice of course but honestly just dont see a need for them right now so likely will wait one more year this will be the longest ive gone without upgrading but i just feel like phones are getting so good now that using them for 34 years is very easy to do might get a new battery put in my phone soon but thats about it thanks MKB

I think that future is on some android phones but can be moved aroundfor some reason I feel like Apple comes up with new futures that everyone else has enjoyed for yearsthey are just good at personalizing these futuresand fine tuning these futuresbut personallyand my personal opinionam not impressed
How about the battery
My apple watch regularly think I have crashed my bike when I ride MTB Its super hard to turn it off from calling emergency services while I ride down steep rocks trying to stay from crashing I hope they improved in this so it doesnt think you crashed the car when you didnt
That intro was crazy good My goodness
I just dont see the point in the Dynamic Island and as others have commented below its just another one Apples clever marketing of something that the rest of the mobile market is getting rid of entirely Under screen cameras FTW baby
LOL Samsung had always on display since 2016 Apple seriously behind
EMUI 12 had that for a while but it only works for certain system apps like calls It wraps around my Nova 5T punch hole and is interactive with smooth animations unfortunately it was not utilized further since each unit has a different notch design
You think itll let you connect to the sos satellite if youre trapped somewhere even if your iPhone has no cellular carrier and is used more as an iPod 
best review
No burning holes in pockets No rush to spend Nor cash to waste Thank you for your review
Apple give dynamic island for only pro variants because of the increased real estate prices on the island 
iOS 16 now shows battery percentage thats cool
Was this video shot on iPhone 14 Pro wow
If the iPhone 13 was the iPhone 12s the iPhone 14 is the iPhone 12ss
Intro sick 
Ok battery life is the only thing that draws me towards iPhone and now Im seeing that 4hrs screen time brought it to 15 Referring to 815
Can it take photos of the moon
Is there any burn in mitigation for the aod It seems hard to shift around pixel when it still lit up the whole display with the wallpaper
"Obviously itll be copied

 But I think the copied feature will be the esim"
Ill be getting the 14 Plus I have a 12 MINI which I really love but I wana treat myself this year 
yo  308 no way he just dropped the new iPhone 14 Pro on the floor and didnt event flinch twice ti pick it up lmaoo
Dynamic Island is only a usless animation  shortcut If they would add things like stopping the music or pausing the timer it would be nicer
The best in depth review Loved it
What about battery life 
the pro model costs 1630 dollars in India
i am using a samsung A70 how much difference do you thik i will get
I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max and shoot a lot of video in ProRes Its so painful pulling video off the Lighting port via USB 20 speeds Waiting until next year for USBC before upgrading Keeping my fingers crossed for at least 10Gbps transfer speeds Thunderbolt 4 would be even better
but i would say that android will go under display camera tech to its new to level before anyone perfectly copies the island
I love iPhone 14 pro but Im not able to buy it then why Im here 
the hoodie is dobe
Hello Which one would you prefer to get the iphone 14 or this one the galaxy s 22 ultra Hopefully you will answer my question Ill be thankful
If youre touching the island all the time that selfie camera gonna get so dirty xD
Apple are masters of polishing a turd
I was a SUCKER for the LG V series I had all of them Now Im stuck here with an iPhone like a scruuuuuub 
13S
"LG spoke the joke
Apple shouted it "
Tell me if hes not the best reviewer ever
Should i get this phone if i Have an iphone 8 Is it worth the 1000
im still on my iphone x tbh it works great serve me well i dont think i need it as much as i want it
they should have just made the whole top area back with the time and stuff in it and when you open an app up all the back goes away i think people are going to get a lot of fingerprints on the camera and have to constantly wipe it but other than that its ok
159 shoutout Jcole born sinner
Foldable phones are already a failure
The transitions are nuts
"LG did a lot of experiments but they failed to be consistent in delivering them
It also added more research and development costwhich ends up making their devices far more costlier"
That intro though
The pill cutout is more annoying than the notch 
I dont care for the pill it just a widget that you cant remove I feel like it will get old quick Hole punch and an active taskbar would have been better Front camera will be covered in fingerprints
you forgot to say that the island is showing when you connect the airpods 
That intro was smooth af
your intro is actually a lot better than apples presentation
0145 What are those widgets on your lockscreen
Wow a spotted lantern fly made it onto your video these bugs are  everywhere now Hopefully you managed to kill it I read they are harming the environment
1206 top right looks like he drop the phone
Love the black colou 
The iFixit guys are awesome I remember looking up their guides to figure out how to replace the battery on my Pixel 3A and it saved me from having to buy a new phone or having to pay a repair store
Marques Im not be testing that Brownlee 
They should create an Apple satellite for a good features If youre traveling around the world then I will buy the product but if not then Tesla pie phone is for me for star link
Is the phone heavy
Reichsflagge 
Full on 20Syl Episode
Love the Dynamic Island They took what was nothing but an obstruction before and turned it into a feature
Wow what a completely normal video Thanks for the watch
Where can I get the nice wallpaper
only thurree
Is it worth going for the 256GB model to get 4k ProRes even if you dont need the storage 
No input on the low light photography which they said was improved tremendously  Your only comment that there was no improvement what
"After a long time as NexusPixel owner and after trying the iPhone 13 Pro Max for some time I now understand that
1 Google lost their way Pixel 6 Pro was nice but it cannot beat other premium phones OS is not stable as before camera output with the new sensor is shit and it will take years to adjust the SW
2 iPhone is a smooth device built for idiots Toggle on or off thats it Cant believe people are paying for this shit This island bullshit is wayyyy worse than a punch hole camera as it takes area from you screen Apple spends time on things people dont care about and trying to sell it as the next best thing Such bullshit 
3 After using Samsung S22 Plus for a month now I realize its the best of all worlds Speed stability screen customization etc Samsung was shit before and it was horriblly sluggish but seems they went a long way since S78"
Giveaway please
As always overhyped apple product I got tricked by marketting into buying an Iphone 13 pro and had expectations for it to have the best camera on the market blame reviews that call it the camera king Turns out my two and half years old Huawei P40 pro has a much better camera its more than a little bit better Apple cameras have NOTHING going for them Even that much hyped cinematic mode is just marketting I do not hate apple Im just upset because I thought I was buying the best phone and turned out it isnt the best
Why dont you review 14pro max 
Dont look like much of a upgrade from the 13 pro
so this island will be fulled of fingerprints on top of the camera
Still the whitestsounding black guy after 10 yrs
did he just drop the phone
Is it me or you didnt talk about the battery
anyone wonder why mark likes the colour black
Great Video thanks  139 what widgets are on the Lock Screen here they look so clean
Can someone help me with the wallpaper please
I have an IPad to tear down
Clean hoodie 
Please no one copy the notch It looks so stupid Just do a hole punch like everyone else
"Apple users after getting iPhone 14 Pro
I am a island boy"
i didnt find out i was in a crash because i dont own an iphone 14
Awful implementation of the always on display   The dinamic island is just a big punch on the face to cover up the lack of innovation Apple want to innovate  Then provide full screen with under the screen camera   But to save costs they will never do it
The AOD is meh
this should be called iphone 11SSS
i love how Marques covered more about the phone and mrwhostheboss about the camera please always continue to speak in advance and bring out top content love it
before i watch this I know he like it a lot suckup
That intro thou 
hey bro love from Bangladesh
1322  LG was way ahead of its time Just like Nokia Too bad they lost the market
The quality of the video is incredible The focus when you hold the phone to show the camera when you hold the phone 1650 the transitions the intro man the intro  Awesome
Id pick a sweet Android over this overhyped piece of outdated tech any day
Honestly the one thing stopping me from going to that phone from my Pixel 4 is the lightning port I guess the price is also pretty unreasonable
Everyones front camera is just going to be covered in smudge
I started using always on display only when Xiaomi added option to activate it when you move the phone or touch the screen Im aware that it was not actually an always on feature any more but otherwise it was draining battery noticeably faster
How did yall get the iPhone 14 already Im hearing the pre orders wont ship out till October 20 around there is that true
Good review Looks like I will be keeping my Iphone 11 for another year I want something game changing not just slight upgrades to battery life performance and camera quality I thinkhope that the Iphone 15 will be something totally different
this is copied 
Watching on my iPhone 7
Wow that notch is massive and disgusting wtf
Tbh it would be a more worthwhile upgrade if the normal iPhone 14 is equipped with A16 chip and the 14 pro is equipped with a variation of M1 or M2 chip
What is the cube name mkbhd
Why does a part of the clock on lock screen does not hide behind the wallpaper when i apply wodgets
So basically dynamic island just gets some sort of splitscreen that android had for years okay
if you keep touchingswiping the dynamic island area over a year or more the camera glass will be blurry right
love from 
"This island thing is not a great idea Can you remember the Samsung s8 when the phone unlocked sensor was next to the camera Everyone went crazy saying its bad placement it a terrible idea Samsung are the devil 
Well now apple are tell you to touch the selfie camera and to be fair is harder to miss than the Samsung s8 and everyone is saying wow go apple you nailed it 
Im not a Samsung fan as such Im into all phones I just dont understand how whatever apple do they praised but any android makes are ridiculed for their ideas
Just a thought"
I still waiting for Closed all apps in multitasking 
That camera quality tho 
1104 My guy said connecting AirPods twice
Yikes My Pixel 6 Pro has a small punch hole but it DOESNT appear in screenshots And how can Apple still offer the same exterior styling 20W charging 6GB RAM and the same camera  display resolution as before and get away with it Why do Apples customers have such low expectations As for the camera the iPhone 13 Pro Max leaves every other phone cam FAR behind Too many people dont realise that phone screens are very flattering On my 2K display the difference between the iPhone Pro and my Pixel is HUGE Especially on portraits The Pixel image is coarse but barring that I prefer its photos
How and y would they copy dynamic island feature Apple did it to cover up the notch and use it in good way No other phones have notch now Soo
Did he talk about battery Huh
njir keren
I dont like what they did with only the pro having the newer processor if they repeat it next year Ill have to get one of the 15 Pro line but I dont give a flying fuck abt cameras
marques brownlee i m your big fan from india mumbaipls come to mumbai
The notch looks bad
That maybe you have a dbrand case on it was a bit gross The corporate advertising is going too far there
you are loosing my respect using these words
copy
I wonder how the satellite connectivity will go up against with what SpaceX and TMobile will have doing with their satellite connectivity with the Starlink Satellites
I always appreciate how honest are you Display have to be at the right level as camera is Congrats from Spain 
one day they will learn to make the camera array flush and have full screen no dot or notch
Definitely getting the iPhone 14 pro max
I am an iPhone user Although I can appreciate all that apple has done with the 14 pro max I decided to order Samsungs flip 4 Wow how I love this phone With all these new features Apple has I cant see myself go back to an iPhone after switching to a fold 4
Great review as always ONE thing I dont see people talking about noSIM tray is the inability to have dual sim anymore Am I wrong Can you use dual sim eSIM
Do we really need 50 new videos for just 4 new iphones which are clearly not a considerable upgrade on the previous gen
That dynamic island switching cant it be done like faster from the bottom of the screen by swiping it the way you want Like thats way more accessible and faster
This is the iPhone X all over again There are features and things that everyone is raving about that have been used before and that includes the dynamic island
Everything is good but no Sim tray Why 
Did you just admit to breaking an nda in the first few minutes of your video 
"A question ran in my mind 
using dynamic island wont it will smudge the front camera 
then when taking selfies we need to again wipe off 
and again it will smudge out when using dynamic island"
not having sim card tray is a deal breaker
What about iPhone 14 Knight Rider
Bro the battery   drain is due to iOS 160 i guess the iOS161 shall solve this drain problem
Ita crazy to her 20sylhocus pocusc2c in the videoD
if you own a modern iphone  X or newer and you buy this one youre an idiot and most likely oblivious to that fact
Loved the 14 Pro wish it had the USB Type C port unlike the one seen on iPads Does the iPhone 15 Pro going to come with it So would rather wait one more year till then
I am watching an iPhone review with Samsung ads
I chose the iPhone 5 THAT is my iPhone thank you Apple
The ugly notch never Micro SD never coming
"Hey
Is it worth buying iPhone 14 pro to be replaced with Canon camera as DSLR "
I dont want the dynamic island on my androidunder display camera is the way But it does look cool
This dynamic island is not really new Theyre just extending the notch with displays When samsung did the pill shape notch on s10 they also introduced the notificationthat pops and stretches  at the top of the screen Apple just added that notification pop and stretch to their pill shape notch Its not really innovative
Wheres the wallpaper from
I think the dynamic island is more similar to webOS notification area than LGs thing in both the way it works and it animates
Car crash detection in iPhone is a small step for Apple to make its way in having its own car ie iCar whatever it might be call later on
Im still waiting for tie color
its just a notification area its just clever that theyve used the camera cut out with those movements and motions its new but not that impressive
"Apple introduced SOS via satellite
Future Asian parents We had to use that feature every day"
"Dynamic island is a gimmick i just pull down the curtain from anywhere on my phone and my timers music info and stuff are there

What makes a swipe and a tap so different

I would just be annoyed  if i listen to music and i all the time need to be distracted by the app showing around the dynamic island

These phones cost more than the most expensive phones on the market and sure the phones are good and all but is a pro max worth 1650 in my country for the cheapest version Heck no"
guys i have an iphone 11 pro i got 2 years ago is it worth an upgrade or not still not sure
Bring back my popup camera
Im still waiting for the Fold 4  Flip 4 review
Was that the old Mac Pro trash can as a pot at 1502 
Disagree with grabbing a sum when travelling Theres plenty of esim travel options that are really slick to get data when abroad whilst keeping the same number airalo for example Much more convenient than taking your existing sim out possible risk of losing than going to a store to buy a local sim and then not having same number
Caught myself not enjoying the intro so watched it again
You cant say apple copied LG Its totally different stuff man 14 Pro doesnt have that much of multitasking like the V10 Maybe some 20 might be Sam but definitely not the same
E sim 
Apple has increased the prices of new iPhones by 25 in the EU As much as I like apple I hope this will come back to bite them as now the regular iPhone 14 starts at 999 which equates to 999 as the Euro and the Dollar are about 11 rn Apple is literally ripping of european customers for absolutely no reason whatsoever And judging by how few stock was dedicated to Europe Delivery times are OctoberNovember by now I dont think they want to sell many devices here either
"Mentioning that apple spent 33 of the Sept event talking about the cameras and then starting the camera segment at 1333 exactly and spending about 33 of the video on it 
Nice one Marques"
TMobile is collaborating with SpaceX to give that kind of satellite to phone access to every user of the network for no price so soon every phone will have that SOS  feature
I am getting this phone Its just a phone that I want
so basically ur gonna have a bigger notch than older iphones when u r running music in the background anfd u r editing a pic in galary for instance
Dynamic island Ha who wants to reach to the top of the phone all the time Especially on the larger model
Apple wont switch to Type C until they actually change their design Theyve already purchasedhad molds built for the lightning They need to get their moneys worth out of themuse them all up before switching to USBC Was never about them being proprietary maybe in the beginning But right now they need to work through what theyve already committed to purchased
"Marques putting it across in a different manner this time  instead of so I have been using this phone for a while now

Ps Love the channel since as long as I can remember"
ill just wait for the iphone 15
1023 Oh I thought they wanted the clamp to be like hidden in the back LOL
still no usb clol
740 What is this phone name
Great review I think Ill stick with my iPhone 11 Pro Max for now Its still kicking on and this still doesnt feel like enough of a change to upgrade Really hoping the next version has a USBC port now that the rules are changing in the UK
No it will not give you faster shutter speeds the aperture is f18 down from f15 though true it will give better low light performance as the equivalent true in physical terms aperture is larger
All in all Im jus glad you didnt mention the name of that notch more than 3 times Any more than that and I wouldve lost my sht   soo yh thanks and kudos
Am i the only one not impressed by this island thing
First when I heard that shitty name called dynamic island theyre not that too intelligent after all 
If the 15 pro finally gets usbc and 8k video while giving us the option to go up to at least 2tb of storage itll be literally perfect We wont ever need anything else
"I had this dynamic island feature on my LG V20 6 years ago 
Shout out to LG innovation efforts and may they RIP"
I like that I wouldnt have to clean out the speaker area where my ear lands it can build up in there so yeah its a plus for me
Give me that wallpaper
"Man 30fps cinematic mode was available on last years regular iPhone 13 as well
And you can watch your iPhone 13 review video from 1140 to remember that 30fps is not a new feature"
is it just me or the editing is a bit odd the transitions between the sections feel completely off
Well what I say about iPhone 14 Pro Sometimes I am Speechless For Kind of Technology And Machinery Such A Phenomenal Would like to See More in depth Review Specially For Just Camera and Video
so Im guessing the s22 ultra dosent exist anymore
Hey Marques I Wanted to know if the Ultra Wide Cameras on the Iphone 14 pro is a down Grade from the Iphone 13 pro cos the 13 pro had a better aperture than the one on 14 pro as mentioned on their own website so is that true
Wonder how it will handle rollercoasters with frantic stop start g forces
LG V Series  RIP
But u didnt tell about the battery life 
Maybe he is moving to todoist from Ticktick
Maybe you can talk about the difference the island makes to the user experience by comparing the 14 and 14 pro
"Seriously how am I supposed to find the intro track The guy has hundreds of videos dating back 16 YEARS 
Does anyone have this"
well this is as close as were getting to getting rid of the notch the pill still looks like an improvement either way at least
"I Am Youtuber

Nice Video "
it kinda seems like the 14 pro is more like a 13s pro update
Fun fact  you got a fact wrong  historically the the Always on Display was craeated by Nokia which debuted on the Nokia N70 using TFT display but used more and commonly known with N8 and Symbian devices  Perhaps you are referring to the first device you tested with AOD
Nice wallpaper  can you share it
Useless feature will be ditched once cameras and sensor go under the screen
Question does the 14 pro have Lidar   If yes does it work well   Like Scanning rooms or AR    and keep up the good work thomas
This dude is the best reviewer in the history of reviewing no doubt
After dropping the phone I was like why Why to do it Dont
Apple will never be as good as Samsung
You cant see a video without the disturbing island right Nobody seems to talk about that
So true lol LG did do it first
If I had a Nickelback for every time I 1403
Does any one have this wallpaper
Yo Hasselblad x2d 100c
"Stop the presses 
Something that Apple designed will be copied "
look at this graph  caught that
"MKBHD  Im not going to be testing that 
Me turning off the video 
Me coming back resuming the playback 
MKBHD Im not going to be testing that either
Me shutting down the laptop 

Thumbs up if you wanna see Marquess testing satellite connectivity "
Dynamic Island seems more to be a what can we do with this hardware restrain thing than a what can we add to our phones but yet its a nice idea Car crash detection finally it might help people know about this feature which was on Pixels for a moment but not yet on every Android phone maybe itll help Google to render it available via GApps on every compatible Android phone Instead of a virtual sim I would have hoped for an under the screen invisible notchcutout Maybe the deletion of the sim rack will allow to add more feature in next generations of iPhone but iPhone 14 gives me a taste of between two generations smartphone more than a revolutionary smartphone compared to what was modifiedadded when Apple launched its own chipsets Dont misunderstand my comment Its neither a Apple fanboy nor a Apple hater comment just a tech entusiast comment 
A lot of novice hikers can use that satellite future when they get lost
Youve used this intro soundtrack before Its sooo good
I like it
I like how he points out the truth behind the curtain 
That comparison between the 12 megapixel and the 48 raw at 1700 is absolutely impressive
What app is the calender widget on the lockscreen it looks pretty dope and minimalistic
Can the iPhone 14 shoot 4k cinematic in Prores not normal in Prores or cinematic in std video codec but cinematic in Prores
What I want to know is how Marques got the month dot calendar widget on his lock screen
Im a little concerned with the way your subscribers keep dropping each day The education on this channel is great but please make it more fun and also keep a close eye on your competitors
951 
140 where can i find the calendar widget like that
Ive turned off my always on display on my watch I dont need it showing any info if am not looking at it anyways
Hey I recently bought the iPhone 13 say like a month back Should I upgrade to 14ProMax within 6 months or should I keep using this as my primary phone  Is there anything major in 14ProMax which I might miss if I keep using my 13   thanks
Yooo I saw you were bumping born sinner
Look at this graph gave me a little chuckle
The Alwayson Display doesnt really make sense in this Apple way The screen needs to be 100 off except the pixels used to display the clock The eSIM issue will only affect the US market as you guys went CDMA  the rest of the world doesnt care about this feature and Apple will be smart enough to keep it for the rest of the world as they cant afford to lose more market share vs anything that comes with Android For all you fanatics about Apple products  enjoy having more data about yourself sold to someone dont be fooled about the new sensors designed to save your life  bullshit theyre interested strictly how to make more money off you I really hope that the dynamic island doesnt make it to Android  theres a perfectly good place for background apps already
No one gives a shit if someone has the newest IPhone these days
My first  experience  buying a Apple on market place It was fake I am so sad
Love the USBC
I feel like we deserve to give Apple their credit for dynamic island Theres no denying it was a brilliant idea
always on is the worst feature on a phone its a death sentence for battery life and life span
Come this  intros are crazy men
I might switch back to an iPhone if ever they bring back the physical SIM on iPhone 15
No SIM card tray I guess I will stick to my iPhone pro max
Hopefully i get the 14 Pro Max on saturday cant wait
link to that wallpaper pls thnx
The dynamic island looks like a great feature for those who have been using a phone with notch but I still think no cutout tear or single camera cutout notch
Currently have an iPhone XR is it worth splashing the extra  on the 14 pro or should I save some money and just get the 13 pro Camera is the only thing really drawing me to the 14 pro however I would only be using the camera as complete novice so not sure I would get the most out of it Or is the camera that much better that it would significantly improve my photos regardless Please help
Its not like everything else from iPhones wasnt copied  
Heres a couple of thoughts about what Apple have done this year  Making the US version of the iPhone esim only was clever in a couple of ways  The price in the US stayed the same but in the UK and other countries in Europe the price rose by as much as 200 dollars  Many people I know have bought the iPhone from the states through friends or other means  Cant do that this year meaning UK and Europeans must pay the higher prices if they want to upgrade their iPhone  The Apple watch Ultra is also 1000 Euro in Germany versus 799 dollars in the US  Also do you think the reason the iPad OS has been pushed till October is because Apple are planning to release a new iPad of some sort
Even Samsung had this feature when you face unlock opena a camera and recieve a notification on S10 series
As always great review After watching this Just going to keep my 13 pro max Now Ill be upgrading to the Apple Watch Ultra
Dynamic Island You mean cleaning your front camera everysingle day with your thumb
Are we not gonna appreciate how damn AMAZING that intro was
Its crazy how they have us trained to spend 1k for some software improvements  medium level hardware improvements
What if you ride a rollecoaster Wouldnt the gforce tell the phone you have been in a crash
Stick with 13pro max not going to buy
i phone trash no flip or fold phones when are they going ot make 1
damn the views tho
if i do get an i phone 14 i would say the purple beats the black color any day 
Its cool and all but Ill wait for the 15 Im expecting astrophotography
I didnt like the pictures For some reason looks like a computer generated character for a PlayStation 5 or XSX Not quite fake but not quite real
Damn thats a nice wallpaper Where can I get that
It wont be copied There is nothing on android that huge that obstructive to be an anchor for it Cant imagine Samsung to make their cut out 5x bigger just for that gimmick 
Its even bigger than before you cannot seriously support this destruction of screen instead of a small bezel Absolutely insane Everyone has lost their mind

What is funny about the name Dynamic Island I am not native English speaker and it does not sounds that funny
LOL HE IS SOOOOO UNDERWHELMEDAJAHAHAHAHHA thing is that with apple you cannot say anything otherwise they put you on a blacklist so when taking them down u always have to say something amazing
Hello help me
"i like the way the notifications are on the bottom of the lock screen but then someone pointed out the dynamic island is at the top 
the dynamic island should be copied or something when i swipe up from the bottom into the app switcher in the space on the bottom of the screen"
Im just laughing  about the dynamic  island
The crash thing is great because a very popular guy from my hometown named Chris wrecked into a tree  tragically lost his life  it was hours before he was found  He was probably the best football player this town had ever seen  he had a full ride scholarship to college football
WHY ARE HIS INTROS ALWAYS BANGIN
Do you guys ship internationally from the mkbhd store
Still using AllttA song after all these years 
My 11pro max is getting pretty crusty and I want that 5G goodness Will most likely upgrade this year
Nice visuals
Whats the clock widget youve got on the lockscreen
In the country I live in facetime iMessage and new emergency feature are blocked Buying a low budget android phone can do more for me 
Maybe it will take some time for people to figure out that shortcuts arent meant to be on the top of the screen I highly doubt that the shortcut functions will be copied
Spends 7 mins on the camera section 
I really like the Hoodie but 65  WHY 
That V10 shoutout 
Its a shame that apple outpriced themself here in Sweden 14 pro starts at 1400 usd and thats a bit much
Jeez the intro went way to damn hard 
A few things I like about ios but still quite a few that I hate I also just dont like the feel in the hand from the flat metal edges Not comfortable though Im sure a case makes a big difference I just havent been impressed by any phones recently The folding ones are cool but priced too high and Im not convinced of their usefulness At least in the current form factors
Theres absolutely no difference between iPhone 13 and 14 so whats the point of it
The sad fact is that Apple copies Android too it can be proven  They have for a while
Just one very important question If my kid throws the phone from the stairs Will the fire department and police show up at my doorstep
Fun video as always Your review was much less harsh than the verges not that they didnt like it or didnt recommend it  but they basically framed it as a phone with rough edges that only early adopters should consider
In all honesty all phones are pretty much the same now with marginal differences in speed performance and features Doesnt matter what phone you get youll be happy with it be it Google Apple etc
I want my headphone jack back
"Every  Oooooh automatic crash detection   
Pixel 6  youre late as always "
LOOK AT THIS GRAPH 
Just because you fancily call it island doesnt really make it anything concrete
Its being copied now 
The purple color reflects like my Jumping Spider fangs where the light needs to hit just right to see the color  I love my girls Gypsy  Pepperoni  Alice  Wonderland
Nobody talks about 20w hyper charge 
The car crash detector on Pixel triggered when my flight landed Just bring it on the plane 
The intro made me want to buy the Iphone 14 Pro
What is that dotwidget on the home screen Is that something to do with the calendar
Would love to see which  major tech review youtuber will test the watch ultra deep diving to 100 meter
Nope its just a cutout in which everyone was doing anyway You will always get the clones but others wont Xiaomi might though Still dynamic island is garbage and just another gimmick from Apple Theres still a cutout so no ugly as Sony make best the best screen phones with no cutouts so Ill take that
Hope you killed that spotted lantern fly lol
Mark my words they will throw away this dynamic bullshit  all screen  Hahahaha
One thing I havent seen anyone mention is you will NOT be able to take advantage of all the new camera resolution megapixel etc features even on the Pro or Pro Max phones if you go for the 128GB models So be aware and keep that in mind
No No one is going to copy this in 18 months brother Only 3rd party moders will play with it But trust me your prediction is not going to age like fine wine no one is making the DI or similar out of their box
The dynamic island would be better if the screen had no cutouts
When apple does something they do it better
1808 really had me thinking something else 
 I would know  I died 
Thank you
iFixit sponsoring Marques Apple video lmao
Double tap to wake and double tap to lock is one of the most significant contribution to world from LG 
Im going with the iPhone 14 pro Im actually upgrading from an s10plus Great phone but I havent had an iPhone since the X so Im pretty excited
Always love when he uses Disarm for his intro
The ESim is a deal breaker for me Cause I always travel outside the country So they might charge me for roaming international fees now instead of me buying an open line iPhone that works with any SIM card even outside the US
What an innovation 
Hai intros stay the best

Are you seriously saying that a feature that encourages you to smear your selfie camera with your finger as you prod and poke the dynamic island  is a good idea   soon to come  the new microfibre iCloth
Is it really a good thing that youll be tapping on your selfie cam all the time Seems like youll get finger prints on it
Can someone tell me the calendar app he is using for his homescreen widget
Marques and arun timing their videos at the same time so viewers get confused
Hope your knee is ok Marques
Im not an apple fanboy although I appreciate what they do but the dynamic island is absolute genius when I saw it during the presentation last week it struck me as easily the greatest UI based software implementation on phones in years its so useless and unnecessary but its brilliant at the same time It is truly Apple doing what Apple does best
Hopefully the iPhone 15 has USBC
Im just gonna continue calling it the notch
1000usd No its like 250usdyear cause you can amways sell your previous pro version
the intro parts are worth Oscars 
The dynamic island is cool I like it People are trashing it but its cool The camera bump thooooo I wont buy the phone for that I am fine with my 12 pro max lol that camera bump is terrifying even in the name of camera quality
Nice Dynamic Island styled intro 
Hi sir MARQUES BROWNLEE Sir can i get one of your used phone i know this is a very big favor i hope you can read my comment thank you sir
The milk men just released new milk
Dynamic Island thats a hard pill to swallow I dont understand the UI decision as it will be for most a two handed feature and it is visually limiting the screen estate Yes its cool and working as expected from Apple but if I cant comfortably reach the Island even on the Pro with one hand this feature is not something that is influencing my buying or upgrading decision Lets see what Apple is coming up with next year As always great content thank you for sharing your thoughts
Soo people who own the 14pro max when you use youre phone in one hand can you reach out to dynamic island with you hand
Im going to preorder the iPhone 14 pro max Crash detection and calls emergency services That is freaking awesome This phone is awesome I am so jealous of you right now having the iPhone 14 Pro Max in your hand lol dammit
Lmao Samsung is getting closer to eliminating the camera lens from being visible through the display while Apple users are just happy about an island in their display This is ridiculous Always on display isnt new This is an old feature Apple is so far behind and charge top dollar for old technology Show me an iPhone user and Ill show you someone with a mental illness 
All of this i still probably wont be able to get myself out of a damn group text
And theyre using Gifted Parker color song  to market it Pretty nice
I hope they can make this phone in a different country Im tired of it being made in China Why dont they give the rights to Japan building the iPhone 14 over there in Japan where the iPhone will never misspell
Nobody gonna talk about how Marques was bout to click install on ANOTHER task app 
imagine being so bad with technology you bought an iPhone
Love the camera in iPhones I know what youre talking about dark skin exposure effect but its still much better than other phones Ive tried 
I still love my Verizon iPhones 12 Pro Max I still did not upgrade to the iPhone 13 Pro Max but Im going to upgrade to the iPhone 14 pro max one terabyte  I hope they have it and 8K display
Im sorry but these title slides arent good They arent reminiscent of the MKBHD brand at all
"how are they going to test it simple cue in Buster the crash test mascot from a certain series from Discovery networks

what I would want in the iPadOS is to flip the multi task 3 dots into something none intrusive in screenshots  especially for apps that was VERY VERY dated"
Reason why we didnt get 8K video it will be on the 15 Pro next year when we get Type C and lorded like its a big new thing as apple always does
I wanna see the stabilization comparison to Samsungs super steady mode
The dynamic island is similar to customizable edge panel in Samsung galaxy S series I prefer how Samsung put it at the side and the notification can be animated and customized still works on the top
The intro is really amazing
Here in India iPhone 14 pro cost twice the price of samsung z flip 4 so I think its not worth it
"Love your videos and others just hate when yall bring up fact well so and so had had it first LG V10 had a thing like it horrible implementation Fine Kyocera Echo dual screen before a foldhorrible When its done right no need to shoot a negative every time

When next years Tesla comes out I wont hear oh but we had wheels on a car before already blah blah not exact but you get the idea just stop Apple banged out a good use for the notch first meanwhile samsung banged out the useful dual screen and tesla banged out the useful electric car Negative 3 second rants about something irrelevant to the things you review lately I have been watching you less all over 3 seconds of useless tid bits But hey im just  1  viewer"
Im so glad that you have mentioned LG in this video Rest in peace LG Mobile department
Its a great innovation given the fact that Iphone need bigger cut out for face id Android fans can mock Apple for its big notch over their fancy in display or punch hole but it just highlighted the inability of others smartphone brands to create a secure face scanning tech For me who using samsung I am impressed by Apples products No wonder they sold the most every single year Who need a foldable when a slab phones can do things like this Good job Apple
Anyone know what widget he has on the left the dots
Apple or Samsung

Hey MAC

Explains the 36K downvotes
With that kind of always on display is it more likely the oled screen will burn cause displayed same picture for a long time
bruh that is the copy the s10 from 2 years ago had that
the biggest fraudment of the year iPhone 14
i ran with my pixel 6 in my hand and came to an abrupt stop it asked if i was in a car accident
You havent talked about the battery life
To test out the crash feature taking it on a roller coaster ride and seeing if that would trigger it Also would be a fun day for you and the team to test
Oh the smudges on the front facing cameras after DI usage
That Hasselblad X2D flex tho 
I think the 14 pro is a decent iterative update No 8k video and no improvements to the telephoto lens is kind of a bummer I really like the dynamic island  and I actually like the name  I think Apple should put in a toggle as to what happens with a tap vs long press on the dynamic island  that would solve a lot of potential usability issues very easily and quickly I hope next year we get either a sliding optical zoom or at least one additional telephoto camera Also usb c is a must I wonder if Apple has made sure that there are no burn in issues with their always on Lock Screen
me vibein with my iPhone 7 
Does using the DYNAMIC ISLAND not constantly put fingerprints on the front camera My main concern with the 14PM rn
The dynamic island is just Apples way to hide and get you to ignore their horrible notch
"Oh man 
iPhone 14
I just realized Ive been holding iPhone 7 since it came out and still going 
I just wish one day I could offer to buy this huge phone iPhone 14 Pro max "
"Im sorry if this is such a stupid question but isnt 6 GB really small Or am I just Silly
As for the AOD I havd a S10 and I like the AOD because I can customize the clock and AOD separately from the lock screen so kind of annoyed they would release the AOD and you cant even customize it Like Uhhh thats the only reason I even like the AOD is because Samsung makes it so customizable Idk just seems like a waste of creativity on Apples end but maybe thats just me who knows"
Im upgrading from iPhone X to the Pro Max which arrives tomorrow this is a big upgrade for me  Its been a great phone
Hope your knee is doing better with PT 
This island is useless for people using one hand finger to operate things I have gestures on my Android to open notificationsshortcuts panel With this island You have to use other hand
I have iPhone X so I will absolutely and definitely buy the iPhone 14 pro max 
What still sorta bugs me is the island not being a smaller notch for when youre watching videos its blocking or interrupting part of the video Sure a smaller notch would do that maybe but at least its like floating off I feel like if it was still on the edge they couldve just blacked out the corners and have uninterrupted full screen again for once
"Dynamic island baby
It should be named the island boy"
I just wish that Apple included 3D Touch Im gunna hold onto my Xs Max for a long time just because of that feature The trackpad mode on the keyboard is a huge thing for me
Lets start calling the Dynamic Island the DI
The fingerprints in the Dynamic Island once you interact with it especially in the camera area at 1300 mark Cleaning it would be a routine
Dynamic island is copy paste from lg v20
next year theyre introducing the super zoom
Ive always loved the always on display on my Pixels and I was excited for iPhone to finally get one  Really really disappointed they opted for a setup thats going to wreck battery compared to the more efficient Android approach
Great production quality lately awesome Intro
Apple Always on display shud be called as dim display
I think Born Sinner is the greatest fucking album
Anyone here upgrading to 14 pro from 11 pro My battery health is currently 77
I love the reflection of the Laowa probe lens in the intro 
In my country fold 4 256 is at the same price as 14 pro max 256
Great video as always but that Intro  shout out the team
What is with Motorola and you
Intro of the video looks so dope kind ah feels like better than Apples commercial
Brother 1 Trending 
I dont understand why people going gaga over that island thing but no one is talking that how it has effectively blocked the screen which is above it It is  pretty much useless when using vertically Moreover when using it horizontally for imagine you notifications appearing 90 imo screen should be measured below island
No sim slot no buy
Should I Go for Iphone 13 pro or iphone 14 plus  please suggest
The trouble with the island is that it actually takes up more screen space than what the notch did True it does these extra features but I bet you the average person if they had a choice between a 13 pro and 14 pro most people would choose the 13 just because its cheaper and theres more screen usage Personally what the island does is very gimmicky What prevents apple from implementing something similar with the existing notch style phones Why does there need to be a 18th inch gap between the top of the screen and the island This could have easily have been a notch moved up taller kept that same screen realestate that the 13 had but this feature actually takes up more room and gives less real estate at the top
why would you take a 8k video on a phone Why not buy a camera
MKBHD thinks he can walk in public and people wont notice a top tech tuber with an iPhone 14 
"Fucking americans are promoting iphone because apple giving him money
Example mkbhd"
My new Pro will be here on Friday Really looking forward to the new Desert Island notification feature
apple could truly give us the best phone ever made but they dont for money they slightly make everything better every year when they could make it to its potential right now
My focus was on the globe in the background I wanna get one haha
Can I just point out how sick Marques background wallpaper is Where can I find that
Like the notch android phone maker will copy this too
The Camera sold me sick of this 12mp BS for the main camera 
Marques goes hard fuck yea your move apple
That purple color looks dope
I remember the LGV10 I loved that phone I kept it for like 4 years 
I like this wallpaper How to download this wallpaper
Dynamic Island is just the same animation language as Siri Nothing new really
Still on 8 and aint changing for another year
Dynamic entry to the dynamic island Gai Sensei 2022 
Love your videos You give the best review compare to others
need that wallpaper
Talking that much about a widget  dont they have anything more to offer 
how will apple react to Tesla Pis expect price of 490 USD
For the AOD they are knowingly going back to advertise they have improved next year
I cant be the only one that was going nuts thinking I had a spec of dust on my phone screen while watching this cause of the white spec on the window behind him sat there for 2 minutes trying to wipe it off didnt notice it was in the video on his window till it changed frame and zoomed outward a little so it instantly changed location on my screen 
God forbid should Apple bring out a folding iPhone but if so I would not get it Those that had folding phones mainly samsungs from the distant past and where attracted by this fad and coolness back then would attest to their durability  Great content here btw as usual 
Apple just wants to be part of the Island boys 
"We will copy this

Should be Apples slogan at this point dude lmao"
Same old shit wheres the criticism So its clear apple bought you guys
Apple way feels like hammering
Im thinking how many cellphones do you have Maybe you could send me one Hahaha
I watched that intro like 5 times dude OMG
Look at this graph
Starting is the whole new level of commercial advertisement for Apple iPhone 14 pro Really impressive
Loved the intro
Im glad he said it If you have an 11 or newer its not really worth upgrading People will say but Im a photographer Well if your business relies on an iPhone camera I feel sorry for your customers
Before I comment visit LTT MKBHDATT store and pick up this cool underwater wristband for some reason 
Dynamic island is just like Glym on Nothing Phone 1 You will be excited for initial few days then just meh
A mod is already out for miui devices
1116 that font though 
Gosh dang that intro
The boring hoodie doesnt alleviate the hair situation lol
how to show that battery percentage
it is so beautiful i would like to buy one
Start of the video was awesome
This video didnt help me at all to make a purchase decision Quite vague
A little disappointed in the discussion of the camera My understanding from watching photography channels is that it isnt a real 48 megapixel sensor but is a quad bayer essentially a 12 megapixel sensor with four subpixels per pixel While this will improve things like low light performance theres a good chance we wont see much maybe any extra detail in the 48 megapixel images This is true of a lot of Android cameras as well
The app switching with a press is basically the recents button on the bottom of android phones
The more U touch camera glasses the worse it gets after times
If they did 8K video then they wouldnt have anything new next year Lol
I loved the sound of the seagulls around the dynamic island 
There is a reflection of camera bot on the phone display in the intro 014
Selfiecam will always be full of fingerprints because of dynamic island
fan boy review lol
you said connecting airpods twice lul
That real humble credit given to LG by you is what made my day Appreciated bro
After watching the complete video I just had one question Where is word innovation
"the dynamic is a good feature but is it practical

can u use it one handed can u reach it with your thumb
i dont think so"
Im little worried about the durability of screen protector because there will be a puncture on top with slim bezel but I like the Dynamic Island a lot more than the old ugly notch
Everyone is waiting on the usbc next year but everyone says that each year time and time again the still dont release it 
That Intro Though 
Ive almost saw 8 adds to complete this vdo thanks to marc
LG as usual pioneering the smartphone features Gosh i miss my LG V30 and LG mobiles  They were fun and wack mobiles
I just bought a 13 Pro a last month 
Edits just keep getting better
Your animations and transitions keep getting better and better
I wonder what the burn in level will be with the alwayson seeing that its OLED
Wtf YouTube so many long ads now that are unskippable
Man casually drop the 14 pro
Neat Its a little better than last years Next year it will be a little better
All good but does it come with charger 
My carrier gave me the option to trade my iPhone 11 for a iPhone 14 pro for 215 My iPhone 11 is still practically just as fast as the day i got it and completely undamaged Do you guys think its worth it
the always on display being that bright would be bad at night too
Can you show how the Dynamic Island works when the phone is positioned horizontally
Dynamic Island is cringiest and stupidest feature ever I was waiting for Apple to get rid of the notch to own an iPhone but this makes me want the notch instead If anything the animators and the graphic designers at Apple are true heroes Selling it to people only because how cool it looks and animates
I have used AoD on Android It looks fancy for few days but trust me it is very distracting and most of us will be turning it off soon
Always Honest Reviews
Might travel to dynamic island MKBHD gave us the exact location behind as well
Camera size looks wierd on that tiny phone
I have the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra While I dont think Ill switch I do wish Sammy would figure out how to seamlessly switch between cameras like iPhone 
So basically nothing really new   Got it  As always great video
Everyone already knows theborephone and its new silly features Why not make an review of the edge 30 ultra
I love how 2 or 3 years ago almost all iPhone users said that the Samsung Notch was ugly Now that apple did the exact same design its innovative good looking smh
1 trending nice
I love you but a review after only one day of use is not a review at all You need time to actually know and get used to the phone otherwise youre just telling All the new specs that come with the new iPhone they showed at the Apple event 
Satelittes will become the ultimate tracking grid
i waaaaant
I think people would be more surprised seeing Marques Brownlee in the flesh than him having iphone 14
"People should really just use google Fi that uses the esim way easier and automatically switches your carrier based on where you are at Never had a problem with it when I was overseas just really makes no sense to keep using a physical sim when google fi works in 100 countries
My fault 200 countries"
Marques you mentioned you shoot Autofocus videos in ProRes Id love to know your preferred method of getting the footage off the phone I have a Mac Studio so is AirDrop faster with the Apple silicon or is USB 2 really the best weve got Another idea I had is to use iCloud Drive but my upload isnt great
Great review as always Appreciate the shoutout to LG yes they were quite innovative I remember loving your LG Wing video That had such an interesting potential in it Maybe LG will make a come back and reinvigorate the phone world 
They should have named this the 13s they need to change to a 2 year release cycle Instead of yearly Even Steve jobs daughter made fun of them for releasing the same phone year after year
I hope soon Apple provides toggle button in control panel for location services

Are you switching to the Todoist app Cause if you do  we need an update on that during one of your podcasts episodes
The point about esim and international travel is a good one Just came back from Italy and needed to buy a local sim card This could be a problem
Will definitely be turning off the always on display had it on my galaxy s21 plus and hated it so I turned it off plus its a battery killer
I dont want the midscreen notification bar copied its stupid just bring the widgets to the regular notification bar and keep the camera cutouts to a bare minimum or make them go away

That LG reference was a low blow 
As always very honest and good review
Apple honest Marketing be like If you plan to have a car crash buy iPhone 14 prothats all we have new this year  the rest is no much different from last year
Apples Marketing department has replaced its engineering division its incentives has changed from innovating to sustaining quarterly profit growth
The dynamic island would be good on the bottom of the screen
Sooooo I should totally upgrade from my Samsung galaxy s20 to the iPhone 14 pro max

5 years from now Dynamic Island will be gone
And my mates say this upgrade is pretty much nothing what are they on about

Ill wait for 15"
Camera is not good wtf
That intro
Nope no notch of any kind on any phone I purchase No Oh No
its just a phone who cares All they do is a minor update to the device and people go crazy for it Im not picking on just Apple here Android is just a guilty The cameras are getting ridiculous
The intro is just nuts
For me someone who is slowly switching from samsungwindows to apple I might wait next year for the usbc I quite like my samsung s20 ultra as well it is a bit old now but I dont mind Hopefully the next macbook pros are of high quality
I just switched to iPhone from android and i have to say that the notification system in iPhone is garbage Apple should pin calls and messages always to the top When people call me the missed call notification gets lost between all the other notification Marquees call apple out about this Loool
"you know what iphone should do the apply way and copy other smartphones instead of coming out something new for themselves because they fail The dynamic island 
1 It has a larger cutout compared to iphone 13 notch and it is positioned slightly lower so it is more intrusive 
2 Now you have to reach out all the way to the top to tap the dynamic island now every single time you want to open or access an app Convenient I dont think so
3 You are definitely going to get more fingerprints on the notch area because you are going to tap it so many times 
4 Dynamic island UI dancing like nobody business is just irritating
5 Dynamic island is going to eat up battery too just like always on display

I think apple is trying to be innovative that is true but I dont think they have succeed"
one thing to note is that SpaceX is working with carriers currently tmobile to allow texting with their satellites without any subscription or special phones so even if you dont have the latest iPhone you will still be able to text for help from anywhere in the world without roaming
I dont know why none of the youtubers are talking about one of the biggest problem with dynamic island which is constant smudging of front camera with the fingerprints which is like a really major issue
Your to do list on that widget Floss hahahah love it totally approve cause Im a dentist
"Ill buy the pro max and Im changing from the SE 2020 so the hype is real 
Still not sure if space black or deep purple tho"
Love the video I like the new iPhone but you make this video in a good way to make me feel like I want to buy one The cost of one iPhone 14 pro is like 45 months of work in my country without spending the money so    maybe I will wait for pixel 7 or so to check some more The main feeling I need is to see how the phone holds in my hand because I get mad at it if it feels wrong I had a sharpedge phone Reno 6 and even if it is decent I gave it to my sister and I m currently using my second phone a budget one that has a more prominent screendisplay but feels better in my hand than the sharp edge one The thing with iPhone 14 pro is that its 6 inches so might be another story
Bro Apple compies nearly everyone else Dont play that they dont

My goodness some of the best editors in the game right here Awesome work
THE INTRO 
No true innovation in the phone industry in almost a decade Forget the form improve the antenna spend the RD on truly cutting edge tech If I am spending 15002000 it better be able to do what my desktop can do at this point
I wish these phone companies would make lower cost models by just having one camera with say 4 megapixels I am sure there are people out there that just use their phone for a phone and not camera junkies that feel the need to take photos of every minute of the day
Apple spent 723 mins on camera talk You spent 622 mins  Neat detail
ja
Liking the relatively new video asthetic Dynamic island would be the only thing which would convince me to get one of these

"Copied The general idea was copied by apple There are loads of 3rd party apps that have been doing notchpunch functionality on android for years now They just took it to the obvious next level  mainly because the cutout is so huge which is fine but lets not go attributing this invention to apple Same goes for crash detection pixel has had that for years
Good time for a reminder that even their most profitable thing the app store  was not apples invention it was created because of the huge outcry for it when they were coming out with the original iphone Ill give them the move to capacitive touch and things like kinetic scrolling those were great not sure if they were original but they were huge drivers imo to get the smartphone thing going big I was a big win ce and palm guy back then and I switched"
please make a video of features apple copid from Android
That intro was better than any apple commercial

"Ill be honest I think that Apple copied Samsung on this one Or at least got very inspired by one of the feature of One UI 41 Some Samsung apps like the timer will pop up as a pill shaped floating  Island to show the count down and a double tap will expand a bigger widget and a long press will open the full app

Apple had a great idea to integrate it with the selfie cutout but still

Edit I say this as an Apple fan who purchased an iPhone 14 Pro but this video seems much more Apple biased than usual"
Talk about the sound design on this video eh Eh 
Always releasing top notch stuff 
Ok Doesnt the Dynamic Island make your camera constantly smudged though from pressing on it

Marcus needs a reminder to floss Lol what kind of flossing is he up to

People forget that Apple made a thing called MagSafe and with all those accessories they want to maintain compatibility with newer phones which is probably why the form factor and by extension the external look hasnt changed I do think at some point it might restrict their design decisions though
Hardworking is the only one way of success
I dont love the transitions between sections of the video
That notch is like a birth mole that never goes away A moment of silence for those who still buy this 
When MKBHDs Intro on Dynamic Island  is cleaner that Apples Commercial 
"They took away the sim card tray 
Another problem for the industry to force on us"

Thousand dollar hole in the pocket 
How does the dynamic island work in landscape
I honestly still believe the Portrait mode on Iphone 7s is THE best I literally prefer it more than the 13 pro max
No one is confused anymore when a phone review does say anything about a phone call or sms And all do understand why people keeps upgrading or desire to have beautiful apple camera in their pocket
Should I upgrade my 13 max pro for the 14 max pro 
The main reason Apple made all US iphone 14 eSim only is to stop ppl from buying iphone from US and selling it oversea It has been a huge problems for many years considering ppl keep getting discounts here then reselling oversea for profit or worse reporting stolenlost for insurance replacement and reselling oversea Lastly the price difference for the new ip14 is larger than ever here vs oversea
My question is how is this going to work with screen protectors Like with the island moving is the screen protector going to just cover the island
Dynamic island is a gimmick lol smartphones are headed quickly towards all screendisplay phones lol
It must have been painful for him to say its again the camera king

Gosh u should make intro for apple like companies
Umm You might wanna wear rubber straps watch strap less
iPhone is slowly becoming android
Going from 7 to 14 pro max gonna take a while for me to get used to it lol
149  good marketing from apple as usual and thanks for slicing through it not much comment on the battery apart from the always on draining it so assume its same as 13
Important question for me does the reachability bring the island down as well so u could tap on it with one hand
Sick intro 
The phones which are available in America in 80000 INR and 90000 INR where peoples income is better than India the same phones are available in India in 130000 and 140000 it is very funny
 Here  comes  the  herd 
Not really a 48 gig camera  They just divided the pixels into a quad sensor so they are counting the 2 green one blue and one red as  4 pixels now which is wrong    That is just a quad sensor like every DSLR etc   they did need to do that though because that is what all the other manufactures are doing so it is marketing only
Before I watch any further the quality of the intro is off the charts
Looks like that Dynamic Island UI will make you touch and smudge your front camera whenever you interact with it 
Fingerprint on front camera because of  constantly touching the island
On an unrelated note the bug that mkhbd was filming at 1601 is a highly invasive bug that damages fruit crops It recently made its way to the tristate area after being first found in PA If you see them SQUISH THEM
Mkbhd What do you say reachability  dynamic island is useless where reachability is important  aspect with larger mobile screen 
Ill keep my 12 pro for now Just doesnt seem enough of a reason to update Im hoping the 15 pro next year will be something a bit more differentiated than previous generations Lets see
I wonder if riding amusement park rides like rollercoasters would trigger the car crash detection
Best review videos on YouTube
I dont think the Dynamic Island will be copied by most Android phones Android phones has moved away from the notches for a few years now I dont think they will sell a phone with a notch like that in 2022 just to implement the Dynamic Island feature
Great review gonna hold off on upgrading for one more year hoping for the typec and more substantial improvements next year
I Have the IPHONE 15 REVIEW
Youre so genuine with this phone review and opinions I am surprized Keep it up
So  what is the intro song called
Definitely not a worthy upgrade from my 13PM Hopefully the 15 comes with some revolutionary upgrades
I came here for frisbee
So much screen missing with that hole
Soo notch is much bigger now 
Lg v20 had dynamic island back in 2016
Wait did he just admit to breaking the NDA 
Still number 1lets gooo
i thought notification will appear in DI but its just slide down through it from the top
lol the always on display isnt even an always on display it just dims the screen instead of turning all the pixels off except for the info you need like Samsung started doing 7 years ago this is classic Apple just so they can announce that it fully turns off next year
Knowing they invested time into making this software solution for the notch just tells me it is there to stay for at least a few more generations But hey props to Apple even though Im an android user I think it is a pretty cool workaround for a hardware limitation through software
Why u dont lost your self or something an see if the emergency thin works
Empirical
touching the dynamic island is kinda off to me Youd get smudges on the camera and I dont want to clean it every now and then Its more convenient if switching apps is located on the bottom where your thumbs can easily reach it and less taxing wait Android have that before nvm
If iPhone 15 has USB Type C Ill get a pro max
Please share this wallpaper
I like the pill cut out not a apple or Samsung fan just like both
"So much good stuff

Still infuriatingly no USB C"
this thing already looks outdated yet im itching to get one my 12 mini could use longer battery life and bigger screen dammit Apple
The island is too far up to be useful for quick app switch Id prefer no pill a smaller cutout and a proper dock with dynamic island
"Hey can you do a video show casing number sync with a iphoneapple watch It may be called something totally different on apple devices But on Android devices its number syncsyncing a watch and phone so you can leave phone say at home and still take calls texts via the watch

I have a s22 ultra and watch 5 pro and for whatever reason number sync isnt working for me So Im debating on switching to apple products come tax time But need to know if its the same headache or if its smoother than what Im dealing with atm"
"Mkbhd iPhone is the camera king again
Best phone in 2022

Samsung folding in bitterness Jealousy as usual"
Still no USBc
Plz gift me a iPhone 13 please 
Bro the intro is Apple quality stg just the insane amount of effort gone into these videos makes them so fun to watch love your work so much man
wonder how the screen protector is gonna be
As expected everything about the Apple products is greatuntil you get to the battery seems like just another hurdle that will never be fully optimized
Always on display in iPhone is try to do different and ended up as disaster people already are struggling to reduce screen time  gonna make it worst overall really good upgrade
Im a Dynamic Island boy
do you recommend alway on display
"New title 1 iphone 14 pro wont notice
2 iphone 13 pro come in disguise with few more useless feature "
Great review Thank you
Dear MKBHD Ive been on this YouTube ride since you started And I wanted to thank you for bringing my favorite things to me every few days Life is short And you seem like a really stand up guy And your really good at what you do So thank you for bringing me happiness Just wish I could afford some of it
Damn these intros are one of the reasons why youre top tier
MKBHD has low selfesteem Raise them please
anyone knows that wallapaper
Marques broke the internet with this video
Android already have something very interactive as dynamic island which is called notification screen and notification trayhats off
Honestly as someone who works in the forest the satellite feature would be very useful
i dont like that 14 pro max doesnt have sim card tray no more I travel and now i cant take this iphone 14 pro max outside the USA I would have to get a internal plan charging roaming depending where i am going  Also i have the 13 pro max and it has the sim tray and esim i will get the iphone 14 pro max when they are available in store I am not rushing for it i just sad that i am tied to a esim and my carrier now People that do tech creatures that goes places its going to be hard for them so i think i am keeping my 13 pro max because watch i say it now iphone 15 all of them will have the new display and esim only phones watch i am calling it now the samething happen with iphone 10 and now all of them have it
P50 Pro Mate 50 Pro owns Iphone ez You just biased so you dont test all phones unless they give it to you free with bunch of green papers And eh hello i own for years better Nikon D with 14 f Zoom Tamron Phone pictures are EZ but theyll never compare to DSLR results its like heaven and earth but no one wants to edit they want pictures they can spam on internet immediately
This is the year I need to upgrade my iPhone 12 Pro to the 14 pro my AirPods Pro to the new ones and my Apple Watch to the Apple Watch ultra Good lord Im going to be broke and itll take months to accomplish 
  16      
No SIM slot is nuts They honestly think satellite phone access is important but a SIM slot isnt Get out of here
Bro take a rc car stick your phone and you can test it for crash
Im practically addicted to your channel I want an iphone coz of u
Damn jidion looking slimmer
Dynamic Island will go the way of MacBook touchbar mark my words
The real question is is even worth a upgrade or should you be happy and ok with what you have
This specialized spacial audio is actually super dope Big difference to me
I think this island is probably shit because most people use one hand to operate a phone and by the looks of oh Island I think it would be hard for people to reach their fingers to the top of the phone
The only iPhone that I would consider switching over from android honestly
is always on display make that screen shadow
At this point in 2022 we shouldnt even have visible front facing cameras islands etc
How come other companies didnt think of this for the camera hole These ideas are very simple yet very creative at the same time
The way u advertise dbrand case is brilliant
Just bought an iPhone 11 and Im most likely keeping it for at minimum 5 years But this was a great video though
Dynamic Island Only Apples UI and Marketing teams could get together and make a still bigger than everyone elses notch exciting and new I aint even mad they did a really good job
I have an iPhone SE and shes been good to me but shes smashed I want to focus more on camera when I get a new phone my SE is definitely not top tier on camera but Ive gotten some really good shots with it anyway Im absolutely sticking with Apple so I guess Ill get a pro max just because Ive never had enough money to get a brand new phone let alone the top one before
I just hope my 7plus survives 1 more year  I know it wont get iOS 16 but I understand iOS 15 will still receive updates Someone let me know if this is true  Otherwise Ill have to get the iPhone 14 Pro Max
When you guys designs screens and put words on the screen as a I designer it hurts when they dont align LR or centre justified  
And now the new PILL SHAPED CUTOUT looks more terrible than a notch while watching a video Thanks Apple
If this magic island was on the bottom multitasking would be a lot easier specially in 14 pro max
Can someone give the name of the wallpaper
love the dynamic island globe
So OLED display supposed to be notable Seems stupid to think that
Number one on trending
Got an iPhone 13 mini today because the iOS 16 update put my iPhone 11 in a boot loop even Apple genius couldnt help sad part is the drop is the 16th today the 14th I needed a phone TODAY yet the 13 14 cost the SAME exact price for me at TMobile  Im definitely not happy about this feels like a 5s in my hands honestly
September 15 2022 number 1on trending
Other brands are obviously waiting for the new iPhone release so they can brainstorm how to copy the new iPhone features
the snapdragon rg32 had this in 2010
"For those seeking confirmation bias skip to 1742
Youre welcome"
What are your default ios go to apps free
Im glad u mentioned the brightness because I just updated my phone and I put up the brightness and Im like why the hell is this so bright now Ik
The satellite thing was announced by TMobile and Android first
Where can i get this wallpaper 
Thanks for showing us the Wordle of the day 
Im sorry but Samsung takes 1st place this year Fold 4 is the top Dog
"Oh wow
Im so surprised you love everything about it Marques 
Im so surprised by that 
WoW everyone is so shocked 
Thank you for your amazing insight"
Sick Tesla surfboard bro
The INTRO WOW
Upgrading from my much loved 12 Pro Max this phone has been amazing but Im excited about that camera upgrade as well as 120hz screen Great content as always MKBHD 
i was planning on getting the iphone 13 pro is it still good or should i go with 1414 pro instead
Just worth mentioning be careful Paparazzi will now follow you during times of Apple releasing you beta devices hopefully not but not good to mention youve had thephone before release out in public Js
So how good this new camera system is as compared to best Pixel phones
As an Android phone this is one of the most impressive things Ive seen Apple do That dynamic island
They probably didnt do 8k because that 48MP isnt actually 48MP  Its literally still 12  Apple be finessing
Can someone direct me to this wallpaper he is using lmao
Whats the braille looking complication
can i have the old phone
Excellent review I was wondering about the always on and the effect on battery life Not you putting birds in the background after saying dynamic island tho I cackled
Famthe big fellas wanna support you on the clothing Help us out
Always love your genuine reviews this guy is never biased on Any brand Thats what is called creating a Brand not like other reviewers who simply change their review comments once a new model is released and they are paid
1116 dont forget connecting AirPods
Apple continuing their traditional of removing another staple of their iPhones Remember the headphone jack Then they removed the charger Now the sim tray Honestly I have zero interest in this Im firmly holding onto my iPhone 13 Mini
his intros are getting cool day by day
So Apple already copied Punch Hole AOD LTPO etc from Android is ok but making fun of Android will copy that dynamic island 
How do you put the calendar widget in the lock screen like that
He had this phone before June 11th 1check the date of the recordings 1131
Im sure someones said it but to beat a dead horse  why cant eSim physical media simply be replaced with a QRcode
Once apple swaps to type c I might swap to iphone I just cant give up the 1 cable life and I hate using Samsung phones still but theyre the least buggy of Android phones sold in us stores looking at you Google
Genuine review ever i watch 
So this is Iphone X
Just get rid of the notch the selfie cam itself is already pretty stupid add a cheap screen to the back so people can still take pictures
In India there is a lot of people so you dont need the car crash feature in India becouse you would be surrounded by the people
Lol that start was next level sarcastic
1323 lmao ifanboys
Quality video
go mark ass go mark ass go go
Can I purchase 
The intro 
From the starting this dude told us about what iphone is better than Android like texting and apple pay we all know that how Americans are blind behind the iphone becouse they are cheaper in their country
I still have an iPhone 7 Ill wait til they redefine that god aweful back camera design Good job on that notch
"Apple Network Using satellites for everything 

Maybe 23 years ahead"
Give me a Motorola they finally charged 1k for a phone
watching this review of 14 Pro in my SE 1st gen
Some YouTubers will probably test crash detection I have a feeling theres a certain screwdriver loving Canadian thats gonna test this
AIs takeover Well watch your child in case of an accident
Every youtuber is careful not to diss those garbage iphones for fear of losing american subscribers
1702  The phone should take a 42mp photo and export it to 12mp standard If without the PRORAW The result is sharper and more details than the output from 12mp straight as tested by another Youtuber
Dynamic island is just a enhanced version of what Samsung did years ago with edge display that had art work around the camera module and no one seems to have noticed
im an iphone xr user since late 2019 and im holding off till next year baby
Haha
1 on Trending Team MKBHD Great review 
What I want to know is what is going to happen with the iPhone that dont have the dynamic island do we have to purchase the pro models to get those features
"1021 Andrew from ads  Oh I thought they wanted the clamp to be like hidden in the back

Just incase you are wondering what that message was"
Leave that insect alone dude 
Man I just got the iPhone 11
Do we know if the US version has a bigger battery or something to take advantage of that extra space where the SIM card tray used to be
Copied like everything else
"Mkbhd makes better intro than apple 
011 "
4 hours of active screenyes its Apple for sure
1851 Cinematic Mode Now 30FPS 
Those cameras on the back of the phone are absolutely hideous
The 13 pro and pro Max should have gotten AOD
Just preorder the iPhone 14pro mainly because Verizon was giving me 800 for my iPhone 12 Hoping it lasts me 34 years
popup camera was better than this new pill notch
I wish I could afford that
always on display is so useless ahahah ive never use it
I was in a car accident last month and my iPhone 12 Pro and Apple Watch 6 detected the hard impact It was definitely helpful connecting me to SOS and notifying my emergency contacts
I feel like majority of iPhone users care more about status than functionality because theyre not using phones to their maximum capability as it is
Copy Lol
What was that one Lock Screen widget all the way to the left
The only YouTube video i watch on 4kThe guy puts so much effort into video makinggreat review as allways
Dynamic island wont but alwayson display also wont work on 13pm with ios16  Wth 
"Is someone else listening to that same Kanye West album these days  

645"
Me as an Android user dont know what hes talking about 
Oh god please dont copy that tacky dynamic island Android developers Notification bars do a fine job on their own and the app switcher at the bottom with gesture controls enabled in the latest versions of Android are already a better experience
"After Apple copied almost all features from Android cause they dont have no new ideas other than dynamic island  which is just a marketing trick not really a great feature 

Apple is afraid Android is going to copy them   Copy what of them  "
I use both OSs The Pixel AOD switches between dimming the display where you can still see wallpaper and other info and totally turning off the display and only keeping certain info presented Its probably for battery optimization I wish the new iPhone AOD was more flexible and customizable
Apple missed it could have just named it an iLand
Great review Im interested to see how the dynamic island evolves over time Apple implemented the Reachability feature to assist with accessing menu items at the top of the screen The dynamic island feature goes against that entirely So Im definitely interested to see how it evolves and how users feel about it after the honeymoon phase is over
Would like to see pixel 7 pro utilize the dynamic island concept
"android moved past weird notches so they dont need dynamic island tbh
might see something weird from other competition"
Can iphone pro 128 use video k4 and action live 
Whats that widget on his Lock Screen With the dots
Dont forget to floss yall

i have an xr 2018 so i think my mind will be boggled when i upgrade to a 14 pro max
Now every iphone camera needs to be cleaned every time someone needs to take a selfie
I dont think samsung will go to that dynamic island the pill is ugly still
Of course this is number one trending Mkbhd literally dictates Americas tech
This has been copied
Me still with my iPhone 6
Is the dynamic island better on the Pro Max
Doesnt the dynamic island mean there will be tons of finger prints on the front facing selfie camera Did you see any issues with that
Does sports score come up on the island or is that coming in a later  update 
Operating Dynamic Island notification will cause finger print marks on the front camera which will impact image qualities
Guess its time to upgrade my 11 to a 14 Pro
Same iPhone repackage again and again nothing new with minor changes
309 
I loved that intro id love to see the behind the sences on the studio channel
Im one who has an iPhone and galaxy and every now and then Ill switch the SIM card to the other phone to use it Sucks you wont be able to do that
Dynamic Island
that intro is fire
anyone knows what calendar widget is that on the thumbnail 
Dang the opening animations were sick AF Holy smokes
Fin
Who will be the brave soldier to test the crash detection with a car 
I will keep the 13 pro max maybe I will upgrade to the 15 or 16
1451 love the watch tan line
How much for the surfboard
Thanks for giving props to LG people forget that LG was the first to introduce many of the nowstandard features in phones As for the dynamic island i hate it Its ugly and it interferes with the screen more having a massive black pill in your screen Its a gimmick to cover up Apples lack of development to hide the notch
whats the little id badge beside the time on the iphone 14 pro 1202 minutes in
what a rip off
Apple doesnt let you do a lot if your own customization on their phones like Android phones
1 on trending props my guy keep up them banging reviews
Always on display  off Always
A big black hole on screen while watching videos
Bro like just switch to freaking USB C
I am so underwhelmed with the change this year I badly want to upgrade from my iPhone 11 but i think ill have to wait next year
pretty clutch  but ill not be testing that
I want to see Zack testing the crash detection feature
Wheres the bit on battery  Are you kidding whole review and no take on the battery 
Aaaah yes the 20syl intro is back
What happened to your knee bro
Jesus they made the notch even uglier wtf
Whats that lockdown widget A calendar
I thought Apple learned their lesson when they started putting ports back on the MacBooks   An all ESIM phone in 2022 is great goal but far too early as TMobile struggles to get an ESIM setup easily and still resorts to a physically SIM when all else fails  No thanks Apple
Theres nothing folding in half Im still yet to see any real enticement for a folding phone
Most of his merchandise be bullshit The hoodie kind of hard though
Awesome review Basically its still an iphone with iphone problems Overall I like the direction theyre going
14 pro max 1tb      Bought it but its still garbage because IOS is garbage  Great hardware but garbage system     IOS 16 is designed by infants or raccoons
"Excuse me that I am just wondering may we get the wallpaper file you use it on your iPhone 14 Pro in this video

Lol dude it has been copied already There is a theme available in Xiaomi phones in china theme store app that provides dynamic Island feature  Poor Apple
Is that a Tesla surfboard in the background Im intrigued
"The creativity is just something else on your channel enjoying every video I want the Iphone even more after watching your video honestly
Thanks keep it on"
Peep the dynamic island on the globe in the background
is anyone upgrading from a iphone 12 pro max
All iPhones look the same they never make real changes to them its a boring look
Great video Im still going to wait to upgrade from my 11 Pro Max
Tan Your Wrist Bro
I have a question to anyone that want to answer I have an IPhone 11 Pro and I want to change it for this new IPhone 14 Pro would youll recommend me do it Is it worth it or should I wait till next year to see if it worth the change I usually change my phone every 3 to 4 years
Im in looove with the Dynamic Island The old notch was so ugly Seeing the dynamic island wiggle when you tap it is so cute Im sold
What about the battery life
The iPhone 14 slightly changed the button placement so an iPhone 13 case wont fit SMH
rip dark sky
the only reason I go watch the video was the Intro part lol
el tokayo foo
8k video is not needed I dont even have an 8k tv and it would take a ton of space Im cool with 1080 or even 4k
that intro tho SHEESH amazing work
AND I STILL WONT BE USING LOL
iPhone 14 pro is all about Apples showboating of their creative problem solving skills They didnt do anything totally new but just made everything better with their heritage
To the person who is reading this dont give up on your YouTube channel I currently have 617 K Subscribers Using Only An Old IPhone 7 With 128 GB Keep going its gonna be better one day 
This dude never disappoint us when it comes to intro
Waiting for AirPods Pro 2nd gen review 
No Pro Motion
Anybody noticed a new style of editing Marques hired an editor 
I had to get a IPhone 13 because my 11Pro I couldnt call out anymore a tech from Apple tried to help me I wanted a 13Pro but this was at launch From what I see on the 14Pro the notch is a little smaller and lower than on the 13 I am going to Preorder
Yes I was thinking of the LG V10 and V20 when you were describing the dynamic islandand then you said it Dude
Did you get that spotted lantern fly
youre no1 trending
1743 thats all I wanted to hear Of all things worth upgrading from the X is the Camera  perhaps promotion  Everything else is pretty much meeh
I see you got the wordle from yesterday
Kudos to the editors for the fantastic intro and always creating such quality content
Esim cards  how are third world countries gonna work with this
You said connecting AirPods twice lol
Samsung s22 ultra already has the dynamic island feature and Ive been using it for months meanwhile playing games on my phone It sounds like Apple just copied what Samsung already implemented
Link for your WALLPAPER please 
Still no reliable back gesture forcing me to use two hands Then i stay with android
Nice 1 in trending nice
I never care about the always on display I wish they would added a 10x optical zoom instead
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
After 5 years Im retiring my iPhone 7 for the iPhone 14 Pro 
Outdated iphone
Top dock is easier to say
You have tons of smartphones but you dont use them give it to me so i can satisfy my urge and i cant affod this phone in my entire life please make your heart big 
Still rocking 12 pro I wonder if the 1516 pro will have USBC
Thats cool but for over 1000 we should atleast be able to get a charger imagine getting a tv or ps5 or Xbox or etc and not get any cables with it lol that goes to show you how they care about the customerjust so theyll be able to ship more iPhones to make more money and not add the extra weight when shipping smh lol gtfoh apple 
Paid reviews
I have a XR and was going to upgrade this year no matter what but the camera upgrade and the Isle of Dynamic really clinched my decision between 14 and 14 Pro Im still waiting for a new Coral iPhone though
Too much automation  good thing bad thing  I dont know I started with iPhone 13 pro Max and ended up at iPhone 13 Pro Max Done with it and back to Android
I think its not a notch and I also think that the idea is well executed theres no way around it if you want a great front screen camera on a phone to shoot quality front screen videos and selfies tik tok whatever the case may be I understand people want it gone but I dont really think they really want that since it would mean sacrifice that all together
why did you buy a black iPhone again if the best in the line is definitely purple
The thing about the island is that its at the top of the phone which will instantly make it a nuisance to use
Its mad how 48mp cameras have been around for 3 years already in android phones yet it takes Apple 3 years to milk their old tech
intro better than apple intro
As an American i love esim I bought an esim service as soon as my plane landed in Lisbon and got service a few minutes later
Am I crazy or has MKHB reached peak hair Itsperfect
Option 1 have a pill box cam and make it dynamic with smudges over the cameras and it makes the top part of the display useless for any content or option 2 advance the under display camera and you can have 100 real estate on the screen for whatever dynamic function you want
Thanks Marques i like your reviews and other YouTube efforts  wishing you the best
i not thing soI belive no any company will copy this dynamic island
their system aod would get burn in pretty damn soon compared to what android have
The eSIM is so annoying if you travel internationally and already invested in physical SIMs from countries you visit regularly I guess I have to drive to Canada
Yo ibwas going to check for the hoodie before he said anything that look is slick
wait a minute How come he gets to review the 14 Pro before the official release date 091622
323 Wait you said the microphone hears a loud noise Lmao I know you were just giving off examples but still 
I have no desire for an always on displayOf course if I had my way Apple would release a Nokia 6300 style brick running a pareddown iOS with iMessage and a decent single lens camera Id buy the crap out of that
the Always on Display is a feature active since 2009thanks to Nokia and the N86 Symbian and Apple finally adopt it 13 years later
I mean I hate to be this guy but android already had this built in their notifications center
Sorry apple but I dont want a even bigger notchlooks  like Im keeping my 13 pro max till next year
I thought apple would of made the cameras embedded into the frame and have a little screen on the backI think Im going to stick to me iPhone 13 pro
Apple is the worst performing company for past 5 years  no innovation only fan boys are making the company running otherwise  no one will buy them its nothing but pricy piece of metal with highly paid promotions
The dynamic island is a pretty neat feature I still prefer a display with no notch or cutout
LG Walked so everyone could run over them and forget they ever existed 
I cant wait to get mine on Friday Dynamic Island is the best idea Apple has come up with in years so clever and well executed Plus itll be nice to have more camera pixels I crop my photos a lot
Whered you get that Lock Screen background from
"I have a question I already ask this to ijustine yt vlog I was thinking before how vloggers will test the satellite and car crash features are they going to crash a real car 
And I have a Question would a car crash feature will function while there is a no signal will satellite and car crash feature collaborate to one another automatically once you crash your car on a place with no signal how"
I dont think this will be copied on Android since the hole punch is pretty much the standard there and its smaller than the island on the iPhone 14 Pro since theres no FaceID sensors to fit in there The island is a creative way to mitigate the size of the pill cutout but the hole punch is much smaller and therefore doesnt need anything like that
Yup Just like how they copied it from Honor phones
I see you listening to Kanye
Ah Yes The Dynamic Island back when LG did it It was a gimmick when Apple did it Its MAGIC 
Its 2000 india
That intro thohonestly just as good if not better than apples own marketing adswhich is saying something
I think there should be an option to change the pixels in between the dynamic islands
Why is Marques listenning french RAP song lmao
The opening of this video So great
So if I have an iPhone XS Max I should upgrade  
Always on display only on iPhone 14 what the F 
459 The utter disappointment in his face I would be the same too lol
Marques you need to work on your wrist tan line 
Which hasselblad was that
I guarantee no one will copy it
If I know anyone that would do a review before everyone got their iPhone 14 Pro is Marques He stays with the latest techs He is in a league of his own
Apple is reuse 13 series to 14 due to low quantity of chips thats what apple do RECYCLE
please subtitle indonesia all vlog utube thanks u
405 not as easy yet Theoretically it can be just as simple as creating an account in a website and scanning a QR code but carriers being stubborn as they are refuse to adopt that Maybe Apples push will force the market to shift as it has done before
eSIM wont be problem for international travel I just came from Europe and Brazil and Ive purchased eSIM service on my iPhone XR instead of using my carrier roaming service It worked very well In fact I think Apple adopting eSIM as a standard could make international travel use quite easier
wallpaper please 
Crash test can be done if u collaborate with Euro NCAP i guess Just send them the phone and put it inside the car they going to crash test See if theres any results
"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life   
 John 316
God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty 

We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sinrebellion against him 
We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts even if you dont believe in Jesus or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible you are still sinful and on your way to Hell But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins 

He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven

Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends
Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you believe in him as your Lord and Saviour and you shall be saved


May God Bless you all"
So glad the iPhone 14 Pro Max will be my first iPhone This phone is a game changer As a Samsung person for all my life up until this point I gotta hand it to Apple for making stability and ease of use a staple of their brand
I love the PixelBuds on the iPhone display lol
I just want flagship smartphone companies to bring back the notification LED indicator With colour customizability I miss that
still dont understand why always on display is not available on iphone 13 just apple being greedy
Funny to me that it is called an iPhone and yet you did not mention the quality of the phone calls or lack there of why is that
imagine going on a roller coaster and checking your phone and see We think youve been in a car crash
That island   naa too big for me to trod on   the upgrades OK  esim I wish they wouldnt be transition to this  Im a immigrant and untill my home country goes to esim and I have no choice Ill be sticking to my removable Sim phones so iphone 14 not for me
I dont understand always on display Aint that a giant burn in risk
the LG V10 is the real source of inspiration for this Dynamic Island7 years later
Spotted Lanternfly
Dark Sky is being discontinued on iPhone
The iphone is still boring even when Marques reviews it  I tried         the island is kind of cool though I noticed that on the commercial last week
LGV10 was one of my favorites despite all of its flaws
Should be called dynamic eyelid
On a slightly unrelated note hoodie szn is right around the corner
"This just shows that apple is not going to remove the notch for another 68 years maybe 
Dynamic Island being intuitive at the top of the phone is BS which is even harder to use with one hand"
Always on display Apple this has never been done before Definitely didnt copy anyone on this idea
how is his video number 1 on trending props to him tho
"Im on a Xs and really want to upgrade to the 14 pro
Buuuut Im still not over loosing 3d touch sorry but that was amazing and funny enough still fully supported on the Xs with iOS 16 and the potential forced switch to USBC next year make me wonder if I should just wait one more year"
Those flies are everywhere 1600
"Hay men  
You cannot see straight to your viewers 
It means your not sincere to video "
"Everybody Yo can we get a new feature on the iPhone the APPLE WAY

What calendar dot widget does he have on the Home Screen
1250 I do love to keep touching the glass in front of the selfie camera
Watching the close ups and seeing the fingerprints on the front facing camera while using dynamic island seems like it would be super annoying needing to clean that for pictures all the time Or people who dont care will just have fuzzyfoggy pictures regularly
Im just calling it the Island
I bet that if Apple made a new budget version with curved back instead of a boxy design it would totally get a lot of sales
thats a great video and its interesting

What he meant to say was that you can toggle the AOD however there IS customization because it follows whatever you set your lock screen as with your widgets etc
I wanna know what it does if if I through my phone out the window
"Lets put all Fingerprints on the  lens and clean it 1000 times a day
Apple always finds its own way to hide its flaws  And no one gonaa use it ever bcz of its placement at soo top Apple without any logic"
"Dynamic island is Apples way of battling the criticism of it still having a notchpill  hence they turned the tables around by flaunting their weakness by making it a feature its actually a great strategy Though the name sucks

Also yes we do understand its difficult for apple to reduce the notch because of face unlock"
My Apple Watch sometimes detects a fall when Im doing burpees technically is correct though
"If the satellite connecting function is supposed to be used in the dire scenario what about if the battery is also dead as its so dire
Apple has gradually geared itself in the trajectory away from everyday life which most people care about
What percentage of people will be put in a desperate situation say 001
Apple is generously giving away opportunities to other brands in the Android camp luckily Apple has its exclusive OS no competitors to share its market"
I offroad in high speed desert running and rock crawling so Im assuming that the phone detects when its connected to a car stereo and engages the crash detection feature and might be a double edged sword maybe it can be disabled I will definitely appreciate the satellite connectivity if Im ever stranded in a commonly cell phone dead zone areas of the wilderness
Dynamic IslandBaby What a terrible name  I love it 
Go run full speed into a wall and body slam into it Prolly set it off Better yet go ride your bike off of a ramp into a lake LOL
My all so YouTube please me
MKBHD A car may have a major redesign every 45 years and amongst those years there are minimal upgrades  Nobody bats an eye  Why do we hold phones to a standard where every release must be groundbreaking Is it because Apple makes a spectacle of their iterations
This is just an iphone 13s
ive had android phones in the past and i never used always on display feature nor will i use it on my new iphone
Do you think International model of the 14 will have a sim card slot
Wife and I have Samsung Note 20 Ultra 5Gs shes finally unfortunately switching to iPhone this year We used to be Apple fans back then till about the iPhone 6 but realized that it was really restrictive and boring to be on IOS so we moved to Samsung and hadnt looked back She wants iMessage and FaceTime capabilities only reason shes making the switch I am looking forward to the new Samsung S23 Ultra Cant wait to compare them side by side
Apple will end up removing the front camera at this rate they going on removing things
THE SCREEN AREA ISNT MORE USABLE JUST BECAUSE YOU MADE MORE OF THE SCREEN BLACK NEAR IT
Minor upgrades Should of called it the Iphone 13S pro
Kanye Graduation nice
Great video brother
That watch tan at 1815 is amazing nearly rivals mine
Im a island boy
18 month yesterday MIUI copy that
and HONESTLY call me crazy but drawing MORE attention to the dang camera is stupid  i legit would prefer they just do hole punch cameras 
This wont change the fact that I saw two blind people fighting and I said I support the one with a knife and they both ran
Apple is smart yes they are late when it comes to phone featurestechnologies but what they do is check out the features from their competitors and perfect it then release it for their phones Thats why their features always look better than android even though apple makes them 234 years later And thats what people love about iphones a smooth and lagfree experience imo
If you look at Apples biggest features its mostly ripoffs of things that Androids have had for years now  This dynamic island is a straight ripoff of what the LG V10 did first only LG did a horrible job of promoting it and making it a big deal  I do like that Apple is attempting to shrink the notch but cmon  How long will it take Apple to catch up to Android and give us a full screen with a tiny punch hole or no notch  Coming soon on iOS 21 the debut of no notch  My problem with Apple is that they literally have billions of dollars and could do much more innovation on their iPhones but they actively choose not to  So what you end up with is the same phone mostly each year with only minor variations  If Apple kept prices the same that would be more forgivable but they give you the same phone and actually increase prices  That shows you the frame of mind Apple is in and that their phones are nothing more than blatant cash grabs  Ill grant them that iOS is a well integrated ecosystem and their phones are well made with unbeatable updates  That still doesnt excuse them being lazy and not giving users the customization we deserve
basically save ur money 
Where can I get the wallpaper
You are great man and you actually listen to your fans and improve your videos and expand your audience even though you dont have to do that and thats true love and dedication man 
The dynamic island is stupid  making notifications black to hide the notch what My notification shade is already fricken black  what in the hell is apple smoking
I bought one but I am super not stoked about the esim  I just went to indonesia and this would have been a PITA
Loved how he just dropped the LG bomb and moved on ahaha
What is that pill notch brooo
When I was in videography school I was taught to never shoot 30fps always 24fps to make it cinematic
705 That smooth AOD to wallpaper transition is also Samsungs idea from S8 era 5 years ago They called it infinity wallpaper and it included an AOD style lock screen and wallpaper that had a similar smooth flow
 845 wow Marques really hate the naming for the feature Dynamic Island
Why is nobody talking about the issue of constantly tapping on the dynamic island and putting your fingerprints all over the selfie camera
I hope to god they fix that battery icon I hate seeing the number and it just being solid white If its on 5 it will still be solid white TRIGGERING
All these new features  please over 35 years old all the features
What about people that swap phones I use pixel and iPhone this no sim is a let down
"Question for Iphone 14 Pro

 Purple or Black

Also whats the difference of last year black and this year black color they look same color"
the problem with the dynamic island is too high for use with one hand since the inches are always increasing
Great review
So glad Spotify will work right away with the Dynamic Island
How long did you have the phone for before it was announced
"Here comes androids
Theyre here to copy it"
Dont get all the jokes on dynamic island name
Does the app Waze works on Dynamic island
"Dynamic island
  means two hands navigation not good when you have big phone
  finger prints all over the front camera  sensors
  no need to be pill like any notch can do that If it is convenient is this on other lineup"

And here I am with my Galaxy flip 4 that is infinitely better than iPhone

Still waiting for the day iPhones can take pics of the moon Im tired of just taking white dot pics

The bird sounds when he starts talking about the dynamic island As always impeccable level of detail Hats off to this guys
The lack of sim card tray sounds terrible for travel great point
I have a base 11 is this a worthy upgrade
Of course MKBHD will get a new iphone before they release it O
iPhone XSs also have all the new features from the update
How is the battery life compared to the 13 pro
"Ahhhh ifixit sponsored u guys

Love that there getting more attention now and that repairing your phone is being forced as an option to these disgustingly greedy coporations 

So get recked apple he got a repair sponsorship on your flagship phones video "
A really honest true review and therefore very much appreciated  Great content once again
Unrelated but I hope you killed the spotted lantern fly you were taking a picture of Its an incredibly invasive species that has ravaged the NE
Dynamic Island and Seagulls sound 
"I honestly think this years review fell short on quality and Marques looked tired and uninspired  

If you dont know what Im saying watch TheVerges review for the brilliant analysis of the dynamic island by Nilay and the energy in mrwhosetheboss camera comparison with Samsung 

This felt dull compared to what you normally put out"
Really wish theyd just remove the damn Face ID Its unnecessary as fuck That big ass cut out could be smaller and not so obvious
sick intro
"Cant deny dynamic island is a funny unnecessary name
Better call it top notch"
Give me that phn bro
Dynamic island seems a lot like the touchbar for the iPhone
The battery life of a phone is so important to me Now that this is becoming a major change in phone manufacturing these days gets me pumped up
"Your intro is another level
Always never let us down"
Times New Roman
I used to own an LG G4 as a middle schooler and no matter how many impressive phones I see I just cant get over how ahead of its time that phone was Couple features that have since been introduced to iPhones are the back of the phone taps front screen tap to wake up always on display default weather animations and the dynamic island and absolutely AMAZING camera quality as well Honestly as a South Korean myself kinda bummed that my childhood smartphone is never coming back
Dynamic island merch
I watched the intro twice it was so good
I got a samsung while watching this video
I actually hate the look of the pill shape notch but the animations for it looks amazing Its like a feature that belongs in an iPhone
12051210 is it intentional design that the other background app clocktimer doesnt reappear in the island when you click through to Spotify
Thats a big hole  cut out
Can you do a Hasselblad X2D Review
Should i change my 7 plus for this one
What an intro Bravo
 THIS IS WHATS INSIDE AN APPLE PHONE
Just for reference a normal 13 pro ios 155 waiting for untethered jb gets 4905 in geekbench and 15040 in compute Thats hilarious how they release a 13S and just call it 14 lol
332 Not having a SIM card tray sounds like a deal breaker What a terrible feature to lose Its hardly even a feature just one of the most major phone parts of the phone
And battery
Any day Americans stop buying iPhone that will be the end  of Apple and the refurbished products 
the front facing camera will be dirty with finger prints all the time
So if I take pictures or videos using the full 48mp with 128gb Im going to be out of space pretty quickly
Wordle enjoyer
I appreciate the two songs you were listening to Good choices
My s22 ultra still better than this 
148 No kidding Had to compare it with 3 generations before Oof
Is the pro max better than the pro in a manner thats significant enough to get a pro max rather than a pro
there is already in display cameras I doubt companies will go for a notch again
can dynamic island be turned off i feel that the dynamic island would be annoying to me
Now I want an LG V10 
Great job as always MKB But kill that red lantern fly
056 No surprise there
have money dont know how to spend then buy this new wine in old bottle
No sim tray really bums me out I am currently living  abroad and get amazing cell service at a fraction of the cost with a physical sim card The Esims exist here but are at least 25 more expensive Heres to hoping the market will push the prices down eventually but I am happy with my 13pro with the sim tray for the foreseeable future
I stay with my 13 pro max 
Lol you play audio as your first word too My man
The only thing to outshine the dynamic island is the intro showcasing it chefs kiss
Wait until februari See more review
The island is cute but the problem is that its at the top and that requires you to stretch your fingers higher I keep my important icons closer to the middle or bottom of the phone because its faster for me to reach there compared to up higher
Z Flp 4 please
I meanIm a sucker for the Dynamic Island wow Not going to run out and buy the phone but when my iPhone 11 kicks the dust Ive got something look forward too
Pixel phones have a similar feature for car crash detection Im not sure if the sensors and data needed for the algorithm to determine its a crash are the same as with the iphone but my pixel car crash will trigger every so often when riding on a scooter with phone on a mount and I hit some bumps or have to make a slightly abrupt stop Its dangerous in those situations because I find myself still riding but I have to cancel the false trigger otherwise it will call 911 Perhaps people could test this feature on a scooter or sorts
You prefer the pro over the pro max
What keyboard do you have
So now I know Marques test runs new iPhones prior to release just might keep on eye on him before apple events haha
The thing with always on display which is something that they can just change with updates is that its either always on or no always on Which is annoying by itself Android phones have a pickup mode which only turns on the essentials of the lock screen notifications time and date what youre listening to if you have something playing when you guessed it you pick it up I have found that I use the phone way less with pickup mode because I only unlock and use the phone if its necessary I would hope that iOS implements this and fixes the brightness issue to be environmentaware at the very least Just some very minor QoL changes that could persuade me to getting an iPhone as a secondary device instead of just running a DualSIM Android device
people will be copied but not for samsung maybe from china samsung for what that features because samsung never switch to face id system
Im glad the AOD can be turned off because I really think that would affect the battery despite what Apple said And honestly I dont care much for the AOD feature
I just want the new IOS without killing my phones battery Might be a reason for me to upgrade
Good job Apple you found a way to turn a negative into a positive No one wanted a giant notch but if you rebrand it as something else people will go nuts for it
But does reachability work with the island
Thanks for not using the word dope its a trigger word for me after many people I knew overdosing on dope
Taking pictures is gay
that camera is legen wait for it dary
the intro song sounds kind of the one thats on the iPhone Xs unboxing 
Im hoping US only eSIM will quickly come to Canada so that carriers are forced to adopt eSIM and I can ditch my physical SIM to have an extra SIM slot could be useful
That wallpaper  Does anyone know where i can find it But amazing video as usual
Excellent title sequence I absolutely knew you or maybe even Apple wouldve stylized it this way 
And yet a dynamic island still ruins full screen videos
What is the first widget he is using on lock screen

first I didnt think about the island but now when I see it in a hand of somebody it just looks ridiculous like if a android phone would have this iPhone users would make fun of it just like with the pixel 3 XLs notch
The Hoodie is  Insta cope for me for sure
Cant wait to see the android phones have the dynamic island D

Id think the next iPhone has 8k and type C port So they can claim the next phone is an upgrade  apple so funny about that stuff
Me watching with my iphone 8 ive been having for 4 years interesting
I ordered one then canceled it I have a 12 pro max and just couldnt justify upgrading yet
iPhone 1515 pro will be the real deal
will constant touching of the front camera affect selfie taking with all the fingerprints
Its crazy how this is just being recognized My Google Pixel 4 had that same crash detection feature I knew it worked when my phone was placed on the middle console and I came to a hard stop and my phone flew under the seat By the time I grabbed the phone I had three seconds before it automatically called for help It never did it outside of the car because it always detects when you are in a vehicle
The intro is getting even better than official Apple onesmy god Marques
Im waiting for the iPhone 13 to go on sale so that the prices of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 11 can drop so that I can get the iPhone 7
It feels like were not too far away from MKBHD team making actual smartphone ads
Nice Wordle yesterday MKBHD 
Touting the Always on display as some sort of a world breaking innovation has made them a joke Sad to see how pathetic this company has become From really innovating a decade ago to this
gonna be getting this soon as i can currently have a 12 ouch and just gotta say im actually a huge fan of how the display looks it just looks a lot more sleek and new which i love not sure how i feel about the whole sim card situation but i also said that about the home button and ive grown to be used to both having it and not having it so i feel like that may be the same kind of deal
me waiting for iphone 13 to drop  so iphone 12 price decreases iphone 11 price decreases then i can buy iphone 7 
I think this is just the start with the car crash apple will sell also a car so you can use that feature
"Everyone laughs and mocks on Apple before releasing iPhone

As soon as they released

EVERYONE SHUTS  some copies it 

Am I the only one whos noticing it"
Apple got to have these YouTubers on their payroll Making excuses for underwhelming and overcharged products smh Who is asking for these types of upgrades anyway  Dynamic Island smh lol
"I dont mean to be rude but I find the Dynamic Island to be pretty useless to me I dont think I would ever use it

Take for example playing music How is that different from pulling down the Notification and skippingpausing a song Like seriously I just feel like its on the way Like its distracting But that is just a me thing Its one of those thingd I would say Yeah thats coolbutI dont think I would ever use it honestly"
Just a few add ons to increase prices only reason I would get one is cause of the camera upgrade 
Where did you get that wallpaper I love it
can you listen to twitter spaces with dynamic island feature
I really dont like ios so I dont use iPhone but the satellite connectivity is pretty cool for someone like myself who lives in a rural town without much cell service
Whats the music at 127 
"apple must love to pay you TO dole out this BS  LOL
this phone is a joke the dynamic island is not really dynamic 1 its just a shortcut button to me and seeing as how all the notifications and same things will pop up at the bottom of your phone anyway its not impressive and to be even more unimpressed the a16 chip inside of it inside  isnt that much faster than the A15 GET OVER YOURSELVES"
Boy charge the phone
Ill say it Always a classy presentation Thnx
Ive had my Apple Watch since early 2020  The workout detection works flawlessly as you pointed out but Ive also never had it falsely detect that I was in an accident or seriously injured in some way  In late 2020 my wife and I were patiently waiting at an intersection in our car for some pedestrians to cross the street when a guy in a pickup truck made a left turn and hit us from the front  The Apple Watch worked perfectly and detected the impact  It then checked to make sure we were okay before proceeding with any emergency calls  I was able to cancel the call process because we werent hurt at all in the least  So those are my test results  I assume the iPhone 14 would work just as well if not better with all of the additional sensors
"Man iPhone 14 is this and that

Meanwhile iPhone 13 tell me about it "
Anyone know what that food was in the bowl of one of the sample pics he took It looked good
What if your in a rollercoaster
The blur from all the finger smudges on the front camera is gonna be crazy
1115 he said connecting air pods twice
So the dynamic island is basically a notification bar Very innovative
LG When we did the notch you all said it was bad Apple names the notch Dynamic Island and you all go crazy This is why I left and you guy will no longer get innovation
Isnt it risky to announce that you are using it in public during the embargo Or I guess Apple wouldnt want to lose MKBHD as a reviewer
I just upgraded from a XS Max to a 13 pro max last year and Im torn between upgrading to the 14 pro max What should I do I love the dynamic island and AOD 
"Dynamic Island only build dirt Island on front camera notch Fingerprints will destroy image quality
2 Its difficult to move on top of screen  We have sail through whole screen for reaching Island"
I just hope the eSim doesnt catch on to android seems like they can have a lot more control over your phone maybe Im just paranoid but just my opinion
A car crash will be a less sudden deceleration than a phone drop imo You have the cars crumple zone to slow the phone down vs a millimeter of case
You know who will copy first 
still a dead black space there lol
Here for the wallpaper Does anyone have a link
Get in a car crash and show us that feature works or not or how flawlessly it works lol 
Been rocking the iPhone X for 4 years now this seems like an appropriate upgrade
Samsung is better in every way
Well Im still okay with my IPhone SE 2020
 S22 Ultra still better no wonder Samsung mocks this company  Millennials with IPhone 13 will still upgrade for Always On Display and slightly better camera  
I have a Pixel 2xl right now Im looking for a phone thats best for filmmakers which is the best from Google vs Apple for a filmmaker Looking for the best in camera lens and features

"I feel like the whole long press to open widget or tap to open app is another interaction that would have been far nicer if theyd kept force touch A light press to open the widget with  a stronger press to open the app would feel far nicer 

Obviously I havent actually tried a 14 Pro yet so who knows it might feel perfectly fine without it"
as someone who has no problem with the pill or the notch the pill is 100 uglier but the software features are cool
For the pill not gonna call it dynamic island i feel like they did good on a tap to open the app hold to open widget because its more natural for what we know we already tap to open apps and we hold down to bring up the smaller menus so it makes sense at least to me
We dont have esim in the Caribbean so we have to get international version If they go this way they will cut off millions of users I will hold on to my 13 pro max for now

My Samsung phones had the notifications lighting and reminders on the hole punch since they launcher their first punhhole galaxy phone hahahahahaha

The satellite feature should have been on the Fall movie
You are are jcole fun
good luck with your knee physical therapy im in the same boat
So my issue with the island is smudges all on the front facing camera and if you do a lot of lets say selfie videos then youre going to constantly be cleaning it Thoughts
Does anyone know if the satellite feature allows us to message family and friends I have a garmin gps that can text anyone But would be nice to know of apple is doing something like this as well
Just wait a little bit for the s23 wich like every year is gonna be better than the latest iphone but if you need a new phone now iphone 14 pro max is the best on the market by far and for a 6 months wait definitly worth it
For the algorithm
Tbh the dynamic island reminds me of samsungs edge panel theyre both floating widgets to access apps Except with samsung you can turn it on or off
Am I the only one that notice they said the satellite is free for two year and nothing after that what do we have to pay for it what happens if your travelling or even just go into a dead zone with out knowing and happen to crash in the said dead zone and need to talk to a satellite will it just not allow you because you need to pay for it it seems a bit like a extra money feature
Promotion for the regular 15 next year please Apple
i love how honest and unbiased this guys reviews are
Excellent video I enjoyed it What I dont understand about the notchgonestrandingonanisland is how constantly using your finger to smudge the sensors and camera is good design Its kinda counterintuitive no
the prices for apple products are not worth it lol
I think dynamic Island wont be copied bcoz Android is moving to indisplay cameras
I actually had an LG V10 and a V20 specifically for the 2nd screen Those were the last phones I had before switching to iOS
As an Apple fantheyve lost all innovation
Can we just appreciate 22mins of Glorious Video

Well at least school fight videos are gonna be less shaky now

Best camera for god sake stop riding that apple D
Whered you get that wallpaper

Its garbage You obviously get paid by apple to make these videos
love ur vids bro i always watch your reviews before i buy any device thanks for being absolutely dope bro
So close but Ill hold off with my iPhone 11 Pro 8K even if used sparingly would have been great especially for landscapes that I do Dynamic Island is pretty clever though moving forward
Apples team are experts in bullshido

Love getting fingerprint on my front facing camera since they put the dynamic island on it
would you ever rock an iPhone without a case I hate cases but I hate throwing away AU1800 more
You can get a dual sim If you have 2 IMEIs w ATT for sure You can get another number so basically have 2 numbers on 1 phone
Can someone answer this for me   I have a 12 mini    I love my dynamic slowly disappearing reappearing bubble wallpaper  If I transfer my account to a new 14 will I be able to keep my old wall paper 
the bezels are dynamic shorelines
The team did killer on that island title in the intro
Great review as usual One note though 24p in Cinematic video mode was the new frame rate introduced with the iPhone 14pro not 30p The iPhone 13pro always had 30fps in Cinematic video mode In fact it would only shoot in 30p which was always kind of strange since it is called cinematic mode which would imply a 24p standard Now theyve finally added 24p and 4k to Cinematic videos which should make all of us filmmakers and wannabe filmmakers happy
The intro screamed dynamic island 
Hmm so u have it already ha  btw I felt down from scooter and my iphone went far from me and I took a 3 mins to recognize  will it call the emergency in this case But I was fine but was in shock 
MKBHD Yo dont leave me hanging man Ive watched you since your Google Glass days and Ive never asked a favor I gotta know what that lock screen calendar widget is
The eSim reminds me of the old days when I was on Verizon and they did not have SIM cards You activated the phone itself and if you wanted to change phones you had to call up Verizon and do a bunch of prompts to switch over from one phone to another
754  I will likely do the same  When I got my Apple Watch 6 with the AOD it was cool for a bit then got annoying and the hit to the battery life was more than I wanted to deal with so its been disabled on my Watch for quite some time  It also seemed rather useless on the watch because I almost always raise my arm to look at my watch so the normal mechanic of the display coming on when I do that works fine for me
What a waste upgrade No new tech stuffs Just bunch of useless apps
U beat the new Zelda trailer on trending thats how u know uv made it
tempting to get it because ATT is offering 1000 for my 12 pro atm nah Ill wait until next year 
No one is talking about the fingerprints on the front facing camera due to the dynamic island That would piss me off to no end
aw man the whole esim thing not fun esp if you travel and you want to use a diff sim not sure if there is a way to really work around it that not as terrible overall this 14 is the first apple phone to hafe my interest due to the dynamic island at leat they made the notch useful lol
Hm so older than an iPhone 11 and youd notice a difference suddenly I hate my XR lol
Im upgrading from 13 pro max to 14 pro max
Quick question about the sim tray Im form the Caribbean an we dont have an Apple Store  in my country but I could buy it online would it still come without a sim tray because we use mobile carriers heavily over here
The dynamic island is going to make that camera so smudgy
Time to put it up against the S22 ultra
I hope android doesnt copy the dynamic island as cool as it is but its more of an apple thing Androids already have more efficient uis already
Still no type c K bye
I think the Dynamic Island is the final solution to the notches All of them
Nice resume could you tell me which apps its that your have installed the icon its a little squares so its on widgets locks screen at the left so thanks you
I still think the AOD feature is best done by Samsung
Dude so thorough that I am a bit deflated for my new phone to come in the mail feel like I already have had it for a couple months after watching this 
Thanks bro
You mean theyve been copying the same iPhone since the iphone 12
Ok but fr can we just accept that majority of cases are not using physical film anymore so the limitations for 24fps just arent really there Yeah I know 12 time shutter speed per frame etc etc and like the correct motion blur but I would really like to see more content in higher frame rates
Does the action mode work for vertical video Ive only seen people using it in landscape
Dynamic island is Apples way to sell you the same phone from last year with a thousand dollar pricetag
MKBHD intro are just legendary
Lets call the Dynamic Island just The Island
Those zoomins make me look at the fingerprints over the front facing camera users would have to remember to clean it before using it
LG V10 RIP
What did he used to get the dots under the time in the Lock Screen
Still not enough new for me to go from my 12 Pro Max
I will be getting the iphone 15 for sure
The Dynamic Island is just a way of hiding the notch and making it cooler and the notch is only there for FaceID for the 3D photographs it requires Ill take having more screen over facial identification Ill take the simple holepunched front camera
You forgot to mention they messed up live wallpapers
Watching videos should be a little frustrating with this new notch thing
if they dont update the design or major features addition they should call these phones as version 131 or 132 etc rather than calling it a whole new phone cause its a slight upgrade  not a completely new over hall to call it a new phone version
do you ever just look in the mirror and be like wow Im a clown asking for a friend
Yes it will be copied For the next 10 years on the Iphones 
what is that lock screen widget on the left  with the dots
Whats the calendar widget youre using
Meh should be waterproof
Other than Dynamic Island I dont really see a need to upgrade from my 13 Pro Max The new camera set up looks really good but doesnt look game changing compared to the 13 Pro Max iOS 16 is running smooth as butter for me so I think Ill be holding off for another year
Yeah no that notch is ugly af and such a distraction Its a huge deal breaker especially with android phones that are near bezeless The future will be under the screen cameras
I dont think anyone will be coping it Its an apple thing that no one really need But the smoothness is 
Please give me that surfboard I need it
Sadly the US IPhone 14s will have no resale value on the used market the lack of SIM card slot I will be its Achilles heel
The best camera system of any phone this year I cant wait to see that get put to the test by many content creators
I want always on display on the 13 pro
eSIM thoughts
Xiaomi copied already
I really like the wallpaper he chose tho where is it from
LG Phones are probably the most underrated in the whole smartphone game We have been saying that from a very long time now
Oh So in my case after 18 years living in the US Im going back to Europe I was thinking to buy it before my trip I shouldnt do it  It will not work in Europe
I am in Ghana and want one of the hoodie but the delivery date is far in October If you can partner with a fast delivery service it would be great Something like express delivery wasnt available for me
Im glad he mentioned the LG V10 because thats exactly what came to mind the second I saw this I didnt use it then either I honestly hope its NOT copied to other devices
"They should put an update on iphone 13 pro max for its notch
It will be called DYNAMIC NOTCH
You first hear it here"
You and the crew killed the intro
Old VS New iPhone Same same but different
It kinda reminds me of LGs Second Screen
Shout outs to the lantern fly 
Buy an iPhone Save your life Kinda lame way to sell phones
"Scammers and Hackers are delighted to the new esim feature of the iPhone

Easy access to 2step verification

If Android will use esim as well I would switch to iPhone since their os is stricter"
The iPhone 14 Pro will be a hit otherwise iPhone 14 and plus version will be a huge disappointment
Yawn  another gimmick
Why isnt the front facing camera covered in the video
The Dynamic Island is cool but it definitely does not need the cutout for it to work I would have preferred them make the notch smaller rather than moving everything down which makes it feel even bigger
435 oh so I cant use it if I ever get buried alive
The Apple ad many were waiting for
no usbc is practically criminal on a phone of this caliber at this point
this will be copied if you are talking about the dynamic island my response is oh fck no if this plague does not end at Apple I will loose my sht There is a small hole punch in my current phone that I am able to tolerate If it starts growing I am throwing my phone against the wall
great editing
Im going from the 11 to 14 because my phone isnt on the 5G network and my service sucks
"Going from the XR to the 14 Pro
Think im gonna like this
Started with a 3GS
Then 4S
6
7
XR"
If they dont name the pill shaped cutout UI thing how are they going to refer to it when discussing it with developers or explaining to users how to use it  Sure Dynamic Island might sound funny but what other two words would better describe this feature Again it has to be referred to somehow because developers can update their apps to use it and users need to know how to interact with it Just keep saying pill shaped cutout UI thing
You keep saying the Apple way and I keep thinking its actually the correct way see face ID Samsung did that before Apple Apple perfected it and then they did it in Samsung People just said they copied them know we waited till the right parts were there and perfected it Apples always late to the game because they always perfect it
Dynamic
Can I put a pro max 14 in a pro 13 max case
I only upgraded because my iPhone 11 is on its last legs
Always on display gonna drain the battery like crazy my Apple Watch series 6 has a big difference if always on is off
watch tan goes crazy
The Dynamic Island feature will also Dynamically affect your financial status
Where is that wallpaper from
You left out the eSIM that everyone is talking about Whats your thoughts
"Did I hear you saying no SIM card
If true that means when I live in Europe half of the year I wont be able to change the SIM into my European Carrier Thanks"
Dynamic island  LG kkkkk Yeah sure
Everyone will wait until they add USBC on their 15s
"Others Our notch reduced by 50
Apple Our notch got a new name"
Wonder when the bugatti review is coming
300 having a panic disorder like
Just watched 22 min video of a guy talking straight outta his arse bro couldve summed it up in 30 seconds
Apple is selling you the same I phone with less features for the past 5 years dont be a sheep
That intro was something else 
this dudes reasoning is sooooo good
iPhone 7 Plus iPhone X are the most legendary updates ever on Apple in the 7 Plus we saw the dual camera setup for the first time on an iPhone and in the X we saw the much needed display upgrade all the other versions have been refinements not upgrades
Sick intro Deep purple will be the hardest color to be able to get for sure
nobody going to mention how dirty your front facing camera will get after constantly poking at it with your finger seems like a bit of a nightmare
Why no one is talking about how dope the intro was great job Marques 
Sheesh you know a video is epic when its 1 on trending
Hopefully they wont copy that modest 6gb of RAM unless it is for a lower midrange model
Could have given it a better name than dynamic island Thats the cheesiest term Ive heard even from Apple
Apple really knows how to sell stuff This dynamic island is just an excuse to make it seem like theyre innovating even though they didnt remove the notch Its a gimmick that I really hope Android manufacturers dont try to copy because its stupid considering how notifications and Android as a whole works I Android you simply slide your fingers from the top and have instant access to the same kind of content that the dynamic island delivers
"You like j cole that much 
Woow"
I am using iPhone 11 I dont see any difference between 11 and 14pro except the numbers
lol the iphones have better intros compared to the competition 
Shite
Thanks for the video but honestly I was kind of hoping we were moving away from the notch but at some point in the next few years we wouldnt have it but it looks like apples embracing it which is quite a bummer
He did the intro thing that someone recommended in a waveform clips comment
BEST INTRO known to man in 2022
E Sim kmt Apple
yea sure you apple service
1 trending my guy nice
Love the Kanye album bro Goat recognize goat
Mkbhd has good music taste
i dont prefer calling that it will be copiedbetter be to say it would be implemented
next year ANDROID PHONES WITH DYNIMAC ISLAND CALLED CAMERA ISLAND
"Disappointing review why didnt reviewers show dynamic island action in landscape
I wonder what the notification card looks like when playing games or watching videos"
"In the automotive industry you want people to know what your vehicle is at first glance and you do this by establishing a brand identity through the graphic features Like you know Lambo when you see one you know a BMW when you see one you know a Bugatti when you see one because of the clear brand identity they have established

In the smartphone industry nobody has done this better than Apple You know an iPhone when you see it The iPhone has a clear brand identity that theyve stuck with for the most part since the very beginning Even if one generation doesnt look a whole lot different than the last its still looks like an iPhone"
I used to work for a private race academy and we used brand new stock Corvettes and on star would shut a car down atleast once a week thinking the car was in an accident Super annoying honestly I hope apples crash detection is better than on star
well at least it requires flagship android phone to make look alike dynamic island
Whats different from the dynamic island than a widget 
iPhone 14 Pro  Max have Dynamic Island if we get stuck in this island it has Emergency SOS via satellite and Apple has brought both together 
"this is of course a new phone for a new year
this is of course apple cashing in on people with ocd and no selfcontrol"
I feel like youre being deluded at times trying so hard to give the iPhone some praise for innovation but in reality it does not offer anything new
The Dynamic Island is a master class on how to turn a bug into a feature
should I buy the iphone 14 pro or 13 pro then 13 pro is 1099 usd right now and 14 pro is 11374 usd in Poland
Users watch the screen and thus the UI most of the time Therefore changes in ways of interacting with the UI excites users more than the usual phone redesigns
Didnt like the intro Not what we used to

1 on Trending 
people who like the dynamic island are the same type ofpeople that believe in astrology
Why iam watching that when I cant afford it 
Actually I think hes wrong The only reason why Im getting the 14 pro is because of the dynamic island
If you have a desktopmac  laptop  iphone then this 14 us great But if you only have a phone then this us a big no Watching a video with this is like intentionally covering the screen with your thumb
"317

Wird enough as Im currently trying to learn Programming I was kind of visualising what you said as something they really shouldve been thinking and doing when developping the concept

A quite pleasant feelling Even if I know its based on nothing yet"
The thing that you said about eSIM card and traveling is untrue I just went through 30 countries in 3 months and the most reliable way to travel is using eSIM card right now I have iPhone 11 and did not use a physical sim card for a year now I dont even own one anymore
Its so identical I actually left it on a restaurant table 5 months ago and not one tech publication reached out to me
"That is cool but I thin that dynamic iland will flop like 3D Touch did
Imma stick with a 6S on iOS 12 as it has 3D Touch and a jack and durability that newer device dont have"
Saw a post online that xiaomi already copied this a few hours after it launched
Dynamic Island is going to be part of the design for the next 5 or 10 years its there to stay LOL
As a strange one Ive been wheeling my motorcycle and my Apple Watch continues to think Im going on a bicycle ride
There are two innovative features I cant be bothered to test them
They are clearly targeting iphone upgrades from 11 thats why the A13 comparison came into play  3 year cycle phone change makes more sense than comparing this to the year before
Always on display is pointless gimmick imo I always turn that off on my devices that support it
"Been waiting for this upgrade 
IPHONE XR GANG WHERE YA AT"
After watching the intro for the 100th time I think Im finally ready for the rest of the video 
Physical SIM card tray eSIM 
ok people so long story short the new iPhones have a bigger camara and instead of the notch theres a pill and thats it BOOM iPhone 14
intro clean asf
We need functional always on display apps For example a roku remote that displays controls that are immediately accessible without unlocking the phone Turns your phone into an actual TV remote The app stays running in the background but the screen is in AOD mode Or even AOD widgets like weather stocks sports scores airline flight data etc Stuff that you can glance at without needing to unlock the phone
Audio will now be my new starting word hahahahha
personally think the Australian version is slightly better giving us the ability to not only use an ESim for places like America but also a physical Sim slot for countrys that have not andor are yet to still make the move to ESims
I love you Marques but you said you were gonna get to battery but you never did Can you let us know your thoughts
Can iPhone 14 Pro beat Xiaomi 12 SU on the camera
Im still using the XR rn so def upgrading to the 14 pro its due for an upgrade
It gives me Touch Bar vibes
Could you do an episode on lidar please How it has taken over the world or is it a stillborn feature Has apple given up on it and all the associated augmented reality stuff from a few year back I take it the sensor is still on the 14 pro no one mentions it anymore
Reminds me of the early LG V series Second screen
Trading in my 12pro and getting the 14pro for 200 bucks over 3 yrs of 555 a month
Twice Ive slapped my hand hard on something to make a point and my Apple Watch has asked it Ive fallen Not the iPhone per se but same principle
Is it still worth it if its 2000 dollars
Why nothing about battery life 14 Pro Max beats 13 Pro Max by over 2 hours according to the tests so far
Another BS iPhone
I bought one because I need a new phone but I was appalled with the lack of innovation The Dynamic Island to me really isnt as big as people make it out to be
Nice but Ill stick with my Android phone 
98 win  on wordle is insane 
I get accidental triggers when Im playing with the banana
I feel dynamic island could have been implemented better in iPhone with notch just like Macbook pro notch design They could have notifications on the sides eliminating small space above pill shaped cutout
The way this always on display works it may lead to OLED image retention and I havent seen anyone else raise this concern
Hilarious how apple claim new technology with the dynamic island meanwhile my Old LG V10 had that feature almost 8 years ago
Accidently setting off the crash detection system is quite literally the first thing i thought of when it was announced it would have to have quite a few systems working in tandem to make sure it wasnt accidently set off in an actual car crash the phone would be thrown around ALOT getting hundreds of small movement points which would indicate a crash Im sure apple put test phones in crash dummy cars and crashed them to make sure the system was detecting an actual crash and not picking up on accidental triggers
Can we try to test the car crash with A remote controlled Toy car 
So the dynamic island doesnt do anything with the messages app I was hoping it would have a cool notification for textiMessages
I dont think it will be copied at all since android is pushing for more under display cameras
Shout out to the spotted lantern fly
Soa quick accessto an already quick access drop down menuI dont get the hype tbh
What calendar widget is in the thumbnail
The funny thing with the dynamic island is that it clearly started out as a way to camouflage the notch yet they ended up making a complete feature out of it that couldve been developed and implemented in the absence of a notch
1247 Those fingerprints piss me off 
I think I might just upgrade from my XR for this
Its not hoodie weather
I preordered the 14 Pro max upgrading from the 12 Pro because I want a larger screen and the better cameras
That 7 years ago on the LGV10 hits different Time flies
I think  apple is gonna add 8k video when they will switch the lightning port to type c port for easier and faster way to transfer large files  Maybe  its just my thoughts 
It was copied from jailbreak users
Can we appreciate this mans music taste Bro had Graduation and Born Sinner in rotation 
Am i the only one wondering if he records the iPhone shots with an iPhone
I dont know why it brought me so much joy when you said because its TECHTEMBER
Far behind from sony  120fps vs 30 fps hehehehe
"
Literally put this on after ordering 
My dBrand with Brown Leather and Glass
Had to use paypal"
I hope you killed that Lanternfly after you filmed it
Maybe its the 19 battery wasted on no cell service and not the AOD thats causing your battery expectations to be below par
1114  I see that number in the battery  thats a  super big feature
I need my first  Apple pro never had one this time Im getting one  the purple one
AOD is 2008 technology woooow nice one Apple  and its not AOD 100its a normal display but lower brightness
As if I could afford it but watching because MKBHD
and the bullshit with sattelites wont work not even 30 of the desired cases 1 sattelite cannot locate you
If the island was a good idea Android wouldve done it a shitton of years ago like Widgets and the AOD
The bug was a paid actor no bugs were harmed in the making of this video
that intro was sooooo good
Everytime I click a MKBHD video its either the best visual intro or a banger intro song Koodos to the whole MKBHD team
Loving iOS 16 so far but why does the Lock Screen music player and the dynamic island one not have a volume slider Annoying 
If you turn the volume down and watch this video you would have no idea if this was a 13  or 14 
why dont they push dynamic Island on iPhone X Xs 11 12 or 13 why  because its apple they want money and they treat you as an endusernot an Admin
dynamic island is like the Touch Bar for the MacBook its unnecessary but its there
Great video But why use an iFixit advertisment when Apple SPECIFICALLY got rid of right to repair
I think the entry price for an iPhone with an astrophotography capable sensor would be atleast 15002000 not just 1000
Why use that song for the intro marques its nostalgic brings back old marquess memories almost shed a tear there
I just loved that J Cole was playing the whole time
That LGv10 comment got me like oooooh
"Who is as well pausing the video and going to the LG V10 video to watch if its  actually true 




It is  LG so ahead of time

Thanks for the likes guys omg "
iPhoneiPhone 14 ProiPhone 13 Pro Max14 Pro Max
Camera seems to contrasty and processed
Sounds like someone needs to setup a YouTube demo derby to test this out
"MKBHD its and absurd Apple doesnt have high refresh rate 
Also MKBHD it has it now but you wont notice it"
any one has the wallpaper link idk but Marques you have the best wallpaper collection I have ever seen
"At first for me when I used to watch marquees videos I used to find him a bit boring He would explain things in straight paragraphs without much entertainment to it beyond telling me about what his reviewing And Id end up closing his videos half way through But over the year or so this has changed drastically With a few jokes and puns here and there Now I actually watch his videos to the end 

I dont like straight information when reviewing something If I just want details I can Google the devices specs and capabilities and just look at the pictures online Then Ill have all the information I need 
When am watching a video I want to be entertained 
So big up to MKBHD He has another fan now"
"ATTENTION 
PLEASE  STREAM AND LIKE  ROAD TO 110M

No simcard No Iphone 14 Thank you apple for making up my mind
Am I the only one that thinks the notch looks absolutely horrid
256
All the Android cameras will come from under the screens now Android user here
I feel like the Dynamic Island is what the old MacBook Touchbar tried so hard to be haha
Will you say the same when Apple releases a foldable phone
I like the island but I cant help notice iOS16 put the notes at the bottom but the island is at the top again Small hands almost won ALMOST
"Im pretty sure that the iPhone 14 pro has a great camera But crowning it as the best overall camera on a smartphone in 2022 seems a bit unfair 

MKBHD did the same with the 13 pro I will say the 13 pro arguably has the best video quality on a smartphone But when it comes to still photos The 13 pro lacked in quality and features when it comes to some of its competitors Such as the Galaxy S22 ultra and its pretty on par with the Pixel 6 pro  
MKBHD did a review on  Xiaomis 12s ultra and he said in the video that it was the best camera he used on a smartphone 

I respect his personal opinion But I disagree Its hard to call something The best overall when its only the best in one category"
Bumper cars man bumper cars
Cant beat the iPhone 6s its all you really need to this day
Does the pill stick down farther than the notch Im curious if it gets in the way of non zoomed in 169 video
Why on top these sensors and camera could be on the bottom of the screen This way is reachable
weird to me that you praised the 13 PM  but you seem less impressed with this one the 13 PM brought Pro motion to 10Htz  great battery life a light camera upgrade  sensor shift stabilization and this one brings Sat connectivity  Pro Motion down to a single Hzt and get the best looking always on you can find  The dynamic pill is a cool idea The Jump in GPU is quite big look at antutu bench and others no more dimming when u play intensive games for hours less heat the brighter display for outdoors you can find  i found out that the battery life is not better nor worse  its equivalent to the 13 PM which is king  to me this is the most changes we got in a Pro iPhone  you were way more enthusiast on your podcast on Apple campus what happened since then 
The S22 Ultras camera system still has the latest iPhone beat 100x zoom to be exact
Love the yellow section marking animations all over the video 
Since this iPhone was unveiled at an event called Far out with an invite card whihc featured stars in the sky I was expecting Apple to focus on astrophotography with this phone
An iPhone video sponsored by iPhone repair how ironic
i much rather have a notch and no that horrible island which destroy the video watching experience
If you ever had to use your new iPhone to use satellite for an emergency the cost related would be sooooo expensive Like 2550k for search and rescue better to have a prepaid iridium plan with GEOS setup so you dont get a 50k bill I do love the feature I wish they could build in satellite connectivity for everyday calls of off the grid or out of service range
"Wanted to try this out as my first iPhone but here in Europe they raised the price by 300 for no reason

The iPhone 14 Pro now STARTS at 1300 "
Its a floating notification bar
That intro was so clean I could eat off it
so its like a touch bar but for a phone 
Do you think the dynamic island will stay for the next 45 years just like with the notch from ip x to ip 13
You mean cinematic mode now supports 24fps not 30 which it always had
Yeah yeah yeah the phone is nice but can I play tower of fantasy at 60 fps or nahhhh 
"Always on display is just as useless as wireless charging in my opinion Id turn it off to And with OLED burn it will just be a factor with it But Im surprised that the dynamic island has changed better music functionality than the music widget Apple is odd with how it chose to make there software work

I also think dynamic mode will get people to get the iPhone 14"
1813 nice flex that hasselblad right there is the actual true 8k camera meaning that it costs a cool 8k to purchase
The only thing I notice is that he listened to jcole and I also am a fan
anyone know what that lock screen widget is on the left at 143
That intro gave me chills 
I was waiting for the 14 but after no visible changes Ill have to friggen wait for the 15 
Ios16 has a battery drain issue on all models
We must be heading towards an ice age
copy paste
i can see nothing phone 2 using this island 
SO LG haha
Every time I run my 12max without the case every one thinks its the 14
LG Always were the innovative ones
It also looks identical to the iPhone 12pro max
Upgrading to 14 Pro from my Iphone 7  Think its finally time
I wonder if the water color painting effect has been fixed on this phone  I hope so
Question is iPhone and jitterbug the same phone
I think Iphone will enable 8k recording when it will be able to record 8k from all the rear cameras
1145 battery percentage nice
Thank you for your ongoing top quality reviews Youve been my go to for tech updates for so long I almost take you for granted Almost Im sure your productions are way harder to make than they appear but I guess thats part of the attraction Not dissimilar from an S class Benz Keep up the fine work MKB
Well since the iOS 16 upgrade on my 13 Pro did away with my Wallet and Apple Pay and since Apple support was of zero help Ive ordered the 14 Pro 
I have had an iPhone from day one except when I went to the note 7 had if for 9 days before they recalled it for the faulty battery issues Just wondering what do you think I should go for next as I have been considering a change iPhone 14 pro max or The new S23 ultra as Im only invested in the apple world as far as my current iPhone 12 Pro Max and series 5 watch and have been thinking about a change
the dynamic island tricks they did are like the only thing that is genuinely cool Im sure others will copy but that happens all the time with every new feature anyone puts out end of the day its an Iphone and ppl will buy lol
People always wanted AOD on iPhonenow they wanna turn it off
The iPhone 15 is DEF gonna get a usbc port with 8k filming lmao I have a 12 Pro Max that has been my favorite phone I have ever owned and I am still deciding if this is worth the upgrade That dynamic island my push me to the edge though
Dynamic Island yet another thing LG pioneered
why would we want dynamic island on androids tho itd just downgrade the overall display
I finally feel like there is enough new stuff on the iPhone to make me upgrade my iPhone 11 and I love the fact that they added an always on display
Dead  Island 
I do like the alwayson display but definitely dont need it 100 of the time even when Im sitting next to the phone I wonder if flipping the phone will turn the display off without having to toggle the setting every time
The rule of iPhones upgrade every other year not every year My 13 Pro Max is one of the greatest phones Ive ever owned and is running iOS 16 just fine If its battery life lasts I might even wait 3 years to upgrade
Wouldnt putting your finger all over the front camera worsen its quality over time
This dynamic island name is coming from the people who called notifications toast because they pop up
So the 14s will now be using even the mic to detect loud sounds that might translate to accidents what about my privacy does it means they14s will now be always listening to me I dont think thats a very good idea Apple Only if Apple fanatics knew this 
My iPhone is now way more customizable than my Android phone but its not really a bragging point but it does feel good to have it and being able to change colours and style of lockscreen and even adding new colours and styles is unprecedented and this is just iOS 16 on my last year model  still I would have gotten the phone anyway with it or without it because the iPhone is just beautifully made inside and out since the last two additions of the pros
Apple does love for human hands to have to reach all the way up the screen First with the back button on upper left now with the island or whatever my hand is still on the bottom of the phone and gestures are done better in Android now
Almost makes me want to switch from my Samsunglol said almostno USB C Im out
Idk what anyone says all iPhones are the same 
Does anyone know which widget hes got on his Lock Screen with the calendar and all the dots
Front cameras gonna be diiirtyyy
Iphone 14 pro camera king in 2022 Before pixel 7 even comes out Yeah u are an apple fanboy Its not even the best right now But you wouldnt know since you didnt test phones like the oppo find x5 pro or the xiaomi ultra with the Leica after the updates
ESim stoopid
Why they name it dynamic island boi When they can name it dynamic cutouts
Whats the dots widget on the Lock Screen
selfie auto focus how close can you get can you take photos of your eyes
What wallpaper is that one
No sim tray is a deal breaker for me if you break your phone for whatever reason is so easy to take your sim card and put it in your backup phone so you dont have to stay out of reach while you fix or replace your main cellphone In every launch of amazing new products apple always figure how to fuk it up with some weird stupid decision
Been watching you since 2013
When are companies going to realize that copying apple is not going to get apple customers to move away from apple All you have to do is market your device better than them your product can be worse so long as the marketing is better
So I take it Marques is very eager to get the s23 galaxy 
Releases iPhone 14 review on the 14th I see what you did there
I always get a bad taste in my mouth when these reviews dont say anything about the 60 hz screen Talking about the pixel 6s 90hz screen was that its not 120hz so its not fast enough But 0 talk about how the iPhone still just has 60hz These reviews are feeling much less fair and real when apple tells you what youre allowed to talk about or not
"I could be wrong Im sensing a bit of a bias with your iPhone reviews from the last few years Ive been using an iPhone 13 Pro for the last 6 months and though I love the hardware I feel the camera is very poor compared to everything else in the market 
You said something similar in this review best camera in the market While subtling mentioning that it gets crushed in low light situations Also not mentioning that the telephoto lens is very poor compared to the others flagships in the market Stopping your zoom at 2x feels a bit manipulative"
Am i the only one to like multitasking on Android Swipe up Also am i the only one that turns off notifications from popping up during use I just get the notification icon so that if i want to check it i want  I dont want pop ups when in using my phone
I just hold it to see the spring colour 
Looks like my iPhone 12 Pro max will still be good for a few years lol
Cant wait for the S23 to retake its throne
Whats the leftmost widget on his lockscreen Looks cool
"3 million plus views in the same day of upload


goated"
I knew that other video was filmed with this phone
"Slightly above yeahh sure
Samsung did that 6 phones ago wtf"
Apple spends so much effort to try to blend the notch into the phone seamlessly In the end I think people would prefer no notch at all and build in that functionality behind the screen similar to an in screen fingerprint Lets go infinite loop work out that advanced tech
"IPhone14  car crash detected
Meanwhile Me Injured  Yeah I detected too

Its a cool feature though"
"Yep Dinamic Island just improvise from LG V10
Nothing new"
Nice Hoodie
I have the iPhone X and I was hoping to upgrade this year but honestly Im not sure if I should wait for the iPhone 15 This iPhone looks amazing but I might regret not getting the next one
Bro admitted to breaking an NDA 
I am not updating my iPhone 12 I love how light weight it is  this pro is getting too heavy for my wrists
Pretty cool
Use the dynamic island for the honeymoon period then youll be asking why did you base your whole decision to buy an iPhone on a Macbook touchbar
iOS 16 iOS 9 complete mode
Cant imagine the repair cost if ya broke the screen
what is that calendar widget on the Lock Screen
They are copying
Dont forget location sharing via Satellite For a lot of outdoorsy people this is a big deal Some of us even have a separate device and subscription just for this feature think Garmin Inreach Spot Tracker etc
"Prices on this phones are crazy in Europe Iphone 14 pro starts at 1319 
Thats not a competitive price thats a total rippoff"
floss
iPhone 14 Pro Max is awesome 
"I used to be an apple user not a phone ipod and ipad But considering the price and performance I went to Samsung And considering again went and stayed at Xiaomi
I havent been able to see anything new or exciting with Apple in a long time and I havent even considered switching for that reason"
Fire intro 
Expect a lot of smudges on the front camera
I was disappointed really I got the 13 mini today instead
Honestly a little bummed about the always on display coming from my oneplus 7t and its version this one seems a bit overdone
I was wondering why video takes so long to end and why Marques sounds different and I realized playback speed is on normal You do not watch Marquess videos on normal speed
I have a Redmi 10 Im so disappointed My huawei 10 stood strong better than my Redmi 10 why
Actually esim makes international travel so much easier with services like Airalo that sell temp esim cards
307 Maybe you have a D brand case on it and drop it on the floor or something how very subtle of you 
The way Marquess and Peter McKinnon just referenced each other in their videos is great
Apple took at a glance from Pixels and ran with it to make dynamic island and actually executed it really well
The most geeked out I got for this whole video was during the brief photo of the Hasselblad X2D  Please please please tell me we are getting an MKBHD review of that camera  I love watching videos about things I cant even afford to rent
Ill stick wit samsung
I just dont know why anyone would want to purchase a new phone with last years internals and think its cool
30 FPS
Im still rocking my iPhone Xr and Ill probably still be using this phone in like 5 years hahah
ITS CRAZY HOW EVEN MARQUE BROWNLEE IS SO EXITED ABOUT THIS IPHONE 14 PRO IS BASICALLY THE SAME PHONE AS 13 PRO MINOR IMPROVEMENTS FOR YEARS MQBHD WAS SO  NEAUTRAL ON PHONES BUT NOW I CAN SEE THAT HE MIGH BE GETTING PAID BY APPLE DONT GET ME WRONG APPLE MAKES GREAT PHONES BUT TO SAY THAT THE DYNAMIC ISLAND IS SO GREAT IS SO MISLEADING I THINK WHEN IN REALITY THIS IS JUST COVERING THE NOTCH THATS A BIT SMALLER NOW BUT STILL THERE  SO DISAPPOINTED ON APPLE 
"8k videos are coming next year when Apple is finally forced to comply with EUs new universal charging cable rules
Holy shit its a twofer everybody
8k videos AND USBC Sign me up nomnomnom  said all iPhone users to be fare Im one

Hashtag courage Hashtag magical
Apples gonna Apple"
Im upgrading from an iPhone XS and Im looking forward to it Thanks for such a detailed and thoughtful review
Looks like the S22 Ultra is still better 7 months later LMAOOOO
Steve Jobs is so disappointed at the apple world
I would like to know what one should do if a virus should attack ones Android or Apple
IMHO and personal experience esim is a lot more convenient for international travelers Its easier than ever to subscribe to a data plan abroad thanks to the different esim online comparators
Apple doing apple things Same thing but one change each year
Jesus i might want that hoodie
The opening was exactly as the other user who mentioned it would be Great work team MKBHD
as a fan of youu  why I feel like you sounds being paid from samsung to mock apple hahaha idk the vibes compare when you review others just seems off to me
Teslasurfboard
My dude Hoodie season Im just wondering what the case situation is Everyone says the cut outs are different  why cant they just save my soil year to year
My S20 pro is still better than this wtf
i hate the io16 notfications why is it on the bottom of the screen
I just want to know if theyve updated the antenna strengthquality Verizon Samsung user for years and have never had service issues until switching to the 12 series Its been awful Thats what I would really consider upgrading for
I am currently using an s21 ultra Is it worth switching to 14 pro Need some advice
honestly this is the worst review youve done in MONTHS It felt lazy You didnt talk ab build quality Because its all the same Dude not everyone watches your reviews Youve had the phone for days now and didnt bother to show the Always on Display when youre driving and have gps on didnt bother to give us b roll outside like youre known to do didnt bother to talk specifically about the 14 pro max and the battery life hits  Didnt talk about call quality didnt even bother to unbox the phone Youre getting lazy on us and it shows
Disappointing to hear the AOD impacts battery life so much Hopefully they can sort that with more aggressive brightness control
You missed one possible pro eSIMS may protect you against SIM swap attacks
Removing sim slot was a step back i started my preorder during the announcement and when they got to the part oh hey we are going to remove sim slots because we are apple i stopped Maybe wait for something to become obsolete before u completely shift away from it Now i have to buy a separate phone if im traveling Ooooohhhh thats very Appley now it makes sense
Upgrading from the 13pm had to add an extra 600
"I just got the iPhone 13 pro and the main reason for me to buy it its because I live in Germany and for some reason the 14 will arrive more expensive then last year so I trade my 12 mini for the 13 pro so basically I got the 13 pro for the price of the 14
Regular"
Right because astrophotography is high on everyones list 
I love Dynamic Island But the LG V10 was and still is my favorite phone I loved the steel sides and top screen
the appla AOD is so stupid Just keep the clock and notifications and make everything else closed pixels Also that space above the pill is just useless its basically a deeper notch
did Andrew ever determine if they want the clamp hidden the back or not Inquiring minds need to know
Still rather have the S22 Samsung ftw
Dannnggg this vid blew uppp
2 on trending
Worse battery than last years phone wich is still miles away from the competition Apple sure knows how to get your money while giving a worse product
Can you turn the Dynamic hole off
cool if messages alerts from the dymanic island
Pixel gang wya
idk about you but I still perfer my phone screen to not have a noticeable hole on it when Im watching videos or playing games
Tim say  More fluid more intuitive
The iPhone 14 Pro is also the same size as my iPhone 12 Pro I got my new iPhone 14 Pro case already and it fits my old 12 Pro
Did you purposely spend the same amount of time talking about the cameras as apple 
I think it should be copied copied onto the base line iPhone 14 Great job
Test the car crash detection feature in a bumper car
When you are Marques Brownlee an NDA doesnt mean anything lol you are TIM COOK
"Massive props to mkbhd  the editors

Their slight zoom ins to footage are just so nice Apple like and Im an android person

What a dream to watch"
Im curious if crash detection will be triggered by rollercoasters Im going to DisneyWorld next week gonna test that
So well be getting smudged selfies left and right on social media because of the dinamic island poking Cant wait to see that trend
Honestly dont think anyone will be copying a marketing solution to hide Apples inability to make the camera and sensors seamless Others will be pursuing a way to hide the camera completely behind the screen as sensors are already
i know full well that the dynamic island adds no useful functionality but its just so pretty prettier than any holepunch ive seen and it has reliable face id
S essentially nothing new
At 1857 he sounded like a villager from minecraft 
Samsung Continuum had the same feature in a separate OLED display on bottom
wouldnt the always on display bleed the screen or something
have someone ever thought that everytime you touch the dynamic islands leaves your precious fingerprints in the camera and if its time to take you selfies it will be blurry as your grandmas eyesight
Nice review Im ordering one
What is the number on the battery
I still like the Xiaomi 12S Ultra better  lets see what the iPhone 15 Pro Max will look like without the notch Island bar whatever
How do I do that
Hold up you got the new phone before anyone else 
That globe in the background with the word Dynamic pinned over an island 
AOD is exclusive to the iPhone 14 pro What a slap in the face Lets make a whole new display that goes to 1hz so older iPhones with OLED cant get it
the dynamic island has a green dot during video so there are pixels there
Seen comparisons with iPhone 13 pro and camera makes little to no difference seriously one of the weakest if not the weakest update ever from Apple Very very lazy product from trillion dollar company
Did he just admit to violating an embargoNDA
Please how can I use my iphone camera on my Mac as an external camera
I like the name Dynamic Island  Its creative
Just wondering if the pill is going to shrink in the future like they did on the iphone 13
I wanted to join your club bro but how you gonna charge 7 bucks a month come on bro Thats half an hbo account
That iPhone 3g fish wallpaper though 
The 3 guess Wordle flex
At this rate android wont need to copy it because we are kinda past notch hole cameras with the new under display cameras that apple will get in 8 years
That intro had me run it back a few times Amazing work
What is that always on display oh god probably one of the worst features ever implemented by apple Who would want this thing turned on Its literally just your lock screen but with lower brightness which also means that it drains an huge amount of battery life compared to classic always on display
Basically folks its THE same phone as 4 years ago STILL Dont let thede reviewers fool you its the same garbage Apple does not give a F about truly upgrading the phone because you idiots keep buying the same thing over and over thinking you are getting NEW tech
Holy crap that 48mp image looks WAYYY better than the binned 12
It will be annoying to see the huge  punch hole while playing games and watching YouTube
Lou calling it Crazy Pill instead of Dynamic Island is so much better
Stop trying g to male this Apple product worth the money Youre shilling way to hard now and its noticeable
"Bro I was
Waiting for this video all month and you nailed it Youre the got bro I hope to one day grow up to be like you"
Selfie cam will always be smudged and blurry thanks to the dynamic island
Can you truly only see one notification icon on the left New compromises every time I look into switching from Android
It doesnt matter what good can be an iPhone at the release date Apple is famous by deprecating your products even if you invest much money in care of them this is the reason I started to hate Apple Id been all my life a person who take care very well on my own things and now that doesnt matter because year by year Apple deactivate something in background or reduce your photo quality or reduce the radios performance or several things more to force you to buy a new one this is the real reason of contamination is as crude as I say savage capitalism a sickness for the money arrogance maybe yup
Apple Watch joke was funny Congrats on 2 on trending behind only a major Nintendo direct video Great vid
As an iPhone 11 user who is constantly using their iPhone in the car landscape mode having the ability to use Face ID in landscape is reason enough for me to upgrade plus the dynamic island is sick Lol
I like the name Dynamic Island lol
from what Ive watched on youtube the starlink ones any present phone unless you kept a dinosaur phone will connect to satellite services so from my understanding the iphone satellite blah blah blah would be just indirect false marketing ah if I understood incorrectly please let me know  I would appreciate so  Wishing you all the most excellent dayeveningnight
I think you are late island feature is already copied by some random guy Android
recycle of cases and accessories should have been a priority 5 years ago but still good step to reducing waste and factory emissions Theres a recession coming and most will be behind on the model scaleThanks for the heads up apple
Marquess how can I get rid of my emails completely on the IPhone 7 Plus  They keep coming back Im frustrated  Ive tried YouTube but its not working they just keep coming back and even when I delete the messages the email icon will still show 200 emails even though I just deleted them 
Still on the edge whether to upgrade to a 14 or 13 Pro from the XR but this review might just have edged me towards the 14
I definitely think its a step in the right direction since they were able to apply it very well
Do you get sim trays in Canadian models both for 14 and 14 pros 
iOS 16 on my iPhone 12 Pro feels like an update already
"Slightly saddened that bigger channels dont understand or praise the mini Phones 

Faster chips dont matter at all anymore its not even worth mentioning

Allot of customers have no clue about what their buying and think buying a pro is the best choice

When in reality they barely if at all use the extra camera use the better ipx rating or even battery life
Heck my captain doesnt even see the difference in hz on his screen compared to 60hz

Most dont think about repair costs either
Let alone the insanely good formfactor of the mini

The 13 mini fits in sports rear pockets finally it fits for 1 hand use while cycling running anything really And it makes one more confident holding it for photos Lighter is definitely better 

And the the phones have no practical compromises anymore anyway

Phone cameras are not handicapped in night anymore they stabilize the image and have an wide lens 

The magnetic back is such an practical improvement for the battery packs too 

Ill keep rebuying the mini as long as possible thats for sure

My moms 6s plus is working completely fine too Hope the 13 mini will work for a decade at least "
Can you say roughly how long you had the phone to reach these conclusions
I cant wait til Samsung comes up with their own version of a Dynamic Island 
Whats the first widget on the left that marques is using on his phone in the video
You know when the video starts with this song its fire
The way the  iPhone 14 came from the front camera lens was amazing and satisfying asfffff
Boring phone because nothing special new
Hmmmm
Apple juts went above and beyond any completion AGAIN And the Dynamic island name I think its ok not the best but I wouldnt call it dumb Apple always finds a way to arrive to the party in style and make it their own That sync between the two actual hardwares black outs on the screen with black pixels is so sick Id call it the bridge on the dynamic island
WHO CARES WHY
So Ill be getting the iPhone14 pro by getting the iPhone13 pro Awesome 
Ive been a iPhone user since I can remember this year I made a change to the fold 4 and I defiantly dont regret it
"I want iPhone to copy Motorola and use the shake to wake flashlight 


Also I want Siri to do more Turn on Bluetooth and WiFi from commands Siri to have access to your messenger app 


Also maybe a detection for your music to flawlessly play from vehicle to AirPods as you walk out    Also phone calls etc"
13Pro SS
Marques how is the battery life in the 14 pro vs the 14 pro max For someone who would be happy with either form factor should that play a major part in buying decisions
Is it worth the upgrade from a 12 Pro Max
Where I get the wallpaper
Does dropping test it triggers crash detection
HuaweiHonor pulled the dynamic island thing in 2018 with the honor v20 What is new here
No having the SIM tray sucks I love being able to quickly get a SIM card while traveling
I personally dont see how this can be copied Apples hardware and software are one and the same In android world there are too many variants to integrate this kind of low level hardware agnostic dynamic island Unless Google offers an API of sorts Apple knows this
I have a very thoroughly used iPhone 12 and will be upgrading to the 14 pro They got me with the Dynamic Island Stupid name and definitely a marketing scheme but its better than just a notch
Marques Brownlee Im trynna upgrade from a 7 and Im sticking with iPhone I was thinking 13 bc of the price drop it seems like the better value compared to the 14
Crash detection is great and all but thats if the iPhone survives it or else ur pretty much dead
anyone know what app his lockscreen calendar widget is from looks hella clean
Every one copies for everyone  Im upgrading my iPhone 12 Pro Max but not to the 14 pro max Im getting the s22 ultra in burgundy
"Wow is that ugly or what if Steve Jobs was around this ugly thing would have gone to the bin

This seems to be the worst iPhone in a long while They have not moved ahead in like 4 years now subtract the cameraand they just made the screen hideous why"
Great review JiDion 
Ill buy the 2024 iPhone when it uses USB C
 sticking with my 13 mini
And dont be negative or we wont send you one next year
man im excited for mine to come in
Next level
142 can someone tell me the name of the app that gives that calender widget its not the default Apple one or Google Calender
Haptic feedback on the keyboard is just now being added Whats the Apple reason that took 14 iPhone model years to introduce that
"I dont know what it is or if its even different but I really like the color grading of this video
Edit spelling is hard"
Love the remix of Bon Iver as the opener Great video again
In India base ip14 is 1000usd
I dont really care about the island is beautiful but that speaker is Gorgeous how you fell about the sound
Apple is trying to compete with under the display cameras cause they cannot figure out how to  hide their horrendous notch and now they brought this dynamic island Feature i like how MKBHD pointed in this video yes LG already came up with this idea  and yes they did LOL  Okay Apple see you in 5 more years where other companies will figure out how to make their displays and hardware better and then it will take Apple another 5 years to integrate it into one of their worthless iphones lol
as time goes on iphones look more and more like androids
Can it use 2 apps at once yet lol
I refuse to buy a new iphone until USBC
The notch looks like a stinky A21 or A11 bullshit wonder how many more years they can keep getting away with it
If you buy a new phone for attention you got problems
If you show footage of you taking a picture please show the picture afterwards
They got you hook line and sinker on the island  Apple cant figure out how to remove the bezel so this is their solution
Oh my goshwho has the x2d
Ugh I MISS Dark Sky on my Android Worse thing Apple has done to us RCS considered
The apple way aka 510 yrs behind Android
I want to get to a place in life where I can casually drop a 2000 phone on the ground
insider tip the chip is the same as last years its only firmware they unlock to get it to go faster
No photographer though we were getting an Astro mode 8k video on a phone is ridiculous Still love your work
So the amount of useless space caused by having a notch just got bigger by having wasted screen space above the notch 
There is no reason for a notched iphone not to have the same functionality as the dynamic pill Apple only does this to create a little new gimmick for the 14 pro
ngl your intros hit harder than Apples marketing materials
Should I upgrade from iPhone 12
How will it detect being crashed into ie youre in a car thats stationary maybe at a red light and a car slams into you
Im waiting to see what kinda of changes they made to thermal cooling hopefully there is vapor cooling on pro  models
ESim only is a big L its unfortunate he just shrugged it off
Great down to earth no BS review As a current XS user who is ready to upgrade this battery challenged model I am so looking forward to Fridays delivery of the new 14 ProMax model
definitely not upgrading this year probably going to change to samsungs next release
Black color is really nuff That purple pops
Dynamic island may be cool but is it better than no notch at all or a hole punch in a corner
I have E SIM in my XR its old school
Was it just me or I actually heard seagulls when the intro highlighted the dynamic island
How can MKBHD say the iphone 14 has the best cameras when he also just said that he doesnt do detailed reviews of phone cameras  How much is Tim Cook paying to sponsor this channel 
Hocus pocus fan  But cool video and the DI seems nice
that wallpaper I want it
they probably did the esim thing for usa only because americans dont travel out of the country much
The iPhone 14 is a skip for me
I wish someone would speak about the Audio performances of the new iPhone lineup
I have the 13 pro I wanted to know if the 14 pro has 120hz
"Mental model Android should be thought of as a phone OS that is capable of arranging any number of pixels to do any number of things while in any app or no app at all while triggering anything based on anything or nothing with andor without user input or customization

iOS model This is an app box You click to open an app Sometimes some things will possibly have interaction when you arent occupying the whole screen with the app but the meta app the OS isnt free and open to doing anything and everything You can probably do the same things but it may take 17 steps"
Man look at this animations sick video
1102 I like how it looks like theres no notch at all when its like that man
That intro was clean af
For me I dont see it as a big enough upgrade to go from my 13 to the 14 Pro But Im stoked about the Dynamic Island and hope it comes on base model 15s next year Thatll be an easier upgrade for sure
What is that calendar widget
No thanks Im gonna hold on to my iPhone XS Max
I love your reviews
Be sure you dont forget to floss 
Ofc theyre not gonna compare to the A15 chip cause theyre trying to sell that in the other new phones
Why no usbc When
Dynamic island means the pill is here to stay 
I work from home at a desk all day and have my iPhone on a MagSafe charging stand like 16 hours a day so battery life is not a problem for me I would have upgraded from my iPhone 13 Mini just for the Always On Display if they had put it in iPhone 14 Not gonna get a Pro just to get the AOD 
Test crash detection with a cheap old drone that you hit a cement wall with
Someone could call SOS in a remote country to ask them to bring a phone with a SIM card tray when in Need
new color space black space gray no
this wont cuz its shit
"300 run up a flight of stairs

Oh is that what were calling it these days"
Satelite think this is the firstish phone doing this in some years we will have less usage of mobile antennas And apple are in front quite cleaver
I have the iPhone 13 pro max and I want to switch to Samsungif I get the s22 ultra or fold 4 and tab s8  and galaxy watchdoes it all connect to each other like Apple ecosystem Like if I search something on my s22 ultra it will show up in my history on my tab s8 Headphones connect to all devices just as good as Apple
Really feels like we are starting to see the software and hardware maturing now
The whole Dynamic Island isnt new There is  third party app that came out in 2019 that been doing this from the Beginning on Android
I feel like the 13 pro max has the best movie viewing screen now So Im waiting it until that pill disappears
I think your low battery life could be because of no cell coverage
the fact that you have to soil the area of the front facing camera on purpose isnt silly
Wouldnt this fuck up the selfie cam by constant touching the front camera
Im really surprised how much new thins Apple has brought
Why does Apple take so long to change its designs Yes they have improvements but one feels like buying the same smartphone year after year Ill wait until the 15th if the design changes
I started watching this dude when I was 12 years old now Im 21 props to you my guy keep up the awesome videos
Wait the back glass is separate now Thank you Apple gods Seriously why wasnt it like this from the start
"I like the island but my Samsung has such a teeny tiny round dot only which I like more
But Id take a pill if I got face id
I freaking love it on my iPad but my phone face unlock basically is a bond grandma calling her grandson by her dead hundands name Then guessing"
Upgrading from 11 Pro is a nobrainer for me even after installing iOS 16 I get all the improvements of the 13 Pro and the 12 Pro also included in 1 phone Even the body is a nice and new for me while I geddit for anyone looking from a 12 Pro onwards
F Apple big time
You just dont like Apple youre more of an android fan for me it goes down to personal preference you just Gotta respect what Apple have done
Dang you should be working at Apple 
Something to add about this phone that I think is pretty cool is the use of lasers that can map geological areas in the world real time like LiDAR With accurate measurements too
Want one 
I would switch from Android to Apple if they made it USBC Come on Apple why are you still using lightning port that is based on USB20 
As cool as this whole Dynamic Island might be the goal should be to eliminate any kind of notch or punch out and not embrace it
Next year Tmobile is gonna team with Starlink and will have sat connectivity
Can the Dynamic Island  be turned off It still seems invasive and unneeded
Think Ill stick with Google upgrade to the Pixel 7 Pro this time around iPhone 14 Pro looks good but idk if there is a reason to switch back to Apple
"Android users be like dude I had those featurings in 2015
iPhone users THATS SIIIIICK "
Id rather have the tiny small dot that is on Samsungs phone
What about the smudges on the front cameras that you constantly need to clean because of using the dynamic island feature  
"Why copy a huge hole All other brands are working on non intrusive cameras on the display or full display experience Apple have a huge hole that is not so good on fullscreen videos or games And they make the dynamic island to make it even bigger like a status bar always present On Android phones they just want full screen experiencie underscreen sensors not a huge dark hole on the screen

So Apple is copying the others by using finnaly a punch hole but too big Hope that any Android make doesnt want to ruin full screen experience make a small hole on a huge hole with animations"
Throw it out of the window while youre driving
i have an 11 pro max and am really debating upgrading this is a pretty nice upgrade but i was hoping for something a little more but at this point im not expecting a huge jump in the Iphone 15 either
To be honest This phone is shit It is just Copy paste from the iPhone 13
Why the hell would apple put the area you press on the dynamic island over the front camera I can see your finger print smudge on it in the video 1247  Let me guessjust clean you phone before taking a selfie iPhone diehards are like McDonalds die hards they will defend apple till the end even if they sale overpriced garbage
Honestly rather di have it like a task bar at the bottom of the screen Better for ease of use and less finger prints on the selfie cam
That intro gave me Flashbacks to iPhone X review Perfect 
1600 kill the lanterfly
I really wish android wouldve just blended the notch into the notification drop down Literally the same thing as dynamic island Also you wouldnt have to smudge up your front facing camera all the time if it was better integrated with a notification shade
Watching on my Z Fold 4 I ordered the Pro Max in purple as my main phone because  Apple is my OS of choice I carry both IPhone and Android because together they make the perfect device
Because Apple made it it will be copied If Motorola made a phone like this nobody would buy it Besides this whole dynamic island thing is just Apple doubling down on the notch cutout thing
dynamic island nothing more then apple marketing stupidity just so they can hide the under camera cause they could not archive a full hidden screen yet
Im not gonna spend the money Im not gonna spend the money Im not gonna spend the money
Feels so ironic apples iPhoneiOS becoming Android in terms of internals and customizability Apple is literally copying android features improving each but still the design is the same Android is still ahead miles away in terms of features like multitasking and most especially in price
Hows the print screen with that dynamic island active Is it really visible
Can you turn off the always on display
Honestly I think your intro is better than Apples showcase
Apple please bring me a touch id on a lock button so the rest of the industry can copy this rather than a a island that now is more annoying than a notch
The dynamic island reminds me of an android style widget centred around the notch I feel like any Phone can do that without a hole punch Is it harsh to say I dont see innovation when from my perspective all I see a massive notch with notifications around it and a fingerprint smothered front facing camera
How did u get alpha in the 3rd try 
"Dynamic island is the same as Hey buy my most expensive phone
MARKETING"
Just like you copied every other youtuber ever
I still have the original iPhone X and Im upgrading to the 14 pro so its going to be quite the leap for me
U have an obvious apple biashard to take anything seriously when u cant be objective
Not to be inappropriate but if your making love itll ask if youre working out lol
Boring phone
Emergency SOS satellite will be copied also 
Im disappointed they didnt change to USB C So much of what I use can all use the same cords I wanted to come back to iphone but once again they kept the lighting cable Once they switch Ill come back They already did with the iPad so I dont get why theyre waiting
A lot of what was announced is so edge case and mostly useless
Your review cant be copied 
I dont think dynamic island will be that difficult to replicate
Awesome cant wait for my chevron hoodie to arrive looks really dope
So because i live in australia i would have a sim tray
1600 You took a picture of a spotted lanternfly Very invasive species kill on sight
How can anyone believe MKBHD isnt extremely biased towards Apple when he consistently gets prerelease hardware from Apple and better reviewers like LTT have to buy everything themselves
Marques that hoodie looks so fire
how did we get an iphone 14 review before the fold 4
Hey bro why did you not mention the ram Is it a new lpddr5 now on iphone 14 pro max or still the same lpddr4x
"Wonder how long will take for the displays to burn out with the AOD I used it for ages in my Mi9 and even though it changes place often to avoid the burn out of pixels within 3 years it ended up catching up marks on the display Same went on with chrome being open for long periods and ended up leaving marks of the open tabs and so on Id imagine that AOD its improved but still will leave marks on the display at some point In this case the whole display lol 
Since Ive got my mi11T pro Ive changed the settings to turn it off after 1 minute to avoid burning out the display"
I have an XR and am ready for a change While many of these features are nice none are game changers or huge incentivizers As sad as it is all Apple had to add to compel me was USBC In an ideal world we wouldve also gotten a hires audio codec If they could deliver lossless over wireless that would be a game changer especially if paired with their new spatial audio recognition system assuming it works Ill hold out hopes for AirPods Max 2 and iPhone 15
Dynamic Island  
" roller coasters  
Will the phone be confused and enable a crash detection "
That dynamic islands feature list with a black times new roman on white background is the least MKBHD thing I have ever seen  expected to see in any video lol so unpolished lol
"1106 1114 

Whoops"
I got 2 views in 2 hours but this vid got 3mln views in 3 hours as marques shared it on IG well I still can beat it coz I have one more hour hahahh
"Apparently LG did it all
Then ran out of gas"
"I love how apple turned the most hated thing about their smartphones massive notch into the most hyped and wanted thing in a smartphone
Very clever apple"
1806 Over Expose the DARK skin  I WOULD KNOW 
I used to listen to that intro track years ago ahahah Unlocked a memory
Ive had 48MP for the last 2 years I LOVE the nonbinned full 48MP So much detail which is the most important aspect of any photo to me
I still refuse to accept Apples Dynamic Island name I still believe it should be Dynamic Bubble
Apple had to name the dynamic island because if they didnt someone else would and they wouldnt like it
The intro Needs to see this on studio
Not worth it spending thousands used it for investment stocks instead
What I got from this is iPhone has borrowed ideas from Androids over the years and this still continues lol Steve Jobs daughter even bashed it on a deleted tweet Lol
They really gotta do away with the black space
The dynamic island looks tope but the upsides to esimonly are none and for me they would properly a deal breaker
"Is it just me or those the island sit lower within the screen than the notch It appears to be more intrusive when watching fullscreen content Its smaller compared to the notch but the notch was pushed against the side when in landscape being not as obtrusive 

Am I imagining this"
My new work is covering my phone and im actually going for the 13 mini haha
I can see horror movies using that Satellite feature at some point when the protagonist is running from the killer Or just acting like that feature was never invented so we dont all just scream USE SATELLITE MODE in the theaters
Smaller  on the max
So hard to give Apple they flowers sometimes Its simple they went OFF
I REALLY hope Android phones dont copy the island The usability of it is nice but I cannot stand looking at that Even the hole punch in the corner of my OP10 Pro annoys me to look at I cant stand notches or hole punch cameras Im afraid its only going to get worse now
I personally think that the dynamic island is a great touch from Apple except the name Also I am gonna cop that chevron hoodie
Anyone catch the reminder marques put to floss 
I forgot about the V10 that phone was legendary
yes they exceeded our anticipation of the pillshaped hole During the leaks we were very anticipated coz of its pill shape that forms an i for iPhone And we thought that it is a better alternative for the old notch on previous iPhones But Apple who does thing with great mastery did the best hardware cut on the screen and integrated it with the software making it a new UI that every Android shall imitate They are truly sticking with their principle to  provide better software you must be in control of the hardware viceversa
"Review felt a little biased
Dont get me wrong video must be still superior compared to Android 
But for stills  and selfies etcWill wait for mrwhose the boss for a camera comparison"
Are you using a new mic for your videos or have I just never noticed the extreme amount of sibilance in the audio Deessing should help
I hate iPhones but I have to admit theyve left Samsung and other Android devices in their dust especially when it comes to cameras
Iphones are waste of money they all the same 12 and up
Supersaf had a pic of you and 3 more people  the apple event  YOU looked so short how tall are you
Where did you get the wallpaper
that lint on your sweatshirt is killing me still the best tech videos on youtube though
MKB team dropping a better intro than Apple themselves 
I cant stand the dynamic island I prefer the notch instead
Oh wow the iphone 15
I think you can test it by using a remote control car
Aw yes the best thing was dynamic island which means touching ur front camera a lot and a quick selfies gonna be ow sorry let me clean this greasy screen first lmao
Apple cannot building an iPhone without the notch so they will do their best to camouflage it because they cant invent an alternative option  I personal think its a flaw in their design at this stage of tech
I bet a lot of phones could be destroyed in the crash itself
Test crash detection on a roller coaster Your in New Jersey go to Six Flags Great Adventure and ride Kingda Ka Worlds tallest coaster456ft and North Americas fastest coaster128mph
not the samsung flipphone ad 
Ive iPhone 12  Do you recommend upgrading to iPhone 14 pro 
So I can just buy the iPhone 13pro case
300  someone randomly at 3am getting that have you started working out
No sim Thats bs
WHOS GOT THAT WALLPAPER LINK
How does the display look with the notch while watching movie or video 
I dont think it will be copied  its there because apple dont know how to integrate their front cameras with the screen  and had an ugly notch forever and now a weird bubble looking thing
The glass on the back is seperate Biggest change right there
The pros for having an eSIM are so weak
Apple just copies everything else 
The old intro kinda feels nostalgic
Its just getting an always on display 
1813 not my mans Apple Watch tan line 
 i dont really care about that That hurts apple
One thing I DO like about eSim is the likelihood of SIM takeovers decrease I have seen an increase where I work of people having ID theft and having a full SIM takeover that becomes extremely difficult
NAUR NOT THE AD OF THIS VID BEING SAMSUNG
Of course you wont test it Why would you make Apple look bad
what happened to your knee why do you need pt
I ditched apple for samsung best move ever apple are so boring now
bumper cars maybe
Yeah whenever I have a wank my apple watch thinks Im cross training 
So what youre saying is the iphone selfie camera is racist
You said connecting AirPods twice
Why is it called Chevron hoodie
They should add a dynamic plus pro Continent on the next phone
Marquis stop bro You know you think its a 135
My dude whats this fresh new energy Love it
Its gonna have the best performance as well
iPhone has been copying some Pixel features over the last few years  The recent one being Photonic engine which is already a copy of Pixel feature thats been in existence for sometime now
Which is the video about the features 
"I was hammering something and my Apple Watch thought I had a bad fall lol

Happened only once though"
Lets see how fast Google Pixels copy this
Are people genuinely fooled by the dynamic island Like its still a big black bit in the screen with some clever coding
Does YouTube itself work on the island what about twitch etc
Is the battery percentage a new feature
I have the 13 Pro Max Regret getting the Max model Almost willing to pay for iPhone 14 Pro because I dislike the Max model that much
I seriously wonder what the Reachability feature looks like on the 14 Pro as putting UI way out of reach like that is not very user friendly I cant find any examples anywhere of people using Reachability though
Marquess is brown we love chocolate  even dress and look like the bar 
"Please I am in need of a device
Anyone with a good used phone and is willing to give it away would be much appreciated
Thank you"
the metal stand holder thing on the right side of the intro was kinda weird
New comparisons are coming that I will look forward to
No sim for traveling sucks
Ive had an iPhone 8 for the longest time Its still amazing and personally it seems like a waste of money for an iPhone x just more redefined If iOS 17 supports the 8 plus  Ill probably keep it if not Ill upgrade when the iPhone 15 pro drops
Is the icon on the back still a button
That feature is wack
Im glad you gave the credit to lg 
Nobody is talking about the intro
2129 for the 1TB model
all i see is the front camera getting convered in finger prints
"The esim only thing sucks Not a fan even for someone who doesnt travel internationally

Seems like a solid offering otherwise though if you need an upgrade"
Bro apple is years behind others i dont know why people keep throwing their money at them im all about Apple dont get me wrong but they are behind and its embarrassing
Ok so nothings new
This video was basically Marquues ranting about iphone 14 the most adult way possible 
They will place the phone in a crash test car and put the phone in the car
The camera wtff
Will the iPhone 14 p fit in my iPhone 12 Pro cases
Im upgrading from my green 13 pro max to the deep purple 14 pro max purely because Im a massive tart
"As a photographer I must admit that those are the most beautiful pictures Ive seen coming from a smartphone Weve reached a point in which our phones AI is our personal photographer all we gotta do is point and shoot and everything after that will be decided be the phones AI That sure is a bit annoying for whomever wants more creative control over their pictures and the fact that these phones AI will always focus on providing quality over reality sometimes I just want to freeze time by taking a picture not the extremely sharp extremely processed HDR and saturated version of reality that the AI will provide me but we got RAW and the option to turn off most of these things I guess So Im not complaining
All that said I DREAM with the day apple makes a dedicated camera Can you imagine all that software power in a good fullframe camera Its safe to say that this iPhone with its limited camera hardware has the BEST camera software even compared to the most expansive mirrorless SLRs nowadays so imagine what apple could do with a great camera hardware I know that will probably never happen but who knows hehe"
"In iPhone 13 Pro when taking a video in 1x and switching to 3x sometimes it takes forever to focus or doesnt focus at all 

This problem is exaggerated when you try to take videos from airplane windows and car windows 

The phone focuses on the glass and its really challenging to get it to focus on a far away object 

I really hope this will be fixed in iPhone 14 pro 

While recording the only smooth transition is between 05x and 1x 1x to 3x is extremely glitchy and is a hit or miss"
Bro Check your emails 
The no physical sim is definitely a deal breaker for me I travel a lot and keep a few sim cards for different countries that I frequent
A new phone for a new year Thats whats wrong with society
naah pass on this one
How did nobody notice the dynamic island and the fact the MKB HD is very famous How
Smartphone are now media consumption devices Videos and games are a big part of the dat to day usage Having a cute notification component does not change the fact it is intrusive
1023 secret message
Dynamic Island is like what LG had with their V10 and Samsung had on their first Note Edge
move the notch few millimetres down  Dynamic island apples vision of industry leading innovation
Its distracting how the blacks are different around the island
If 48MP give you 12MP then 2x zoom gives you nothing more than 3MP
Im upgrading to the 14 pro max from an XS Max It feels worth it to me so aside from the newest stuff Ill be getting double the storage MagSafe a new case design and so on But I can totally see how if youre on an 1113 it might be less worth it Great video as always
Anyone got the wallpaper hes been using
Can someone take their new iPhone and go crash it in autotopia at Disneylandthanks
Great reviewer
The dynamic notch is cool but they drop down menu and notifications still suck compared to Android
The eSim thing annoys me more than anything else Im one of the few that rely on swapping sims out The EU should switch their fight against the Lightening port to eSims
You got the update to cinematic mode wrong It was 1080p 30 fps only before and supports 4k in 30 AND 24 fps now At least according to the Apple event
mark ass brownie
2 In Trending
Its funny that iphone14pro there is 1k and in our country its atleast 14k which kinda makes it hard to afford 
Im pretty sure people will test the crash on tik tok like bomb
Ive been traveling recently using esim and is by far easier than having to buy a sim card on the airport there are apps that will help you to install a local esim card of almost any country it takes 5 min and the moment the plane lands youll be already connected avoiding the hassle to have to find a physical sim card
I will upgrade from iphone 13P when iphones come with usbC Right now the 13P is just perfect
"Why would anyone copy the dynamic island when most other phone companies have already come up with better ways to make the front facing camera much more subtle 
I dont believe for a second that the way they expand the island it to add little notifications or whatever makes it useful or less intrusive 
Its simply a gimmick to make it seem like a feature instead of a bug It would obviously be much better if there was no visible notch or cutout at all and all that software information was just put up at the top like a normal notification bar"
What is the music player on 1051
Only someone who knows about the 14 would of noticed you were using the 14
usbc time apple move your damn asses
While I dont like that Apple removed the SIM tray for US models its not the end of the world if youre visiting another country Theres an app called Airalo that lets you buy data plans for other eSIMs embedded on your device They support 190 countries They even have my moms home country Honduras
Cinematic mode already did support 30fps lmao But now it also supports 24
why are the Cameras just sticking out like that it looks Wacky

Question A while ago Google made that feature that makes the skin color more natural and realistic in photos I guess it was called True Tone or something like that Does that actually work tho
I really love you so please dont take this as a negative comment you might not even see it anyways Tbh I dont think you are biased when it comes to reviewing any of Apple products You always are so happy with whatever they present even if it was negligible update even if it was literally nothing as long as its apple then u overreact saying its good or even claim it being the best For example you dedicated a video for watch ultra JUST cuz you said thats what u loved the most in the event even tho for example Samsung had similar watch watch 5 pro But u talked about it for some small part in the Samsung video and thats it cmon man tbh personally I see that apple is but a money hungry company nowadays literally minor to almost 0 upgrades yet you never rate them in a nitpicking way that u do with any other companies Please work on being biased even for companies that u like After all ppl rely on ur opinion to buy mostly expensive tech
Its a horrible design that their just trying to hide Why would anybody copy Now you have to reach to the top to bad for people with small hands 
wow congrats 2 on trending
I would much rather have wider frame on top and cameras and everything in it rather than being on the screen and annoying when doing anything where you can see them especialy when watching movies or videos
mkbhd STOP DOWNLOADING NEW TODO LIST APPS 
Apples AOD looks horrible compared to Samsungs Too bright no customization and more pixels are on at once No wonder the battery life is worse
"Apple truely shows the power of UIUX
They have hardware like phones from 4 years ago but can make it look new"
No SIM card  Im out  I travel for work and swap SIMs between countries 68 times a year
Lame review No low light camera or video No comparison with other competing products and declaring it to have the best camera Verge review is at 180 degree of this
Yeah Apple made the main upgrade on camera so you can take more pictures and buy more iCloud storage 
My man just admitting he broke the NDA Haha I kidkinda
So its the same thing as last year end of story
still no notification led
First  of the first 10000
The new Iphone should just come with a cracked screen Will eventually crack anyway Then on the commercial they can call it the dynamic fault line or something and iphone cultists will eat that crap up
What about the fact prices have gone up all around teh world
Interesting compare a new chipset to a 3 year old chipset Trash much
7 to 14 pro 
Slide it on a railslider and put bump stops at the end of the rails and whip it
This phone is dope like seriously so amazing glad u reviewed it
The Dynamic Island immediately reminded of my old LG V10 that phone was so cool for the time what a shame LG fell off so hard
DI smudge magnet for camera and the sensors
Sir I had a 13 Promax and played with the settings wen I gamed on it modern stink on line THE PHONE WAS UNGODLEY FAST PS YOU DO GRATE REVEWS
Who buys a phone for this dynamic island lol what Aint no one copying this LMAO
BORING
Im going from the SE to this Man its going to be a big change
so how much are they paying him when he said when you drop your dbrand case such a shameless plug
The Holy notch sounds better than dynamic island
None of these phones are worth the price sorry
Still repping my 11 pro max Who with me
Great video Do you think iPhone 15 Pro will have a new design The 14 Pro looks the same as the 12 and 13 Pro  Im thinking whether its worth the upgrade or just get the M2 Air with my money instead Currently torn
Hows your knee bro
From being Android Fanboy to being an Apple sheep Mkbhd has changed a lot
People just want to much in this world not youre not I dont give a fuck Ill buy an apple no matter what because its way better than Samsung at least from my experiences
Hey KB can you have a more complex rubiks cube in the background One that looks more interesting than the standard cube
Wait copied  Samsung makes the screens for iPhone
I got the 13 Pro Max last year and honestly I dont think Im gonna upgrade for a while iPhone 14 Pro just seems like a simple update compared to 13 Pro max which got a lot of stuff especially the bigger battery Also if the rumours are true that USB C might be coming for all iPhones next year then more reason to just wait
Whats the wallpaper
the car crash detect feature is only turned on when it thinks youre in a car so in other words youd have to drop it 20 feet while driving inside your car so technically you could test it but not likely
Theres nothing better than real life test The best way to test the SOS feature is to drive a car of a cliff at 70 miles per hour with the phone in your pocket
A creative solution
To the guy named Lens with 500 comments Well youre exremely wrong
always has been
I hope its not copied it looks ugly
This video is way too long  boring
"Jesus Christ Can Save You

Ooooh dynamic island is so good to be used with one hand Not
so if i have a 11 rn is it better to go to 13 pro or 14 pro
Space black Looks gray to me smh
Its the same thing lmao
thanks god u can shut off the always on display that was going to make me get the regular 14 instead of the pro its honestly such a dumb concept
It might be brilliant It still looks terrible
Knee PT
"I actually love the way the dynamic 
 iland  works The only thing that could have made the new iPhone better would have been type C I guess next year theyll have to"
Does it collect fingerprints on or around the camera While using dynamic island
Ignore the fact he dropped a 1000 phone like its normal
And theres still a notch
always on display always seemed kinda stupid to me Why would I want my screen to be on when Im not using it I can check the time with my watch if I dont have my watch on I can just tap my screen not that big of a deal If I want to check anything else like notifications the screen comes back on anyways and if I want to do anything with music on the lock screen Ill probably be turning the screen on and using it in my hand anyways
The AOD is just a dimming feature it doesnt turn off the pixels I say like you it doesnt make sense to me
Still cant see battery percentage tho
CNET reports preorders for the iPhone 14 flopped worse than the iPhone 13 mini lol I wonder why Here we are iOS 16 and I still cant edit phone numbers within the phone keypad A pain when youre overseas and need to dial long numbers Like seriously But Dynamic Islandgive me a break Also it probably wasnt a good move to switch to eSIM only
One of your very best reviewsever And when you mentioned how the camera handles dark skin tonesI should know I had to chuckle a bit
Hoodie looks sweet still no tall sizes though
I just need to text and call folks
If your phone falls and you dont pick it up in 3 seconds are the police called
Wait what you mean the cienmaric mode has 4k 30fps now because 100 the iphone 13 pro has 30fps but it was only 1080p 
Has he problem about the dimming of display when youre gaming or the phone is too hot 
"I think the Dynamic Island is just top notch 

 Ill just see myself out"
Hi Marques sorry but you are wrong LockScreen can be customized in many ways Try long pressing the screen in lock mode when the screen is already on You can quickly change custom lock screens You can also add many different small widgets to the lock screen They are also customizable cheers
Ill never buy any of these iPhones ever until the lighting port is gone and no stupid island
815 What does the app No Cell coverage do and why does it take 19 of the battery do to that
should I upgrade my iPhone X to an IPhone 14 pro
What are those dots on the left widget on the lock screen Some kind of binary watch or 
Wallpaper link plz
"Great review as always 
I have an iPhone 13 Pro and I wont be upgrading now until Apple release USBC in their iPhones which will probably be iPhone 1516 now

The dynamic island sounds like a great feature but I think its going to be like the Touch Bar on MacBooks
Sounds great in principle but not something a lot of people will use

Hoping Apple will completely phase out the pill or cut out"
When other phones are getting rid of the notch and putting their cameras under the display the iPhone still sells you a Dynamic Island and lightning port so you take forever to transfer your files Wow amazing Im in shock Good job Apple
Apple 
Right so its a bunch of features i never have to use but the actually useful physical sim card is gone Take my money
Does anyone recommend  having a case on these new iPhones I am most worried about the camera getting scratched without one because of the bump
Abeg just give me Samsung
Im tired of reviewers talking about the price but ignoring the fact that prices are higher EVERYWHERE ON EARTH BUT IN THE STATES
It would be great if you could disable the dynamic island I want the pro version but hate the idea of using this thing
I like the idea of the dynamic island but I think the pill punch hole is just a little to big
so apple made a notification bar a tap on the notification bar in Android and all this comes with
You are so right mark my words the dynamic island will be copied by Chinese phones absolutely no doubt lol those Chinese phones really into apple design and software for years 
I have the Iphone 13 pro and will not be upgrading for a long time it is so good
Im gutted they are not making a Product Red Iphone 14 pro and pro max 
WE SEE THE NEW HASSELBLAD MARQUES
Shoutout to the guy who called marques using the pill as the i in iPhone 
I think it looks similar to iPhone 11 difference is screen size
Ive had the same crash detection tech on my motorbike since 2018 Ive only had one false alarm which wasnt really a false alarm anyway so Id say it should work fine Theres a window of time to test a PLB via the satellite network so it should be able to be tested without annoying emergency services too
Its called an island because no one can reach it Please dont put multitasking related controls at the top software developers I think a task pane at the bottom would be much easier to use
I have 11 pro max and Im thinking to upgrade to 14 plus but i guess i just keep my 11pro max because 14plus has no 120hz Im not a camera person so its not worth the upgrade
I may have to upgrade from my 12 pro cause I was dumb and forgot to up my storage 
Sounds like a job for Adam Savage
Samsung will be the first to copy this who consistently mocks Apple for not being able to keep up
What if iPhone completely destroyed in car crash    Will it still be able to detect a car crash  Probably NO
In the begginning everyone laugh about apples dynamic island and the esim features a few months later you see multiple brands copying this features dont be surprised that happened before with the charger not included in box
These cameras keep getting more fragile 
People are forgetting the fact they will literally have to wipe the front camera every time they need it because its so much in the way with all the dynamic island stuff going on
"8 hours and you have 31 mil views
God damn"
"1600 wow it made what the Nokia Pureview 808 did 10 years ago with the 41 Mp sensor carl zeiss with a zoom in pixel or choose to take full size picture Choose between 25 or 8 mega pixel
Crop so 2 to 5 time zoom And if you dont zoom you had benefits of noise reduction with intelligent pixel combined A photograhy jewel forgotten The last true Nokia Kept this phone 5 year and it serve still right now"
Marques spend some money and get a manicure Oh and great review Thanks 
Sorry i dont buy this shit
Had 3 iPhones over 6 years and bored shitless with them now Love my iPad hate my MacBook Air  sold my Apple Watch as couldnt last a full day without charging And wtf do I care about these bloody nits Last time I had nits was primary school
"Am I allowed to post comments on this channel

Anyway Lets see Im getting the Pro Max for the wife but Im turning off the always ON I dont trust that it wont have burnin I want to see first"
Seems like TOK cycle phone I have a 13 Pro Max and will pass on this The dynamic island is a good way to use that space
Why always on display is not available for IPhone 13 series
lol  looks old they took a backstep
im upgrading from a s8 good choice maybe esim might a a hassle
wait thats how AOD usually worked on Android Thats not always on display thats just change to clock for maintain low battery How is that a brag point of we did it first Who wanted that
Crash detection and Satellite are what sold me my family and I travel and hike in rural places
Lightning port is the dealbreaker for me  thanks for mentioning it Hoping for USBC next year so I can switch after 15years
So apple took tech from a 10 year old ides from a company who makes the the best tvs They call it dynamic island and tell people its new innovation and honestly the pill island seems to be more in the way then the notch they we all want gone for a complete clean look At least they upgraded the camera  say 
"I have the wonderful iPhone 11 Pro With IOS 16
NONE of that stuff seems to appear to me here WTH am I missing
BTW no regular SIM CardIm OUT"
Kek the Dynamic Island is dumb
agreed
No way in hell is anyone copying thisI cant believe people think this is a good idea Its intrusive as F
1813 we can see that Marques Apple Watch is apart of his body
How to get that Calendar Widget
GL
How can I get that wallpaper on the iPhone
"Still remember when Huawei launch telephoto lens all YouTubers said is this for spying 
And when vivo launch gimbal came they said its gimmick 
But when Samsung or iphone launch these zoom lens or gimbal now thats a new and great feature"
"The DI the best way to say dynamic island di  is where its at 
it made useless space useful 
That feature is the bomb   Cant wait for it to arrive on Friday
Im always happy to see when your videos drop already watched it Thanks"
Top notch video edit and dynamic intro Pun Intended 
We bougt iphone 14 pro last year with 13pro almost same and shame
Anyone know what speed cube is in the background I really like the colors 
Can I get the link to the wallpaper on the iphone in this Video
Bye bye iPhone 7 finally
In Sweden the baseline 14 pro is the equivalent of just over 1400
Can you turn off the always  on display
The hell is up with this no sim could buy an iP when visiting the US cause its waaaay cheaper there but I cant anymore because of this Some serious bs
damn what a damn legend you are bro 305 to 332
Can you imagine if a cop has a iPhone and the cop is going real fast then triggers the auto emergency service call 
its as if apple release these things such as aod and not give us any customizable features until the jailbreakers give them ideas
Always on display Apple throws in a domestic violence feature Classic
yesssss this intro
The always on display is going to have the hardcore apple people saying oh wow I bet android people wish they had that apple is so innovative
Its funny how much press the car crash detection is getting  Pixel has had that for at least a year or two
So Apple copied the dynamic island 
No imessage display in the dynamic island lol
All I got from this was Marques still bumping that Born Sinner That album is a classic
1326 GODDAMNIT LG
miss that intro for a long time
no teardown vid at the moment
Anybody noticed he said connecting air pods twice 1106 to 1114
Marques opening his bank account and letting us barley see the top of the number is probably his biggest lowkey flex of the year
how do you get this month overview as a widget on the lockscreen
Hold on let me get this straight yall over tripping over that dynamic island feature like its never been done before  Steve Jacobs must be laughing his ass off frome beyond
Being able to see the timer on the DI is a game changer for me Worth it all
Maybe its a nEw York tang but those seagull sounds had me
Im picking up my iPhone 14 Pro Max in gold tomorrow and Im so excited Im finally upgrading from my 8 Plus 
Im sorry but It looks nice yeah but its 1 still just a band aid for a hardware deficit and 2 super annoying that it moves every interaction to the top Like now youll need two hands to take a call Lol Apple fans eat everything raw
Apple ui is Always top notch
So basically there selling you the iPhone 13 again this year Save your money buy a Samsung
This is the ugliest notch on a phone Period
HOODIES SEASON OFFICIALLY KICKED OFF
Wish they went with atleast 8gb ram but Im sure iphone 15 will have next year
Apple way all the way God forbid they complicate stuff with customization Lock screen is too much Not needed at all
Pill cutout is worse than a notch
No it wont be copyis just a patch for their cutoutmost companies are alreadypushing to hide camera under the screen
4 hours screen active time Isnt that bad
you mean it is copied 
Will the front camera not get blurry overtime if your thumb is touching it every time i mean my thumbs are relatively clean but not always
One plus7 pro pop up camera was a game changer 
"The dynamic island reminds me a lot of the second screen that was on the top of the LG V10 ages ago It was an incredibly useful feature on that phone but the microbezel trend kind of killed it

EDIT just realized you said the same thing later in the video lol"
tell us about the wallpaper on your iPhone in this video  where can we get it
Iphone 14 pro max 
So heres the thing I could sell my 13 Pro and upgrade to the 14 Pro Max for an extra 300 Its tempting but is it worth it
My exercise detection never works I worked  out for an hour before I realized it wasnt on
No SIM tray yet the battery got slightly smaller
maybe Im the only one but it seems annoying
you know i thought i would be so sold with this new phone after their presentation oh my god apple can really market stuff you dont really need but i am really pumped for the apple watch ultra review  to really tell you the truth the minute i saw the hoodie i was just concentrating on it the whole time that i kinda wish i was able to buy it please Marques dont ever kill this hoodie so i can be able to buy it in the future when i have  money
How about if youre on a roller coaster Will that trigger the sensor
iPhone 11 doesnt get the battery percentage and haptic keyboard with the new iOS update
Ill call it a DI
Does using the accessibility feature that brings the screen down bring the pill with it as well for easier 1 hand access
iPhone Xs upgrading to this soon 
My iPhone 11 barley works
Damn it Andrew were filming right now 
gotta love the extra touch of the birds chirping when Marques brings up the dynamic island D kudos to the audio team
Let us all hope and  dynamic island makes its way to watch ultra 2 iPads MacBooks
Keep up the intros they are amazing
I will upgrade from my 2020 SE once a Full screen iPhone is released
Love how Marcus mentioned how Apple compared the chip from 2019
The probably dont have a sim try in US phones is because Apple wants to restrict people buying phones in the US for a cheaper price and selling it in another country
I always cringe at the price but never at the quality 
One thing about the dynamic island that I dont like is the fact that when your using it your getting the camera dirty and messing up the quality when tapping that island Still cool tho
why the fuck am i watching this i cant even afford it
"It really bothers me that no one is giving more attention to the lack of sim card Every video Ive seen of this phone only briefly touches on the lack of sim card and its a way bigger deal than most people would think The lack of sim card means that cell companies have a lot more control over your phone With a sim card a cell company can only shut down your sim they cant touch your phones functionality Whereas without a sim card a cell company could in theory shut down that phones ability to connect to any cell towers with no way of you fighting it This is not a far fetched idea either Just earlier this year ATT tried to force me into switching cell phones because of their switch to VOTLE even though my phone supported VOTLE and 5g just fine They threatened to shut down my phone if I didnt switch over to some piece of crap Samsung Galaxy s9 that they sent me to use and I threatened them with a lawsuit if they tried anything well sure enough some time in February they did indeed shut down my sim for a few days and while I was resolving the issue legally I was able to just simply switch sim cards so I could continue to make phone calls and perform business as usual If I had this or any other phone with no sim card ATT could very well have shut down my phones IMEI from connecting to a cell tower and prevented me from just using another carrier to side skirt their abusive behavior

Bottom line a phone with no sim card is a massive step backwards and should be a huge red flag for anyone and NEEDS to be talked about more"
"Woo hoo  Bionic
Dun dun dun dun dun dunnnnn

Gentlemen and fruits we can rebuild it We have the technology We have the capability to make the worlds first bionic phone iPhone 14 will be that phone Better than it was before Better  stronger  faster More expensive too Pay weekly become in debt  youll be the envy of all your friends for a day or two Then youll be lumbered with a contract This item can be yours

Buy it and enter our world Well not exactly but shhhhh dont tell anyone Were selling you shite made in China you will look cool owning renting it though to some

Steve Austin would approve"
"I was able to walk around take pictures text people pay for things with Apple payand nobody noticed

When you test the iPhone 15 next year look out "
Amazing job again and again Keep up with the great videos
What case are you using
I just got a 99 Honda civic with 122k miles for 1200 bucks
What is knee PT
LGs shortcut bar was more usable because the entire display could be used The Island has a large dead space in middle Responds to touch Thats it No display
My Galaxy watch thinks Im doing a workout when I walk home from the pub
Note to self  go see Marques the week after next years iPhone launch
True tap for the widget and Long press for the app
Is everyone now looking for LG V10 old video Any good links
For the car crash its similar and even better than inflated air autonomous motorcycle jacket It uses sensors and gps to make difference with throw the jacket or actually riding a motorcycle Normally no panick for those who like to throw their phones  on your bed of course im not a savage 
The Dynamic Island IS a notification bar I really dont like it Id buy the pro for the camera But Im gonna pass cos of that island  plus finger prints all over the front facing camera This was not a good idea  just like the Touch Bar wasnt a good idea
I drop my phone so much or it falls off the recliner all the time I just hope it doesnt always call emergency services because I dropped it when I get my 14 pro max
upgrading from iphone 12 pro max
A little flex yeah we notice that you have he new hasselblad 
I currently have the XS Max and I pre ordered a 14 Pro Max XS Max wont charge via cable anymore And I cracked the screen Also photography is my number one concern So if I can muster up a little more cash I wont return it
Can someone explain to me the appeal of always on display Especially when wearing a watch what does it add
Am I insane or is everything the dynamic island does just a fancier version of android popup notifications
It could detect a car crash the watch can scan your blood oxygen and they all have features well hardly every use but they cant figure out how to add a fg thermometer to take my temperature or other useful features such st
I use a iPhone 11 Pro Max 256 gbs and I am happy dont need to switch to the new phone any time soon Sometimes I see that People using an iPhone 5 these days thats kind of old school I probably wait till there no notch and usb c
This will be copied by samsung Lmao
as someone who drives for delivery services full time the dynamic island is going to be a game changer for me being able to easily switch between music navigation and my actual work apps is going to be significantly easier for me
So you basically breached the NDA
The SEAGULL SOUNDS at 847 mark  LOL
watching this just makes me miss LG and rue how they could have been so great if they had known how to market properly and had more reliable and seamless softwarehardware Often their ideas are ahead of the hardware
Glad you gave LG its props LG definitely contributed a lot of creative ways we use our smart phones
I m a Dynamic Island Boy
See you in 12 months for USB C
dynamic island makes me laugh every time i dont mind it free laughs
"Why would anyone want to copy an overdone overdressing to hide an outdated a stupid pill shaped a gap in their screens

Yeah Chinese are the exceptions because theyre human Xerox machines but still this is living proof of how Apple is an overvalued outdated company that lives on locking in sheep into their ecosystem

Meanwhile Im watching this on an unfolding 76 inch screen with a hidden camera below the screen

What a joke indeed"
I think a big cons of the dynamic Island is that it forces you to touch it continuously thus dirtying the camera sensor below
Dynamic Island is just one step away from a notification with a constant dark gap in the middle For me its a gimmick And the screen real estate it needs is just too much on your face and ruins things like gaming and video watching
Cries about no AOD on an iPhone finally comes and he doesnt care 
The face of that doggie 
Not gonna lie the visualsmusic of the video feels odd Not fully polishedclean Idk what exactly but something is a bit off Maybe the video was rushed Not to complain but to provide feedback still a thumbsup from me thank you for all the work
So To sum up you got a bigger notch with a software to that force you to put fingerprints on the front sensor The same software thatll be unusable on pro max The same iphone you got last year but more expensive Im so sorry for you guys
yo bro is fliming a spotted lantern fly like its all good  they are a invasive species in the east coast of the usa
Lets Be Honest on this guysMost Of U tech guys on youtube U review with Details on these Mobile features But I think U are All bias There Are somethings In Ur reviews Like Ur Forcing To make Apple products to be better because U are Mostly Use it but to be honest Apple its Behind Samsung From Many Aspects I have Both 14pro and s22 Ultra truthfully s22 ultra is Mile better with Great Features than Iphone 14 pro
1505 Me a non professional photographer hearing all the new camera specs and capabilities
But does it auto Dim in the sun even when you have every setting on your phone off
Car crash detection has been on Pixel phones for ages it sucks that doesnt even get a mention
can we have the lock sceen change to the music cover like on iphone 3 cause that was a very nice feature
I see it in foldables phones already but it havent come out yet
Does it still have that weird lens flare in video mode Thats my only complaint since iPhone 11
Wondering how selfies would look like with all the smudges from touching that Dynamic Island
nice hasselblad x2d humble brag
Y is this video seem like no real effort was put in
I thought he was a nfl player
Whats with the clamp
SIGH oh to find unbiased reviews of Apple products Youre one of the few Also many other phones manage to have great cameras without ugly absurd sized lenses
Let them know Apple is dishing out old Android technology and milking the industry 
The edits on this video are refreshing 
I despise the look of the island notch thing It takes the problems with the whole punch and the notch and none of the benefits Hole punch is ugly but super unintrusive That benefit is lost when the whole punch is the size of a notch The notch was nice because it stayed connected to the bezels arguably nicer looking That benefits lost by making it float Not a fan To be fair to Apple they needed to change their display design Its been a gripe of many for years I just think its ugly
What does dynamic island loon when you invert screen colors
A gimmick phone Dynamic island is a novelty feature and everything else is an extremely minor upgrade even for apples standards
1819 That dog look  Great video as usual
Colorful vid
where is nitpicking MKBHD
"nothing wow about 14pro
Marques trying to hard to promote it
its not worth an upgrade from 12pro or 13pro"
I will just wait for iPhone 15 to be honest as there is nothing special to upgrade from 13 to 14 
at this  point  I dont care about the reviewed product I just love to watch an MKBHD video before going to bed
1246 You poke the cutout and it wobbles and moves around like its alive
Looks fine to me All these nerds complain about the notch being there Its like dogs whining
battery is missing dear mkbhd
"Just more data Automatic car crash reporter for everyone elses GPS 

Also i bet they could assist in suspicious activity Make it look like an accident"
Racist phone 1804
Haha dude your skin is just a tanyour risk is the evidence 1812
Am i the only one who thinks that is is extremly stupid that new smartphones got notches now for no reason My xiaomi mi 9t is like 3 Years old and doesnt have one I dont get it Or am im missing something here
as far as I can remember apple copied LG when it comes to that top notch implementation but apple implemented it off the charts
Love the content This video has way too many adds though I used to appreciate how your videos would start straight away with no adds and maybe have one add break in the middle
Where can I get that iPhone wallpaper
If the phones screen is turned down screen on a table does the screen turn off completely How about at night
I kinda like the idea of Dynamic Island but I wish they would work on truly meaningful changes to the OS At first they should come up with a whole new design of the UI It was ugly and uninspired from the start with iOS 7 nine years ago
whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy they disable live photo on the lock screeeeeeeennnnnnnnn dammmmnnnnnnnn i want it backkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
I wonder if the Dynamic Island still functions when you use OneHanded Mode
Im usually not one to complain about apples aesthetics but am I the only one that thinks that camera bump finally went too far
I have had 3 samsung phones in a row and want something a bit differently Currently I have a s21 plus and I might get the USB c version of this iphone My s21 plus is amazing and perfect but its so boring lol even my old s10 plus had a more interesting design I feel this iphone 14 pro max has alot of character my last iPhone was iPhone 6 and I did enjoy that phone and the design of that phone was super nice back then Then I got s8 and it blew me away I found it super modern S10 plus was like a bigger s8 and I loved that s21 plus is great but it doesnt seem special but will try hold onto it as long as I can
30fps is NOT cinematic
I honestly think that the Dynamic Island is another classic Apple move of screw you
But what happens if it falls out of your pocket when youre on a rollercoaster Will it call emergency services If it still works oc
I guess Ill stick with the 13 Pro Will wait for either 15 or 16 pro line up
Dynamic island is pretty much a gimmick lol
Lot of copys from LG old tech
"Finally Bro waiting for this review from you 
Thanks   "
What about fingers prints over camera  island
If mk will say this iPhone is good then for the first time i will disagree with mk cuz before watching Im sure all new iphones all are worse they got nothing good especially since many years iPhone looks like garbage iPhone used to be very beautiful phone to look at from man years iPhones are just ugly to look at puke dont even wanna look at iPhone no more from so many years specially theyll never get rid of ugly notches
Are you able to get thru the whole day without charging
Remember to floss Marques
Dynamic island is not a reason to get one over the other but apple is trying to widen the gap between regular iPhones and pro versions and knows little things like that will add up Otherwise they wouldve made the notch and the area around it Dynamic Peninsula or something
1TB pro max is USD 2100 where I live
Love that intro song Max Fredriksson gang
That hoodie fly my guy
THERE WAS A GUY IN THE WAVEFORM COMMENTS THAT PREDICTED THIS INTRO Fucking legend Hope hes seen this
How the heck does he get a custom Copilot icon
Can someone tell me how he put the left calendar widget on the lockscreen I have an iPhone 13 mini Might that may be the reason I dont have the function
bla bla blafancy words  same phone no mayor changes all apple fans happy 
Merci MKBHD 
Love the hoodie  Snagged one
Dam that intro song is such a throwback
"Like Apple copies everyone else 

Im glad iPhones got AOD and 120hz screens 5 years later"
Brilliant content as normal
also a big con of e sim is if you brick your phone you cant just easily put your existing sim into a new phone
Dynamic Island Boy
I preordered it on the weekend but unfortunately I am one those few who have wait till October   Does anyone know if they can send it earlier
this was one of your best reviews bro amazing work 
Apple copies android all the time but i guess we arent allowed to talk about that Im still waiting on apple to implement multiple user profiles and split screen on iphones
Im really gonna feel the difference upgrading from 12 pro max finally gonna get 120hz plus the battery difference is pretty big i would upgrade from the 13 pro max very minor upgrades
Great use of Hocus Pocus samples once again Great video
So the Nexus P had always on display would be interesting to see the history of always on display
All the sheep trading in their iPhone 13 pro and wasting money on the 14 pro after watching this video
Shows the idiocy of the buying public that they buy this bullshit from apple
Sat connectivitylol what a joke Elon musk teamed up with tmobile to allow this already Cmon man keep up with tech
"I despise tiny incremental yearly updates for any software or hardware Adds so much needless ewaste to the world

Same as the iPad which has horrible file management especially outside of interacting with nonapple devices the iPhone needs better file management software and a fast usbc port

Getting any photos and videos into and out of my iPad and iPhone is unreliable slow and complicated"
Do you think J Cole is a tech enthusiast and he comes to this video to watch it and sees his music front and center
Thanks for mentioning LG mobiles contribution to the dynamic island Sad the pioneer is no more and kudos to accept the fact its not worth to upgrade just for the notch And why dont Apple made this notch available for non pro users Apple performance and camera reduced on non pro models is understandable but not the same display is kinda like slapping the iPhone 12 and 13 screens on 14 model and selling it like selling iPhone 8 as iPhone se I bet many prefer the touch Id over the notch And where is the type c Some countries put up fight against Apple to get the charging brick inside the box Many countries must follow this against all smartphone companies
The Multicore performance seems far better we have to remember that Moores Law is dead and this wave of highperforming silicon that started with Apple followed by AMD and soon Intel is an anomaly  17 year over year si fantastic
Dynamic notch
Funny  Cause it was copied  Edge lighting has had that FOREVER
Glad to know that this J Cole fan is still listening to Born Sinner
Who tf is making intros for you Everything is soooo clean
Yeah Apple purposely left the notch big so that there will be something to work on the iPhone 15 and later
I had goosebumps while watching the intro
Yeah Im gonna stick with my Iphone 11 pro for now Still works like a charm
Dude I really just got a samsung add before this lol
Android is way forward than iPhone is just people hype iPhone too much
The 14 does it too
Cmon Marqeus flip that Tesla
My opinion Ill just say it apple has no answer for hiding the front facing camera samsung fold 34 both have under display cameras apple is just covering up making it look like a new feature
Thats considered multitasking Just swiping between apps Lol iphone is seriously still in 2012
Youre hands down the greatest YouTube channel ever from a production quality standpoint Love the content Marques
Amazing phone but still think its worth keeping the 13pro max 
Where can we get this wallpaper
I miss lg phones I havent used a single phone I liked more than the LGV20 Removable battery expandable memory amazing camera and microphones the best ui Come back lg D
Didnt change body design is the dumbest iphone decision yet  Lots of people bought iphone for status in 2nd n 3rd worldnow they dont have reason to change
Ordered this iPhone only to cancel when I realized how little an upgrade it would functionally be over my iPhone 11 Its still going to be another generation or two before I actually feel its truly worthwhile upgrading Spent my money on some AirPods Pro 1 on sale 50CAD off at Best Buy instead and they are by far the best headphones besides my Bose QC 35 IIs I have ever owned Also loving iOS 16 so far
Wont it dirty the camera tho
Switching from 12 pro to 14 pro max
Intro was fire
most impressive thing in this vid is your wordle score
Hello
The real question is can an iPhone 13 pro case fit an iPhone 14 pro Im guessing not because Apple wants you to buy a new case Same reason Apple doesnt include a power adapter
No critics on the dynamic island Strange Like the poor reachability with one hand Everything is on top now With max even worse Or with the amount of touches you gonna dirt the front camera like Ive seen in this video
This will be the worse Iphone for people going abroad or travelers
Cinematic mode was originally only 30fps Whats different now is it also allows for 24fps Which was the weird thing about it originally Cinematic mode is the mode where it should be 24 haha cause thats part of what cinematic is haha but yea it should let us have the choice of framerate
iPhone just dim the display and call it AOD 
No SIM slot The fuck
cheater Apple
Seems kind of lackluster
Great video Cant wait for my Pro Max to get here Hope you killed that spotted lantern fly
Zooming in on a 48 Mp photo is not the same as a full 12 Mp because youre looking at 14 of the light that landed on the sensor Unless the 48 Mp sensor is physically larger ofc
The most boring iphone update to date
i cant see notch on my old s10e because i have no wallpaper only black color background for years on amoled phones P So no problems P
No side by side brightness comparison This is the main selling point of the phone imo
Love when you add the sound of seagull when you highlight the dynamic island in the opening
Hello marques disini
Why does it look like a movie prop to me
Im debating if I want to trade in my Samsung s21 for the new IPhone 14 pro Ive used android mostly Samsung phones most my life I havent had an iPhone in years is this worth trading in my s21 for
1857 You sound like a Minecraft Villager
Graph didnt show the leap lol
Dynamic island is such a great name 
My Ebike does the crash detection thing Its texted my GF when Ive just laid it down
Yuck that things gross
Hear me out What would happen if you were in a car crash in the middle of the desert where there is no cell reception Youre unconscious so will the phone be able to send a message to the satellite if no one can point to it SELFPOSITIONING PHONE Come on Apple
I like how your videos are not too serious but not too playful sweet spot Classics
Apple uses the A13 to show how far behind the competition is
When I go skiing my phone thinks Im driving and goes in drive mode Every time I crash I guess its going to call the ambulance ahh well could be good
1100 in the UK for the regular pro Wow Wont be back to apple anytime soon
Looks same as other models other brands and is SAME Man I miss times when cars phones and pretty much everything didnt fjcng look same and we didnt have  new   but exact same  phones or cars every year
Motorola ads everywhere
can i buy the canada version that comes with the sim card tray and put my sim card in it will it work someone let me know
should i upgrade to 14 pro coz i got 13 pro max 
1801 great selfies my guy
How is the alwayon display a hardware feature and not a software feature
135 bro let your shoes breathe 
When it calls 911 after your crash what does it say to the operator
I think they compared it to the 13 ionic since most people own 1011s and not 12s or 13s so its more of a comparision and to also get more people to buy new phones
trash im going android this year
They knew removing the notch meant compromising camera quality So they left it and made it a feature GENIUS THINK DIFFERENT 
I was playing beach volleyball with my apple watch on and I laid out for a hit which triggered crashfall detection
I think its pretty obvious why they compared it to the A13 Bionic in the diagram the A13 is still ahead of the nearest competitor showing they were already ahead of current 2022 competitors back in 2019 and now it is much more upgraded Not sure how accurate the nearest competitor is but that is most definitely why they showed that
Everything looks normal abnormal
Android copies apple all the time so why not
Pixel has had car crash detection since the 4
Does always on display also turn off if you place your phone down on a table on its screen instead of its back
Every year Im the incredibles bike kid hoping something cool happens 
Dynamic island is no the name of a cut out on the screen like Samsungs punchhole cut out It is the name of the new alwayson infonotification area It just happens to have a UX which interacts with the cut out for the camerasensors
Waiting for your iPhone rant video
Wallpaper please 
All iPhones in rich countries No way much of the world is ready for esim
"I honestly feel like the only thing missing from this phone is a USBC port instead of a Lightning port I still might upgrade from my 12 Pro Max Im also thinking about just getting the Pro While I enjoy the larger screen its honestly a bit cumbersome at times even with decently sized hands

Also the overexposure comment gave me a good laugh"
What calendar Lock Screen widget is that it looks cool
Where do you download your wallpapers
I dont know if the dynamic island is that smart because you will quickly smudge up the camera
Nobody cares bro Drop test it
"Its nice to see Car Crash Detection finally make its way to the iPhone It shows that Google was right in bringing it to Pixel Now more people will be able to have this feature 

Is Car Crash Detection available for older iPhones or do people have to buy a new iPhone to get this feature"
So Space black is the same as space grey We need a matte black
I dont see myself using this feature because I dont want fingerprints on the selfie cam and I like to use my phone with one hand and it will be hard to reach it He looks cool but in reality is it needed I rather have no cut out
1144 eyyy lmao
As an 11Pro user I considered upgrading but decided to hold off for now One thing I liked about apples new update was that you can use your iPhone camera on your Mac for better quality and the whole top down view still dont get how it works but thats super cool Thats one thing I want to learn more about
Did he just drop an iPhone 14 pro on the floor
1139 Battery Percentage Nice
To your point about being in public with an unreleased iPhone I was in South Korea last month and saw a girl on the train with an iPhone with the pill cut outdynamic island I was only looking for a moment as she navigated her homescreen and was so impressed as to how accurate it was for what I thought was a fakecopycat iPhone I kinda wish they did have a pill shape and not the notch I thought to myself Now Im thinking maybe she was just reviewing this
1803 that sounded like you were saying the new iPhone 14 pro camera is racist
I think all of the major carrier here in the US have the option to enable or disable ur international data service  Once u have an esimu can take that feature  Dont quote me on thatcoz for mei have an esim and they have the feature if I will be going out of the country
You could probably test the crash detection by going on a roller coaster or thrill ride that pulls several Gs Maybe the Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland
Hahaha lantern bugs crawling are so weird
First thing Im doing when I get an iPhone 14 is bumper cars
Apple bullshting everybody as always they havent changed their UI in years They didnt change the design almost at all Wtf apple
Whats the calendar widget used on the lockscreen
dynamic island is an interesting name for a shortcut bar shortcut pill
Curious what is the dots widget on the Lock Screen
Mkbhd is a jcole fan
Its hones a really cool phone but Im staying on iPhone Xs
the intros just get better and better
dynamic island seems like a fingerprint magnet which it needs to be cleaned everytime weve to take a selfie or even the face id could be a bummer if thats gonna be affecting the hardware too 
Best explanation for the crash feature  if youre going 60 miles an hour and go to 0
Ive been holding my iPhone XS Max for 4 years now and was really looking forward to upgrading to the 14 Pro Max However the more I digest the details on this release I am feeling less inclined to buy and just wait another year I will be first in line for the new Ultra watch though
126 its 100 degrees lmao
iPhone 15 with the USB C will be the one to get EU will force Apple to do this in 2023
personally i would prefer to have the option to turn pixels in between the front camera to back on it would be nicer for watching video and such
ive had crash detection since pixel 4 lol
marquesbrownlee are you currently in Melbourne FL driving a silver F150 lightning
I am damn sure that I couldnt afford an IPHONE just here for the way you reveal it better than anyone 
"1330 Marques went like Mic drop bh
Gotta love this guy man"
I like the hoodie but I need a 4XL
Thank you for the good review I wont upgrade at any time unless they start using USBC
"apple is trash now 
dont know what the future holds for it
but its trash now"
This is the dopest intro ive ever seen
I used to really like Marques reviews but at this point hes so biased I dont see any point watching
Wanted to see if its esim device within the uk
Little changes but Ill still get it as Im due an upgrade from my 12 and its battery is poo now
Ive heard this is the last time Im calling it Dynamic Island so many times from tech youtubers only for them to continue calling it Dynamic Island
I am very sure that there will be a company that will copy it
traaaaash
When I close the flip 4 notifications time and temp plus widgets do the same thing If someone calls and it recognizes the face itll accept it and you dont have to flip it open to talk to the person just holding it as is Its not as bulky and compact and I just feel its sleeker
Jesus those intros are straight 
I dont care much if there is a notch or less of it I just want the 3D Touch back 
So the esim will only be in the us
"I would have been more than happy to use my 13 Pro Max for another year till I saw Dynamic Island 
Ill have a play when the demo units reach the stores but Im 99 sold already"
his videos cure depression like wtf
Not having a physical sim tray its going to make this hell for individuals that work for cell phone companies activating phones Also individuals wont be able to easily change their SIM cards anymore Most will have to go into stores now to have it done for them which is incredibly inconvenient for the consumer and for the individual working at the cell phone store People that work at these stores know that customers are tracked when they come in the store and if they dont sell the customer anything they have to hear it from their like 12 bosses Deeming that customer amissed opportunity It even results in less money on their paycheck
I know that you do this as your living and fair enough but you seem to be trying to make chicken salad from chicken shit more or less Apple is one of the most anticonsumer companys on the planet The utter retarded name  Dynamic Island How can we draw attention away from the notch out of 2016 LOL Lets not forget Apple is still using the utter shit lighting cable in 2022 just so you can spend more money on worthless shit that you should not need to do as USB type C is FAR superior in every respect I find it hard to understand why people keep purchasing this crapIf you own a iPhone 13 do not even bother as you are just throwing your money down the Damn toilet as its the same shit more OR less
Someone needs to put the phone in an RC car and crash the car into a wall and see what happens
1604 Marques you gotta stomp those spotted lanternflies
"Great review 
That soft flex with the new Hasselblad was noticed "
Yooo you got those stupid ladybug lookin flies too
Respect my Lg v10 miss you
seems like such a minimal upgrade i would rather get the 13 pro just for the price and battery upgrade
I still kinda wish it was i and not l
Yay new colors At least Apple is making it easier for me not to spend my money recklessly and only upgrade every 45 years lol
That intro was freaking dope 
waiting for usb c iphone not buying period
Am i the only one thinking that the dynamic island will smudge a lot of fingerprints on the front camera affecting the picture quality unless its cleaned everytime before taking a picture
I think worst thing you need two hand to use dynamic island
Its not even that bad of a name in my opinion
What are the widgets on the Lock Screen the one on the left looks interesting
dam just saw mine was delayed and wont ship till the 16th but its 2 day shipping so thats not bad
Lmfao that Apple Watch tan line tho 
Cant wait to get my iPhone 14 Pro Max 
Youre an Island Boy now 
"Another Great review mkbhd however I like how a few years ago many tech reviewers used to complain about bezel size cut holes and things getting in the way of the viewer

On the iPhone 14 pro when you watch video full screen or try to play any game full screen or use certain applications in landscape mode the D island gets in the way and does give a bad experience

Idk if tech reviewers are being asked by Apple not to criticize the D island when used in those cases but just seems really fishy not to call that out as a bad experience

Theres literally a pill cutout that ruins movie  YouTube  gaming experience"
I will also not be testing that XD
Cinematic mode was already 30 fps and only 30 That was the problem To appeal to anyone wanting a cinematic look it shouldve been 24 which the iPhone was already capable of They added 24 this year Having both options in the way to go though 24 and 30 have their use cases and fancy stuff like Cinematic Mode should be available to both 
It seems Apple have used the extra pixels way better than Google have done with the Pixel 6
Lovee the intro hope we get a studio video on it
25 million views in 7 hours 
At least its something practical and that will work Unlike some other unnamed company that puts a ton of gimmicks on their phones that dont work
Watching the 14 on my iPhone 7 What a gap
What happens with the dynamic island if you have more than 2 background apps
Apple wowed everyone first its about all that matters Copy away and Apple wins
Lol maybe one way to test the crash detection is to put an iPhone inside a ball  throw it  have some one catch it Or if youre crazy enough  if its even possible you can have a baseball pitcher throw it at the catcher 
Your body language says it a lot Probably the first time I have seen you reviewing an iPhone and not hyped about it In other words underwhelmed with the incremental upgrades but just attempting to not show it
Hey you are privileged MKBHD How come you have the latest iphone lol
"Paying with the Apple Pay
Ah miss those times
Hi from Russia"
or like when I start Shaking hands with the milkman and my apple watch thinks Im running a marathon No just me
It is the same  phone same to same as iphone 12 no difference
Man 1630 for iphone 14 pro is tough choice in India I hate touching camera top down pull is always best and compatibility issue while charging with usbc with mac charger is also seems intentional and thats what i hate about apple I think will wait for Pixels
Looks like the same music Lol
Dynamic island is a gimmick that people will start saying looks ugly when the next iPhone decides they dont need it anymore
"There is one instance in this video where the lens he is recording with has what appears to be a dust smudge in it 

Good luck trying to find it
Let me know if you find it 

Great video though 
Marques I love the quality you put into your videos Both the content and the cinematography of your vids are incredible"
I hope one day we will get to see Apple Annonce the New iPhone with one of its features being the brand new USBC features
Amazing intro
I spy the new Hasselblad cant wait for that one
You have the cutest fucking dogs
Is the music from Hocuspocus 
These videos are such a masterpiece Amazing cinematic quality
Shit phone No new features All iphone worths around 500
Awesome summary Keep it going
1553 hoped you killed that lantern fly after taking this shot
This is the only time the notch is actully useful
wait for iphone 15 with usb c
That is clutch I will also not be testing that 
"Will you testreview the Mate 50 ProRS
From the comparisons I saw so far it seems very competitive and almost similar to the iPhone 14 Pro"
I noticed throughout the video the battery percentage icon will stay full with the number on it However at 0145 the icon changes to red with the number 15 I forget but does the battery icon change when you go below 20 Also SOLID REVIEW Thank you for always creating top quality videos
I own a I phone 7plus dont feel the need to upgrade
Im excited to see this phone in the wild
Does anyone have a link to the wallpaper he shows here
the AOD will create screen burn issues as the content is static and dies not move unlike the android counterparts
Look its just a more preductive punchhole Apple has always gone out of their way to make hardware and software work seemlesly and also add some stupid features in the mix while theyre at it Will other companies turn their punchholes into widgets Yes because its a decent idea Not an amazing one tho
If the screen was significantly smaller the dynamic island would be very useful but with this massive phone it is located in a very weird place to touch If you could 1 hand this it would be sick
That takes forever to get off this iPhone via this lightning port with the slow speed 
What is wrong with your knee
The notch being gone feels kind of weird it was so apple
So you reused your music like apple reuses their tech and yet everyone praises them for innovation 
Bangladesh
I loved that IPHONE 14 PRO text that came from the notch
Hey MKBHD how about teaming up with Matt from Car Wow and see yall could get the iphone to trigger via a break test with cars that have the best breaks according to his testing I think it would make a pretty good collab video Lol
what is that home screen widget with the dots  643 
This is a good time for TECHRAX to come back and test the car crash detection
14 iphones later and people are still dumb enough to buy the same phone
So now a small update is now called a refined update  And you should buy it if you have a thousand dollars burning a hole in your pocket Hmmm
Rip LG
Nice video even though the phone is rather boring however I have to admit that I do not know anymore what kind of change Id want or even find exciting
Waiting for the s23 before I make a move on this
iOS 16 is well polished yet still missing out on significant features like 5th row in the keyboard enter pin code to shut down and splits screen multitasking on the PlusPro versions
What I dont understand is what if your on a rollercoaster with the phone and it thinks your in a car crash Is there an option to turn that off
i wanna be like Marques when i graduate highschool
Take it on a rollercoaster or bumpercars
Lets call it the DI so we dont have to say the cringe Dynamic Island 
Theres a bunch of new super nice features and im a big fan of the Dynamic Island but its so anoying that most of these cool things are only on the ProMax and they are super expensive Its cool but not worth the price according to me
What about Dynamic Island in landscape mode
Love the intro Been missing them recently
The satellite thing is not just for when youre randomly lost but is also useful for when you go camping or hiking up mountains It may replace the Garmin GPS devices which are 15 a month sub
make sure you do your KNEE PT
As an S22 Ultra user I gotta admit they are moving in the right direction I still prefer my phone though
The 14 has the same chip as the 13 just buy the 13 guys
2154 This is a huge change I would even argue the biggest and most important change to the iPhone this year
I dont understand why apple cant just make a tiny one whole cutout just for the front camera ever since the galaxy s20 Samsung has tiny front camera cutouts Been thinking about switching to iphone but this dynamic island is a total gimmick Just give me a tiny cutout and let me use the rest of the screen for more video watching real estate etc
Are there any rumors on when Apple Pay Later is actually going to drop All I can see is that its supposed to come with iOS16 but I cant find it anywhere
Dynamic Touch ID Yes Dynamic Face ID no Look How you hold that phone and your Eye Look much More in the Face ID Cam
How bout they put in a defibrillator into the watch for people with heart issues Since the watch can detect heart rate What if the watch could send a shock in case the person have vfib attack
Farouttttt nice 800 ultra wash
Wait so apple only had 2 times zoom for ages then went to 3x zoom for the 13 pro now that they have added 2x zoom back again  its a feature
Good to know apple has crash detection now My Pixel has had it for a while 
I think it might be better if the dynamic island can display notifications as well like the notification just pops out from the pill instead of a separate box like the one shown in the video
Hey quick question not sure if you can answer this but do you think crash detection will go off on a rollercoaster ride
every time I wonder how they implement the ideas that were already in android  they do it better than the same samsung  xiaomi etc
I think the best camera system of 2022 is Samsung S22 Ultra 
MKBHD recorded videos resolution is so high that it feels like 4k on 480p
Can we admit now that apple treat their customers like idiots
Shoot with ProRaw during the night or very low light If you have a DSLR compare them Its freaking out run the DSLR now
How come they keep having the same Huge bezels year after year My PH1 has smaller side and top bezels than this
More android now Apple now makeclassic to Copy cat
Next year 8k and USB C better island and new design
Shouldnt dynamic island be easy to integrate into the software of most current phones
No one is copying this Most phones are gearing more towards under display camera module period
That watch tan was intense lol thanks for the video
Appreciate the shout out to the LG V10 I loved mine back in the day Rest in parts
I feel like ios16 is tanking my battery on my 13 pro
This video felt like a return to excellence like a love letter to what makes an MKBHD video great
Did you say chevron the oil people
So it will keep taking shitty moon photos
DI is dope
Great review Very informative as always The intros keep getting better and better Im loving it I also agree with the section of the video talking about who the phone is for Its really important to spend your money wisely on tech according to your needs I feel like this is a minor update that should be targeting a very specific demographic but apple being apple will manage to lure in more people who will upgrade for the sake of the logo on the back
I dont want my phone to use a dynamic island Its pointless for me
I can see Mr Beast doing a how long does the iPhone take to call for help after being stranded or a Car accident challenge
apple has been coping for years soo
Does reachability work with the pill
Still waiting for iPhone to include a 10x telephoto lens similar to Samsung It seems gimmiky but as a photographer this is my favorite lens to use as the results look professional and nothing like any other smartphone camera
2mill views in few hoursYeah I guess everyone was waiting for this to drop lol
No sim card standard is gonna kill the unlocked market and apple fanboys are gonna kickstart that
"Why did Apple stop with the S lines because this is clearly an iPhone 13S
Or maybe the 13 was a 12S
Idk just my thoughts"
Does 48MP mean better digital zooming resolution
they should copy the fuckin type c port
The dynamic island is just an excuse to not solve the notch problem It is not a solution to the notch
So iPhone 14 Pro added a Windows taskbar at the top of the phone Got it
I switched to Verizon nd they gave me 1000 In credit towards the new iPhone 14 pro after trading my iPhone 12 Pro Ive had for 2 years now
That separate glass thing is actually really nice
Bouncy Castle for crash test
Anyone know where to find the wallpaper he was using
1750 In 2 years they will have to put in USBC in EU atleast About time
If this had USB C this iPhone would have killlllllllllllllllld
God apple and iPhone are just disappointing overpriced trash
Petition for them to call the notches on devices static peninsulas
what about smudges on the front camera
"I have a few thoughts and questions  
1 Due to the lack of SIM card tray Apple is definitely going to sell an easy to set up data roaming plan to international travellers It will be hailed as a great innovation and implementation even though they have actually taken a feature and versatility away
2 Apples always on display is no better or worse than anything on Android other than maybe battery life
3 As someone who comes from a country that doesnt have a service like 911 how does the crash alarm work Does it dial 911 and play a recorded msg saying that iPhone user XYZ has had an accident to an operator and transmit GPS data Im assuming that there are several 911 hubs for different parts of the USA would the ones in smaller towns have the equipment to receive GPS data this way What if you are in the middle of nowhere without signal 
4 The Dynamic Island  This thing has just rubbed me the wrong way for some reason I posted about this on the preview video as well Im not usually one to diss Apple on the internet and so on but the amount of attention this feature is getting probably because this is the most lackluster and incremental phone upgrade yet is just ludicrous It is a waste of space compared to the extra screen space that a teardrop or hole punch screen which could instead be used to display actual content without some wobbly blob randomly floating around and distracting you All relevant notification based stuff is anyways a single click or swipe away as it is with this as well All  I hear is Apples implementation and Apples bestest animations without hearing how it is actually better than another system in comparison and what problem its actually solving The only thing its doing is distracting you and has just changed from wasted screen space to wasted screen space that moves around unnecessarily
Sorry for the rant folks but I am open discussing this in a civilized manner"
"no more notches 
hate them"
Cant wait for the iPhone 15
Same phone for last 4 years 
As always youve got the best smartphone review channel out there Great video Thanks Marques
48megapixel on a tiny sensor skeptical but I preordered a 14 pro max anyway
Bro I Justine killed it on the island features montage and I was expecting that level from you
"Dynamic Island looks cool but its not going to be so comfortable taking your thumb to the top of a huge display and you have to clean your smudges every next hour 
Btw iPhones do copy things but people dont talk about that Lol 
1Always on display
2And the same looking clock and wallpaper colour on the lock screen from pixel"
What about smudges on the front camera each time you click the dynamic island
Dynamic island  its a huge revolutionary technology  honestly apple find a people stupid  One third party app company easily make this 
For once i feel like they failed to do the always all display Even though its been out for years
Your sound is always amazing
As someone who travels to the carribean to visit family eSIM is something that might hold me back from upgrading
Coming from an iPhone 11 Pro Max can say if I dont get the new iPhone before the end of the year I wont upgrade but I think it will cause 120hz
I believe iPhone 15 will be the real deal solid upgrade with the regulations forcing Apple to adopt usbc but the 14 is beyond compelling the front aesthetic of the phone does a great job convincing the laymans  its worth the upgrade
Do you think itll be cable on taking 3 eSims
I love square screens compared to a curved one Samsung displays just feel better for me
"i turn off my always on display so idc about that feature but do you think its worth upgrading from 13 pro max to 14 pro max 

i personally dont see much of an upgrade"
1k burning a hole in your pocket
What do screen protectors look like now with the DYNAMIC ISLAND
I cant afford but still watching 
Having an IPhone 11 Pro Max theres nothing thats pushing me to get the iPhone 121314  Steve Jobs did a better job pushing the wow factor on getting the new phone on that note I will continue waiting
Coming from an se 2 which should I buy out of the two mainly for daily use YouTubesocial media FaceTime
Would so much like having your wallpaper 
petermckinnon says in his video Im not going to cover blah blah blah go watch Marques  for thatMarques says you want to know about the 48 megapixel editing go watch Mckinnon
Thank you spend days on YouTube telling people that the dynamic island is old tech that LG has on the v10 and v20 from 2015 and 2016 Thanks for helping getting the word out
Please Share wallpapers
So its a task bar Ive seen that
Dynamic island seemed great at first but it now seems to get in the way more than NOTCH
The esim part is making me want to get the iPhone 13 since I travel to small rural towns in foreign countries 
Gotta say as an Android use that wouldnt switch to an iPhone unless they got Tasker to run on it without being crippled I like the dynamic island thing Its pretty neat
The digital eSim in the 14 pro is available in Australia as well the carriers here are offering the phone in two options a traditional sim or the new eSim
Listening to J Cole
Awesome review like always Love from Germany
I have had the iPhone X for 5 years  this would be a nice upgrade
2142 iPhone with Samsung battery  
Well I think its time for me to ditch my Z flip 4 and get a iPhone 14 pro yea yea
Does the dynamic island look different while watching videos
Wow that subtle X2D 100c Jesus  Please review that in dope tech
I take my watch off for martial arts as the fall detection kept triggering 8 Im also only going to upgrade to a 13 because they dropped that beautiful green from the 14 range The only differences are the camera for what I do my current 12 camera is perfect so meh an extra GPU core and satellite connection which wont be available in New Zealand anyway So Ill just save a few hundred dollars The only reason Im upgrading at all is to age out the XR I gave my daughter when I upgraded to the 12 because I will give them my old 12
Does the screen dim in 20 seconds from the heat
Definitely dont acknowledge that Google Pixel phones already had the crash detection and this isnt new technology
How is dynamic Island any different than having tabs open in the background Its really not innovative
The dynamic island feature on these Pro iPhones certainly feels more interesting than just a simple hole punch on the display of many smartphones
Dynamic island is ugly made the notch more noticeable alwsys on display Id even worse
No nothing new like I predicted
Why are all these reviewers saying Satellite KAHNectivity
"Like for Dynamic island 
Comment for shitty Glyph interface "
Somehow I feel like dynamic island is a gimmick because of its placement It wouldve been great if its at the bottom of the screen reaching it with one hand is hard
"Prices in the US dont change
Prices outside rising each year
but
whyyy"
Accident indication seems gimmicky unless they are using that through carplay perhaps
1500 Andrew looking like hes possessed by Pennywise and stalking the dog
Couldve gave the 14 the pill hole with dynamic island m  since its New 
I dont think the dynamic island will be copied by Samsung at least The S22 only has a dot for the camera the Z fold 4 has a camera under the screen I think thats going to be copied
No SIM card holder is a real no go for me I even upgraded my 12 to a china only duel SIM holder
Fornite and mark ass brown lee Will Smith
Please start giveaway
Watching movies will be so sad with that cutout
All those things you rambled off are they ACTUALLY FACTORS in Crash detection
I wonder how much revenue Apple will lose in China by not skipping the number 14 in the model name
Dynamic island is not new  though however its iphone
"I wonder if the cameras protruding so much will interfere with wireless charging in applications like the new Teslas where it seems the gap will increase Anyone have hands on feedback yet

PS At 948 you see the phone start to charge in a Tesla but I still wonder if it affects charge rate having more of a gap now"
I might upgrade to 15 if it gets type C with dynamic island next year
Keeping my 13 they shouldve kept this junk
"Funny how reviewers criticized many oled screen smartphones but now that iphone does a terrible always on display that creates a big risk about BURN IN effect nodoby seems to notice that
This is pure disonesty"
That LG shout out was excellent
its not always a 48 MP camera though if it doesnt meet the conditions then it goes back to a 12
Is pro res still unavailable for 128G model
Im wondering about the crash detection on amusement park rides
"Theres never a single piece of lint in any of your videos its like he recorded this in a clean room 

The standard "
Not testing a few things that we want tested 
I wonder if the Dynamic Island allows voice assistants like Alexa to work passively in the background when the app has already been opened so that its possible to say voice commands from your iPhone without directly going into and opening the relevant app first
These upgrades were supposed to be on last years model
No it wont be copied
And still no USB C
Props to LG
Does this thing have USBC yet or are they still sticking with their same charger Ive heard rumors they are finally getting with the times on that front
Elon Musk and CEO from TMobile had a public even about eventually start using starling satellites to connect with customers that are in same situations like what Apple explained and also they say that our current phones do not need to be replaced nor you need to purchase or pay for that service But apples says they will give you for now 2 years of some service meanwhile eventually from SpaceX and TMobile is totally freeJust wanted to get a bit more info as why apple is gonna charge money for this when the system isnt even yet fully well done and yeah the same may go for Space X and team TMobile but is free Any ideas
"Love this guy for being so on point always
Thanks Marques"
So this is not the year one should go for the pro if they really truly the camera enthusiast as probably by next year Apple will be mature enough to bring the new features and then they will utilized the Apple 16 chip
That smart watch tanline tho
Wouldnt the always on be a burn in risk
I went from LG to Apple in 2021 still love my old LG V series phones
MKBHD I saw you have Bumble on your iPhone do you want to review my profile
The Dynamic Island is the best iPhone upgrade in recent history
Even the xs max got a huge makeover with just the software upgrade
i really hate the way the always on display shows the whole screen theres no need for it to show the background
"Bro the esim will hit international travellers big time for sure i know i will get a quick sim when i traveled 
Thanks for mentioning"
The notches arent even an issue I dont know why this even becomes a talking point Has never been in the way or a problem of any kind Doesnt look bad I cant say it wouldnt technically look better but its like its fine as is
The jump from the iPhone 12 Pro to 13 Pro was a lot bigger than this Dynamic Island just stole the show
"Still trying hard to get there
Extra motivation Marques

Well see someday"
Id like it if a swipe down from the home screen opened the notification screen seeing as we now have a search button on the Home Screen
LG experimented with like everything But they stopped because everybody bought other phones c
"To be honest 
Thats not Always On Display 
Its a dim screen"
If ever you feel useless remember that there are about 10 pixels above the dynamic island that serves no purpose at all Well done apple
Well photos youve provided at the end of the video are mostly terrbile
all i want is one thing let me put my apps on the bottom so fn dumb
That intro thooo
Someday the quality of a photo is going to be so good that I cant send it through Discord without Nitro
"Hate to be that guy but samsung tried the island thing with their first wave of front punch hole cameras and it was at best kinda met It is neat as an idea about as neat as a dad joke is funny
I always felt like this kind of software gimmick assumes that Im stupid an gullible enough to believe that this bug is actually an intended feature and all it does is make me hyperaware of the physical hole in my screen for a camera that I use maybe twice a year
It may be too late for this discussion now but I believe that bezelless screens are awesome But still not worth the punch hole camera"
"Who can help me with the link to an high quality wallpaper shown at 714

Reminds me my first iPhone the iPhone 4 "
Still not USB C Still wont consider getting one
I think the dynamic island is idiotic It just calls even more attention to the annoyingly large pill on the screen Its Apples desperate effort to spin a design flaw into a positive and it looks like a lot of folks are happy to drink the KoolAid
About the USBC as you have seen before apple likes to create their own connectors like the old iPhones had their Unique Port and then they upgraded to lightening ports so i think they are not gonna use USBC just like all the new phones on the market currently instead they will Invent something new that is equivalent to USBC but durable 
iphone 14 series still no fingure print scanner
No thank you for the Undynamic IslandApple can keep that Dynamic Notch for those that fall for the scheme End of the day its still a notch and even worse when you watch content in landscape Can you imagine getting messages and the island getting bigger as you are watching the game
24fps stans PSH MORE LIKE 23976
20ysl is SUCH A THROWBACK Loved the soundtrack today
One hand use of big screen smartphones is so much better recently in Android world eg with menus automatically pushed down Im afraid this dynamic Island thing will set a new trend of annoying topofthescreen widgets that cannot even be scrolled down
That satellite feature wouldve been nice in that movie Fall
The best camera system in any phone in 2022 Bruh I knew he was a shill for Apple but now just flat out LYING GTFOH No wonder this channels subscription numbers keep sinking like the Titanic Social Blade look it up
Anyone who is reading this i pray that whatever is hurting or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better May the darkest thoughts the overthinking the doubt Exit your mind right now May replace confusion May peace and calmness fill in your life 
I sincerely hope Android phones dont adopt this feature I dont want a dead space when watching videos in my phone
Dynamic island should have been at the bottom of the phone You should just have to rotate the phone around for selfies I know sounds stupid but would be awesome to have a multitask bar within a reach of a thumb
Im an android user and even I have to admit the dynamic island idea is genius
One way to test the car crash detection might be driving with it and dropping it out the window but Im not too sure The barometric pressure would be the last thing to get triggered Id assume
Wait for next year because next year iPhone will be available with TYPE  C cable with all these features and stuffjust a thing 
Six flags is going to get a lot of ambulance calls now  
im looking to buy an iphome should i get a 13 or a 14
My guy you wearing makeup Blend it in homes 
If this phone had USBC it would be an automatic upgrade for me But I will probably stick with the 12 Pro for another year and see what the I15 brings
Loved the Intro just a suggestion Marques maybe use blender animation with 3D modelnot that much work that would look more clean Looking attached handle to iPhone in intro was a bit odd
Lol iPhone 14 in India is almost 1000
nice review
Dont forget to clean camera everytime you want to take a selfie LOL
I think the island is dope wack name tho
Apples products are a work of art
Im using my 8 plus rn and finally I have made up my mind to buy a 14 pro I think it would be worth it thanks for the video
the only difference between Android and iOS is that Apple takes too much time to copy Android features while Android will just copy Apple after the release of new iOS 
Ive been wondering about the car crash detection on things such as a roller coaster setting it off with the immense Gs they can cause or other sudden stop start or fast rides
 your knee is hurt sorry to hear that man
Behind the scenes video on The Studio channel pls and thank you
Apple really want to keep its customers alive Pity food manufacturers dont take that idea onboard
I still think the dynamic island is horrendous I prefer the notch after years of me smack talking the notch
Meh nothing to be excited and run towards getting a new iPhone
1250 who else tried to wipe the finger print off 
"This item was canceled on z 14 2022 and you have not been billed for it
Yes you are right Thank you for saving me money "
Is prores feature on the 128gigs version as well
Yh I disagree the dynamic island is plain and simple gimmick nothing more
Android have that already like you can swipe the bar down the bottom of the screen if you have apps is the background it does switch between the apps
Is it not just a repurposed touchbar
The dynamic island would annoy me so much Imagine the finger prints over the camera on that thing And I use my front camera quite a bit
Apple shouldnt even talk about copying their phone as a whole is just copy paste
Ive already a got dynamic island clone  on my Android 
Solid phone like the iphone 11 was but not much has changed design wise At this point am hoping the iphone 15 can arouse some sense of cutting edge design and tech The last few years apple has really not impressed Just a few updates and not necessarily upgrades have been done to get more money from persons especially when they keep putting less in the boxes Hopefully that changes
Naaah Im straight on the 14 lol they tripping
Those camera bumps Big
Hi I have a question regarding the eSIM Im planning on buying the Iphone Pro 14 but using it in Argentina I dont know if I misunderstood but  will the phone work outside US or it will only work with US carriers Is there info on this
Im not sure you could copy that ridiculous Pill for a selfie camera
does anyone know what calendar widget that one on the lock screen is
I guess there would be a significant number of professionals working daily in remote areas that will look into this satellite feature and Watch Ultra very seriously
Id love to see a transitioning from Android to iOS video Im a long time Android user thats going to switch to the iPhone 14 Pro would be nice to have a comparison and guide to swap over
Most probably he is not dropping his iphone on a plain floor Insted dropping it on floor mat  
This is the exact same song you used for your iPhone X unboxing
Stay with 13 pro Doesnt care about the 14 I also still use the 8 because I love the Fingerprint unlock I hate Face ID doesnt work in bed
The way he said The Dynamic Island Baby Hahahaha  
Hey Marquees  is there a review video for Apple watch series 8 coming up 
Just gonna call it the DI or the pill tbh
singing in foreign language
Okay marques I NEED to know what kind of app u have for the calendar Lock Screen widget NOW Great video btw
Those who didnt care about the faceid would never understand the notch its totally necessary to have and is the best option I aint gonna buy a phone with a fingerprint scanner placed in a narrow power button i like the beach to verify me itself
JESUS CHRIST IS COMING SOON BELIEVE IN HIM JESUS CHRIST IS THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN llllll
Might actually upgrade my note 9 to this Imma keep waiting on other reviews first but looks good
How in the hell did you guys create this new intro  The intros are at an absolute different level to even some Movies at this point The amount of attention to details is unbelievable Just UNBELIEVABLY BEAUTIFUL
Bet the display is still stupidly easy to scratch with your jeans lint I miss the times when phone manufacturers cared about scratch proofing their displays more than shatter proofing
As soon as I saw that Dynamic Island thats exactly what I saidEveryone is gonna copy it I bet you Samsung is scrapping whatever they had planned for their new phone already lol
"Iphone 14 Pro Max is a master of none finally keeping up with the Lg v60 ThinQ released after iphone 11 Nice job apple NOT
And Mr Master of none you forgot to tell your audience than Apple is using LG CAMERAS FOR YEARS"
Cant buy that 
Watching this video video carefully bit fan fact i didnt even use any iPhone but always love this thing 
Now how many of you went to wordle and typed up Alpha
Lame gimmick My iPhone 13 Pro Max and the 14 are almost identical beside the camera quality but the battery and display is the same so whatever pointless phone to be honest
824 MKBHD keycap set when
Oh for sure This is getting copied in future
"I hate IPhone for all it is nothing changes Just more is taken away

Ill stay with My Samsung "
hit my iPhone X with iOS 16  its real good
How did you make your signal bars dots again And what was on your shortcuts in your Lock Screen
"Its hard to improve on greatness 
Say whatever you want but the iPhone 14 pro looks amazing and IS amazing You trying to belittle it because it isnt flashy and it isnt drastically different from the previous generations is just not respectable in my opinion Yeah I get it Youre not a huge fan That doesnt mean it isnt a great fing product 

The only problem I have with it is the huge price increase over last year In the US its always cheaper for some reason but over here in Europe its insanely expensive The 14 pro max 256gb is 1609 13 pro max 256gb was 1379 for reference "
These vendors will give out details not accurate to the task just to promote their products They claim a refresh rate down to 1hz on LTPO display but in actual usage its 10hz MKBD the lockscreen or AOD has a refresh rate of 10hz not the acclaimed 1hz I have a S22ULTRA which Samsung claims has a screen refresh rate as low as 1hz but I have a refresh rate monitor The minimum value the screen refresh rate can go is 10hz
went from an iphone x 2017 to iphone xs max 2018 bc my mom upgrades her phone to the 13 Ill wait for the iphone 15 lineup next year
The reason I like your channel is Unbiased Truth  Awesome product review with best info available
Hocus Pocus  
KING
samsung hq is burning rn and does everything to copy it
Born Sinner
Should I upgrade from my iPhone 12 Had it since it came out 0 issues
"Too bad it doesnt have usb c 
No usb c no buy"
Great video as always Hope your knee is alright saw the knee pt on your calendar widget
Nice dbrand flex casually dropping the iPhone 
Does he get his iPhone 14 pro earlier just because hes a famous tech guy I preordered mine and it wont get here til the 28th of September
The thing I find so odd is the praise the notch is getting just because apple designed notifications around its still a big useless notch and these are just pop up notifications Plus the redesign  probably means 2 or 3 more versions of the big notch till apple  invents underscreen cameras
Marques has a subtle way of marketing things I like it
Honestly I think apple is doing the right thing for taking so long to bring the pill and I think theyre doing the right thing by not immediately going to the niche products such as the folding phones But I think the pill does make it a better quality of life for some people Not a huge improvement just enough for people to notice a difference
Wow Check out the New Iphone It looks so good The innovation is crazy  Danm Apple take my wallet Wow 
return of the OG intro song that you accidentally blew up on spotify
this video has roll on ads  isnt this something marques said he wouldnt do
Upgrading from my 6s so this is very much welcomed The change from the home button touch ID 3D touch and headphone jack are gonna take some time
Great cinematography That intro was nuts
I like how you focus on the Pro only Im definitely inclined to it and hope to have it fr fr its now my dream
We need new MKBHD screen saver images to use with iOS 16
I cant wait to have promotion Going from 12 pro max to 14 pro and Ive been jealous of 90hz screens since the razerphone
Hey man I think we used to instant message each other back in the day on Google when you first got that going How do I reach you directly I may be able to help you  Im assuming your Twitter Thanks man
I must say my biggest problem its watching videos on iphone 14 with that big cutout  I watch lot of movies on my phone and to be honest I want to use all my screen 
iphone 14 pro max best phone of the world  
You can see the probe lens reflection in the intro  015
I am watching this on s22 ultra Instead of buying 14 pro will definitely go to tropical island
SHEEEESH THAT 125k DEPOSIT OK I SEE YOU
Mind sharing where you got that wallpaper
Better to have under screen camera island is a workaround for a ugly camera layout
I miss traditional top bezels with regular front facing cameras All this notchislandpillbox nonsense is really gimmicky IMO I like to watch alot of YT on my phone and the viewing experience is ruined by a group of essentially dead pixels on my screen Its lazy and a step backwards
This AO display is kinda garbo imo looks like when your phone is about to lock itself and it just drops the brightness before doing so I personally preffer the all black screen with important information highlighted
I have no idea why they cant just release all colors across the whole line but hey who am I just some schmuck
Apple please bring us a stylus SD card slot headphone jack super fast charging and ir blaster
would it be smart to use an iphone 13 pro case on a 14 pro considering the cameras protrude more
Dynamic island is so dumb Hahaha I hope it doesnt become a thing outside of the Apple ecosystem
Didnt mention about battery
That pill is so distracting hate the design
No 124hz Smh 
1821 SUPERFOOD 
Nobody is going to copy that stupid hamburger island I can change between apps more easily by pushing the recent button on the bottom
Pill notch Galaxy S10 plus had this too years ago
Ill pass on the 14 No SIM card slot
Saw a vid of someone using an external sim card adapter
Great news that the back glass is now separate from the rest of the components
Can you turn off the dynamic island
Its also the sound of a crash
MAJOR FAIL to put an oddball port from 2012 on a 2022 product rather than use standard USBC NO INTEREST until iPhones can use regular cables
Just need multi tasking and we are gucci
To test the crash detection put it in an RC car
Imagine that ugly notch was on an android phone   Youtebers will roast it
Should have been called Dnotch
So now you need to move your finger to the top to answer a call Yeah ergonomics
These apple sheeps will definitely be sold on this dynamic island When really its just another version of the notch
He was about to install another to do list app
I wanna see a Camera comparison between this phone and the Xiaomi 12S Ultra
Is that a Tesla surfboard
Kinda sad they took away the blue pro color that 13pro color was beautiful Wish they would go crazy and just gave us all of the colors up front silver black gold rose gold red green blue purple 
How much money is Apple paying Marcus and other reviewers for these GOOD PHONE REVIEWS  Iphone is a RIPOFF COPY CAT FRAUD
I dont care if people hate the dynamic island name it looks so useful I cant wait for my samsung to have the feature with the s24 lol
I dont think this dynamic island will be copied to a wide extentsince people have become used to punch hole display  with Samsungs invisible camera tech  Samsung galaxy Z fold 4  i dont think people will like it expect for the iphone itself
Please make GR corolla review on autofocus channel pls MKBHD
I wonder if Apple Watch your videos Also you said in your last video that you hope not to sayyou know lol 
 COPIED Pretty sure the punch whole is the way to go and if they do copy something it would be the under display camera Apple just doing Apple things selling old stuff they couldnt sell
Is that a Tesla surf board behind you
Iphone 13 pro case will not fit I think you said that it will but I may have misheard you
this has to be the intro of the year
We know it will be copied
Didnt we see this feature in the old LG V10
Its literally the same as my iPhone 12 Except they wrapped the screen around some of the notch wOw
I noticed you got yesterdays wordle in only 3 guesses bravo alpha took me all day to get
The dynamic island baby what a terrible name 
Seeing review of the most expensive iPhone from the screen of the cheapest low end android  inception
The only thing Far out in this phone is the dynamic island that cant be reached
I dont know why Im so triggered by the fact that MKBHDs broll and hero shots are all of phones with low battery warnings on   Goddamn man keep that phone charged above 20
1426 when you need to go to the bathroom while doing a review of the 14 pro
Im not going to get this iPhone My current one is fine But I liked the dynamic island from the start Really cool way to display notifications
I mean Dynamic Island looks cool but why put all those engineering works into that when they could just put it in the notification bar I would appreciate more if Apple puts investment into under display camera and face ID and perfect it that is when iPhone will get exciting again as in Steve era
Ehhh Nope its not going to be copied A widget banner maybe but no android user will want a hardware island that literally cuts your screen size
I mean this is a game changer for me because it means no notch PLUS more features I love animations so thats a plus but the one problem is all the fingerprints on the selfie camera from using the dynamic island Gonna be an issue
that notch still  looking silly
This intro is just bombastic
Ok but i should i upgrade from my iphone 8 to the 14 pro or will the 13 pro also do
Just wait nothing will match thr Tesla Phone Coming Soon 
I dont get whats silly about the name Dynamic Island
LG stole my idea for the lg g flex I submitted my design to an LG contest and they said not possible then a year or two later the g flex came out I even called mine the LG Flex
"Normie The new iPhone 14 has 48mp camera

Apple guy You mean the new 48 megapixels camera delivering 4x the resolution in ProRAW with 65 larger sensor than before and a breathe taking cinematic option"
Tesla board is soooo good
I dont think satellite is an edge case Cell towers will be a thing of the past in a year or two IMO With SpaceXs sat internet branching our more will follow I dont think it will be too long before all data is transmitted in this way
Boring safe phone that is not necessary to get 
I just saw you on Vinh Xo youtube channel at Apples iphone 14 launch event
1300 Does front camera get smudgy from using Dynamic island
Mkb likes everything blackbut when it comes to girls
Wow how innovative not Most phones will lose the notch while Apple is still trying to downsize theirs lol
Yo the guy was right about the dynamic Island turning into iPhone In the intro 
I always keep my phone in the cup holder while driving so whenever I got notifications I use to get a preview of what it is but now with the new iOS I cannot see those cos they moved the notifications tab to the bottom I hate that thing
"love that intro song
Allttaa 20syl  Mr J Medeiros  Disarm"
That intro was amazingly put together I can see the reflection of the LEDs of the Probe lens 
Thanks to mark LG got the credit they deserve Apple stealing ideas from AFK company 
Youtubers acting surprised at the apple event like its the first they are seeing it 
I dont know if apple keeps track of all services that uses battery life but I would assume that it should have something labeled screen idle within the list to see how much battery it does use But I digress
"I was thinking of upgrading my iPhone 11 Pro Max but I think Im going to wait for a USBC port 
I do love the dynamic island  no matter how silly the name is  and that purple "
"you got my like for this time 
you win"
Give us a Tesla surfboard review
How many people really need to buy this
This is just another New phone Its spy on you 247
Two times when I thought you played some Bad bunny song when you mentioned the Dynamic Island 
I am very disappointed that they got rid of Sierra Blue That automatically makes it a no go for me I have the 13 Pro Max and am going to wait until the 15 with fingers crossed Either way there arent enough new upgrades on the 14 to upgrade
Intro is legit Good job
I want that wallpaper please hit me up with it in good quality
No it wont
HE WAS LISTENING TO KANYE 523
Bro apple should just ask him to make intros for them
Please stop wasting your money Keep your current iPhone for another year and dont buy any of the iPhone 14 range A total rip off for people with more money than sense
Did he just tell us and apple he broke the NDA
The dynamic notch
The Dynamic Island reduces the area for movie watching though
"I honestly always get the oh are you working out on the Apple Watch when I flog the dong which is crazy since my watch in my left wrist and not the right 

Just think about the force youre giving of Hats off to Apple "
Lol you know you wouldve done that intro with the lowercase i rather than the capital i had they gone with that design Oh well
Just Marketing to hide that they are not able to solve the problem with the notch Already had the notch for almost 4 years and now they put it a little bit further down and put some software Around it and voila Design set for the next 4 years but a little bit more expensive than before
wow pro 14
Im skipping the upgrade and instead getting myself the Secret Lab Magnus Pro XL standing desk to improve my WFH life
The dynamic island is something that a lot of people will make full use of because usually you use one hand to use your phone and since its at the top itll be difficult to reach it with just one hand I dont know just my thought though
Years from now a new revolution comes A notchlessislandlessholepunchless phone Its the joke of this century ROG Phone ftw
US pricing might have stayed the same but European pricing has shot through the roof Sheesh
1k phone and talking about AOD animations like its a thing crazy times
E sim ahh yes so the gov has an easier way to track you as well
000014 the seagulls 
Bruh answer your gmail  2800 notifications lol 
It costs 1400 or 1400 right now its 11 lol in Germany 
iPhone 14 Pro Max should arrive to me Friday Super excited as my previous phone is an iPhone XS Max
Did you notice any pwm flicker on iphone 14 pro screen
Which widget is that calendar shown at 141
Xiaomi will always copy Apple and sometimes others But I think island will make fun at the beginning and then become boring Like all the nice wallpapers cutout around Samsungs punch hole
I hope they dont turn a little hole on your screen into an entire island
This feels like the first non dbrand sponsored video or maybe i just havent watched in a while
Not thrilled about esim i moved across the country and am on my parents plan still i want to keep my number and dont have admin on the account i have moved my current sim between like 7 phones what do i do now
My iPhone 12 Pro Max called the police when I got in a wreck in November
The name Dynamic Island is starting to grow on me 
Spoiler Alert for Wordle players who play a little late 1243 TS
How did He do the calendar Widget on the thumbnail
Intro was amazing but what was up with that metal stick on the right Usually they remove things like that
so this is basically an Android phone now
If the US versions lack a sim tray does the 14 Pro in Europe still have it Or is it all Pros lacking it
Only a few people know that this is the same song 0000 he used for the iPhone X unboxing
The dynamic island wow what bunch of Baloney
"The pro has a horrendous cut out I would prefer the notch over island
The iPhone is a disappointment for me No USBC notch is worse no telescopic camera no 8K video And the always on display is useless"
I have been waiting for u to get back to the studio 
You know the video is going to be sick when most people would mistake the opening shots for a apple commercial
New iPhone isnt worth it at all in my opinion Its literally just updates on womens health being able to get help when you have 0 signal and more records for police when you get into a car accident 
intro track disarm by AllttA
Switching from an 11 pro max to a 14 pro max is it worth it
That Dynamic Island is like Samsungs AntiOneUI Kinda need to twohanded your phone to interact with that island unless you gotta decent size hands
Is the haptic feedback bugged I updated and I dont get any feedback when using the keyboard in apps like iMessage Safari Search etc
"MKBHD what would you call this dynamic island do you consider it as a feature or a marketing gimmick
Let me know your thoughts"
Apple doesnt do things first but they do it right
I wish theyd include a way to test the satellite feature so you can get accustomed to it before you need it Seems like something you wouldnt want to have to figure out in a 127 hours scenario
Why is no one showing how the dynamic island protrudes in widescreen YouTube videos Ive seen most of the reviews and first impressions of YouTubers and no one is talking about it Did Apple forbid you
Where to find that wallpaper Share that one from the beginning please Thanks in advance Nice review
Someone knows where to get this blurred wallpaper Thx a lot 
Regarding the battery performance you mentioned I think also the haptic keyboard contributes its part
For satellite SOS they should keep 5 battery always as reserve Reducing 5 battery capacity but itll be so worth when you need help
Said connecting AirPods twice 
i miss LG
I have the Samsung S22 Ultra I am using the Samsung message app to send text messages When I send a text message to someone I get the visual notification Delivered under the text message to let me know the message was delivered But at the same time I also get an audio sound WITH the visual notification to let me know the text was sent I get the sound that is the default sound that is under the sounds and vibration under the notification sound I do NOT want to get an audio sound after I send the text message I only want to see the visual notification Delivered to let me know the message was delivered How do I stop the audio sound when I send text messages I also disabled the option hear outgoing message sounds under the general settings
Itll be pretty hard to expand eSIM As many providers in other countries doesnt support eSIM yet
How do you switch it off when watching a video or playing games
Also can we get a link to your spotify playlist
Very honest review Thank you 
i dont like them pushing no sim card tray im eu so for now im good i know seen the eu is makeing them go to type C anyways maybe the eu will stop them with the sim card as well
Why you so bothered about testing car crash detection if you werent this pressed about testing it on pixels
As a pixel user thats had crash detection for a while it does not accidentally trigger dropping your phone
Sticking to my 12 on ios 16 and saving up for 15 pro
That intro was slick Definitely worth the hours of time spent making it 
Lmao Apple is good at one thing marketing Nobody copies their tech because its never new tech Oh man you can have widgets on your screen now Thats cool I see they still cant seem to engineer that notch out of existence either Maybe if their business model wasnt sucking every last penny out of consumers with multiple versions of the same devices year after year theyd be able to actually create something worth buying
What widget is that  looks like a calendar
Android HW Devs take the throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks method when it comes to their innovation Apple is the kid just watching what sticks and then implementing them all slowly
And at night  with the brighter display
Are we just gonna ignore how clean that intro was
its pretty much just the iphone 13 pro with a dynamicv island if ur upgrading to this from the 13 or the 12 you ar just wasting money apple like every other phone maker has run out of weays to really improve smartphones so techtubers just spend 20 mins talking about dumn bs that dosent really matter
Go and use samsung do not give bad reviews for iphone 
Battery percentage
"Chevron hoodie
Looks like a Petro Canada hoodie 
Love from Vancouver"
Sooooo whats up with the battery iPhone 13 or 14 better
The dynamic island finally explains where the Touch Bar team were reassigned to
Can it export iMovie project in background
I prefer to call it the Pro Pill
LG wasis an OG
dropping the plugiphone drop in the dbrand case I get it lol
In that first scene I couldnt tell which was the 13 and which was the 14 bc they werent flipped over
Dynamic Island boy 
Theres nothing new about it
That backround on the phone tho
I saw that the reflection of the probe lens on the phone screen in the intro hahahaha I deal with that a lot in Watches Ads
So I have a normal 13 I settled for it because I needed a phone bad at the time for work originally I wanted the sierra blue 13 pro max should I make the upgrade
I dont even need a new phone I just think tech is cool and enjoy the production quality of your videos lol
140 how do I get this wallpaper though Looks awesome
Answering calls from the notch is  uncomfortable for many people Dropping your 14 pro or pro max will increase because your thumb is trying to interact with notification from all the way top Each time you touch the notch the glass will catch your finger print  will give you a blurry selfie
Witch is good I am not smort
That island is the indicatoru either have it or u dont
"Like bro send me a iPhone


Just saying "
"Most detailed and most honest review ever 

Luv from India "
Ohh yay it can see everything I do
Poor CGI at start  pff be better 
"Why will anyone copy the dynamic island Its bollocks 

What phones WILL do is a decent under display selfie cam and no notch pill or hole"
Of course it will be copied  once a new pill comes on the scene everybody wants one
Funny in previous video he said Apple will be move to flexible screen if it gain popularity but when apple does a simple UI thing its said others will copy it He seems every day more and more biased
What wallpaper is this Loving that look
Wheres is your fold 4 review
Despite the Dynamic Island is pretty cool Id still take a little forehead and no notch
Did Andrew get the clamp right
no just me  hahahah
Seems like nothing new really Also great to know that a company that charges so much for innovation uses 10 year old tech meanwhile Samsung are killing iPhone I think Ill think twice about this iPhone 14 upgrade
J Cole and Kanye west make your phone look amazing  great job man
Love the review Just one question though with regards to the always on display at 814 I could see that No Cellular Connectivity is taking a hit on your battery Could that be the reason why the phones battery is draining fast  since the phone is always trying to get coverage and poor reception could cause unusual battery drain
Heres my curious question With a 48MP shooter do the pictures become much larger files Does that mean the 256GB storage space might be insufficient and 512GB would be a better choice
I think no one can beat their cameras every single year
Reaching the dynamic island sucks one handed 
RIP LG phones 
But why tf aint there an iPhone with 16 gna ram Samsung is ahead of da game
Finally will be upgrading from the 8 Plus Cannot wait 
can u provide link to your wallpaper
More people should put some respect on LGs name because of their unique contributions to smartphones
This is the phone to skip 
The production quality of your content is insane That intro was amazing
You guys are getting new iPhones 
Nice intro 
"I feel like Apples killing under display cameras with this dynamic island in a similar way to how they killed the headphone jack

Get rid of a feature that was an overall better implementation so they can charge extra for their solution to a problem they created 
I really hope the industry doesnt follow this and stop developing under display or even pop up selfie cameras altogether"
too big all the phones are too big My next phone will still be a 13mini and if theres nothing smaller than 61 when that phone is done that will be a sad sad day and i may well get another 13mini
One problem with dynamic Island I can see people complaining in the future is that constantly touching it to open apps will leave finger marks on the camera lens which will ofcourse effect the selfie quality
"Honestly I wish that I had the option to turn on those pixels in between the 2 holes Still keeping the dynamic island but when not in use turn those pixels on 
I just think it would look better maybe I am wrong but I would like to see it"
They have way too much cash for what they are and their marketing is unbelievable Its so good  the difference between their website and Samsungs website is laughable
I love Samsung soo much The only thing that will hurt Samsung is be like Apple
At 2045 you spoke directly to me I refuse to upgrade from my iPhone 11 lmao
This is totally off topic not sure if you have but can you please review the Artifox desk I saw that you have one in this video
The dynamic island thing aside from the stupid name is just a slightly fancier notificationstatus bar It didnt need to be pill shaped for this it couldve stayed a notch which looks way better imo because now theres a bit of screen above the pill thats basically useless Its just a fancy way to try and make something ugly look better It doesnt get rid of the actual problem which is a hole in the display
That intro short was amazing Youve managed to highlight the major update in it so effortlessly Kudos Cant wait to see the BTS on the Studio Channel
I was hoping he would share just how long that phone can sustane 2000 nits iphones get hot while facing sun
Fingerprint smudges on the Dynamic island 
Is your mom enjoying the boat 
sooo u broke the NDA and made a video admitting it at the beginning lmao
I hope you killed that spotted lanternfly
Dynamic Island seagulls 
Apple should just make a full camera
Notch will be copied
Samsung laughing at apple made that island 3 years ago
Crash function great for motorbike riders on long rides out alone
No physical sim NOPE What is this Verizon circa 2007 Great way to get carrier locked
Common people cant afford apple products The day they start affording it apple will lose its value
I hope the screen is better on the 14 pro max because its trash compared to Samsung s
I honestly dont think this will get copied most high end androids phone have abandoned the notch all together and are using hole punch which is now being slowly phased for the in display camera as it gets better and better
Bro for 1000 bucks this phone sets itself apart with the software and chip integration
So its becoming an android nicee
Hungarian road quality will sure acrtivate Crash Detection a lot lmao
1812 love the tan line lol
It baffles me extremely that the always on display isnt on older models with oled that a feature even a cheap android phone can have isnt on a previous flagship apple phone is beyond ridiculous As if it got so outdated that it cant be done lol
im so used to the phone i have that an iphone 14 with ios 16 might be hard to get used to
"Dang it That camera bump is ridiculous I was hoping it wasnt so bad 
By the time you put a case that has raised edges to protect both the screen and cameras form scratches on your phone it looks like a brick"
After hearing Dynamic Island   Am a Island boyam a islandboy
This island thing is so bizarre on my cheap phone here I can use just my thumb to change music look at timers and switch between apps I dont need my screen taken up with info Its an apple solution to an apple issue other phones just have simpler ways of doing things but because its Apple people lose their minds Zero pre order gift I see again
I think there is no need to copy Dynamic Island as most android phones come with punch hole camera and is already used for battery status and front cam notifications And also there is no need to hide the massive pill cut out It can be copied as an UI element but not interactive element
DEFINITELY GETTING A HOODIE
Marques appears arrogant to me whenever he is talking about Apple products However its funny seeing comments mostly talking about Dynamic Island even though it is not a reason to get the 14 as mentioned by M
What happens when they can do the camera and Face ID fully under the glass I hope they keep that central top area for widgets because thats so useful to have when in any app to see sports scores timers music controls when your food is arriving etc
All they do is attempt to trap you into their eco system
I like the name dynamic island ahhh
1402 I see you Marques
Can you speak to eSIM and travelling abroad I visit Cape Town South Africa from the USA and need to get cell service there
Whats with the Times New Roman list
Camera looks great iphone 14  hardware level improvements really value for bucks
"Nice hoodie
Apple buys screens from Samsung Why cant Samsung buy Apples chips"
You lost me at LG V10 Closed this video and now navigating to your LG V10 review Nostalgia
Why is the icons not round I the island
am I the only one who noticed that theyve copied Samsung in a few bits like the lock screen saver thingy
the Dynamic island is nifty for centralising ALL the popups but getting the Max I likely wont appreciate reaching that far to the top of the screen its still a two handed affair which is counterintuitive its a stepping stone to removing the notch altogether anyway so its a stupid selling point the subpixel anti aliasing is nifty and typical apple and their AOD is just a dimmed lock screen its bad psychology lol Ill feel like Im waiting for lock screen to go black but never does its lazy make a dedicated UX for the AOD
The seagulls in the background when Dynamic Island was mentioned is just beautiful
What could also be efficient is that it turns off once you place the phone faced down on a tabledesk The always on display if we truly been honest this feature is not necessary but hey Apple has to stay up to speed with the rest of the competition 
Pretty much having a lightning port puts me off and Ill wait for the s23
crazy intro
So apple is preparing people for the nuclear holocaust How charitable of them
Can you turn the island off
For a guy like me that takes off swiping animations on his iPhone 12 mini I doubt I would even have use for an island looks nice though
What about smudges  constant interaction with dynamic island and the front camera
I think the intro is boring
Dont forget to floss Marques
"Im on 11 pro but i feel like it would be a great upgrade to me personally

Mainly because the battery now dies a little fasterhave to charge at around 6pm 910pm before

And ios 15 kinda slowed things down"
After seeing this Im so happy I got a Fold 4 Jesus its amazing how they literally made it uglier 
Maybe well get the 8k vids in two years from Apple
1000  tax right
bro my ad for this vid was triple a rick rolling me
16gb of Ram is pointless if you cant multi tasking window like other android phone
I think they could improve the focuse mode even more now u can switch ur lock screen to ur modes but how about ur modes go active with certain dates in your calendar for example you have class from 91030 your devices go mute currently my ipad doesnt which es really anoying when getting calls during class or important meetings
I think it is funny that there was a lot of shitting on apple for not having always on display they put it in and MKBHD is like imma pass 
said connecting airpods twice
1704 holy shit that difference is actually huge Theres just so much fine detail thats completely lost in the 12MP version Its just such a shame that the telephoto lens didnt also get a bump With a telephoto lens with that kind of quality we could really have a proper discussion about replacing larger DSLRs for actual photoshoots but Apple continues to gimp their products so they can sell you the next one
I updated from my 11 to thirteen pro like a few days ago cause it was cheaper and I dont feel like Im missing out on much
They should move th island and the time to the bottom and move everything up Now I must reach up to swipe down to see touch notifications at the bottom The URL at the bottom is working and atb the moment there is a bug gap anyway at the bottom for the island battery and time Just open your keyboard and chrck
One of the best intros on the channel cant wait to see some behindthescenes on the Studio channel
At time 908 in the video where the battery percentage and the color of the battery are showing is that exclusive to the new phones
Can you adjust the brightness of the always on display
Boring
Test the crash detection on a roller coaster
Dynamic island seems clever But its all the way at the top and phones are getting too big Hard to reach without using other hand
But I dont really care about any of that to be honest Me too byeeee
You could remove the dust in the beginning
Link to the wallpaper pls
production is kinda lacking on this video for one of the biggest video of the year on this channel
The oldest songs from MKBHD VIDEOS Spotify playlist are the best Major vibes
As an Android fanboy this is the first IPhone that apeals to me
dim always display 
Great if you drop the phone and someone stole it more useful set it up to call the police  oh and long gone where in horror movies people search for connectivity it will now look cringe 
Can we watch videos at 2K now  Or is it still 1080 P
now that you say it inyour take they will push buggy updates or cripple the older phones man why you do that
You didnt talk about the battery life or speakers or the phone vibration
the main question is what if they get rid of notchisland in like 2 years will there still be a useless bubble in the middle of the screen that just doesnt house a camera anymore
I thought Cinematic Mode was always 30 fps Like I thought people complained when it came out that it didnt shoot in 24
That introduction amazing awesome job
will the iphone 14 review be a shorts 
Is it just me or is the video noticeably less sharp than normal Like the intro had so much compression artifacts I had to check if I was watching in 4K Maybe YouTube throttling again
I would really like to see Apple implement a beefier cooling solution on their phones  Even when I have my iPhone 13 Pro out in direct sunlight the brighter screen will dim to cool down which isnt helpful   Dont even need to talk about playing games    I would love to see some beefier heat pipes in the back of these phones in order to keep them cooler for longer
that intro tho holy
the satellite stuff is made for Germany cuz there is no mobile data 2 meters away from a big city
Garmin cycle computers have had crash detection Which fortunately I havent had to use Just need this in the apple watch
"The specs bump will probably not be obvious to last year  
I bet people will be more enthusiastic in bed to try to cause a collision alert"
1523 Jesus it should be illegal to use this kind of nd filter in front of a red
Wallpaper in the thumbnail anywhere to download
I guess you will have to request a software update that flips the screen when you use the phone upside down
One thing I would also like to know is when youre watching a video like your videos and 21189 does the pill shaped cut into content or what does it look like for example if you watch Charlie Puth song light switch and you go to the video does it cut into the 21189 display that Charlie Puth shoots in for the light switch video on YouTube does the dynamic island cut into that video Just curious
Is size the only main difference between the pro and pro max
can we get a video on astrophotography please
"DAMN I
 want a 1000 hole is my pocket burning away 

Great video as always MKBHD"
trust in god for he is with you repent and you shall be saved
Am looking forward to you shaving you hair 
No issues here conceptually with the DI I think its a good solution that found an excellent problem to be paired with
you better have some battery percentage left when you try connect to that satellite
you just snitched on yourself on the NDA
1450 in Deutschland 
The euro prices Greed and the love of money We all get what we deserve
I absolutely hate is still has a lightning port
You just broke NDA at 1804 
Your reviews used to be more intense
"What a bunch of bullsht
Apple is at it again
 slightly better processor
 slightly better camera yep it was OK now it is OKer nothing groundbreaking
 youll definitely will notice difference if youre in a car crash or stuck in the Lost series thanks for that
 Dynamic Island is a huge scam instead of making the notch less visible theyve decided to put some beautification and usefulness in it which looks pathetic while others use in screen fingerprint reader and under display cameras Its like saying that prosthetic leg is better than real one because you can insert cap holder in it"
Im just going to call it the Pill Popup
Thats the point everyone is talking about always on display but now you have it and turn it off I will turn it off too because its not useful The past years I didnt missed it and now I didnt need it If it would be that important apple would have brought the always on feature way earlier
LG was an extremely innovative company when it came to phones trying new things all the time and having other phones adopt what it has done proves that sad that they no longer make phones
un hueco es un hueco y nada mas
"Im surprised the always on display isnt better Itd be nice to have different levels with how much is shown Like level 1 is 
just the time level 2 has more info level 3 is what we got"
More like the Dynamic front camera  finger print magnet
I think at this point we can pretty much say 8K USBCThunderbolt 2TB iPhone 15 Pro is a safe bet
Same device so many gimmicks and people eat it up  Holy shit this world truly is fucked
It annoys me so much how Marquez pronounces Connectivity Why
So should I upgrade from 13 pro or naa
Apple is no more gamechanger just same every year with minor upgrades 
Hard to reach on the V10 but now its great Come on
"You think say Samsung obviously not this year will go from that single dot to this dynamic island Similar with other companies
Funny if they all do as Apple transitions into cameras under the screen lol"
What you mean it will be copied It is the biggest phone copy yet
Honestly it would have been epic if you tested the crash detection and satellite connectivity in your own MKBHD style
When Im filing my nails my watch thinks Im doing a cross trainer workout Weird
Im sure this esim scrap is going to affect iPhone 14 market  worldwide in different countriesjust like in Africa80 percent of their presidents dont even know what an esim ishow it works iPhone is continuously giving people clear reasons not to use their products
050 
My question is can you just use the dynamic island just for messages like from iMessage and for calls and stuff like that but turn off of the features that you dont want that dynamic island to work with only turn off certain apps or all of the apps or whatever apps you want that would be cool I would love to know please and thank you
Hey will the Find My work through Satellites when you are on a plane
"I think the removal of the physical SIM card eSIM only option is very shortsighted 

For individuals who travel a lot being able to quickly buy and pop in a new SIM in each country is far more efficient than the hassle of having to set up a new plan under your name and credit card etc"
me who dont give a damn about the new dynamic shitand waiting to see iphone 14 mini featureselse going to pixel
mark ass browniee
Xiaomi f22 pro
Is there an option in settings to turn off the always on display 
Get the 13 pro max while stock lasts
I really dont know why But everyones saying dynamic Island is a brilliant feature Just think of Samsung or any other company would do the same Will you be okay with it Not going to bash them for this stupid long cutout thats blocking the view of the whole screen How about watching YouTube on this screen I am really curious to know peoples thought on this
I guess thats a new Tesla Surfboard you got there
That ProRAW was impressive
"How I wish I had some money for this iphone 14 pro max
I have used this techno phone for the last 15yrs 
And I wish I had a MacBook Am a BIG fan of apple cos of Marques but cant afford I will study hard to get a programming job to to get enough money by the end of next year"
Sick into
Youll have to be cleaning your selfie camera more if ur poking it all the time
Is it worth upgrading from 11pro to 14pro
"Android doesnt have notch but a teardrop or a round cut out

We introduce the Dynamic Planet"
Your review of the new iPhone 14 is by far the best review I have listened to You covered so much and made it easy to understand  A funny comment overexpose people with dark skin I would know   Great review  Thank you
I guess the phone cannot differentiate between a crash and a drop So a drop test would be the same as a crash test
Finally the hoodie is available Been waiting a while
I laughed out loud at the seagulls sound effect
please whats the wallpaper you are using 
Does someone think that MKBHD is neutral
Dropped some dumbbells at the gym and my watch thought I was in a car crash 
i can buy your hoodie on Amazon lmao no effort man
What an intro 
Until I see drama upgrade I dont think its necessary to upgrade your phone so frequently anymore My iPhone 12 still can basically last all day The speed may be slower but not unusable like it use too be
In India the prices are ridiculous 14 Pro128 GB stats at 129990 almost 1635 and 14 Pro Max256 GB stats at 149990 almost 1890
I guess interacting with dynamic island would let so many fingerprints on the selfie camera Im waiting for more reviews to see hows that
waiting android phone to copy that dynamic island
Can see a ton of iPhone photos fucking up with broke cracked cameras
yoooo
Your transitions are becoming better than Apple 
hes got a apple watch tan line 
Love the music clips
Sup besides this being the second coming of Jesus Christ What about the 60 frame rate
So they took LG and Samsung and combined the two sounds about right I guess its true what they say no idea under the sun is new
Honestly I have an iphone 13 pro and there is nothing interesting that much that will make me upgrade to the 14 pro For the most people they gonna use the  dynamic island for a few days then forget about it This phone not that wow to upgrade Probably iphone 16 or 17 or maybe 15 then well see
Speaking of crash detection My Apple Watch Gen 5 did trigger when I fell while playing with my oldest on the playground It did nothing when I had bike accident in which I broke my arm 
How cool would it be if while in ambient mode for ipod air pro or xf1000xm4 there was an option to amplify voice volume
Island Boy Im a island boy
Always on display are basically useless
This might be one of the most unexciting reviews I have ever seen This lackluster review single handedly killed all the hype I had for this phone Also can you actually provide a thoughtful reason for why the dynamic island is a bad name Waiting
Im keeping 13 pro nothing major with 14 pro so pass for me
1322  
So everything was a software update 
Shill
Whats the lock screen widget that you have
Damn YouTube compression did not do that intro justice
The satellite is huge Thats gonna get copied I mean starlink could do something like that
Im looking at switching to an iPhone form an s22 ultra is it worth going with the 14 pro max or going with the 13 pro max
Its such a better approach than just calling it a hole punch It became a feature instead of a limitation
fun fact Marques is the ONLY human you can pause video on who looks dapper AF no matter what expression he has midfreeze
Every single phone manufacturer that makes phones intended for Android will copy Dynamic Island Its a game changer
Im gonna wait for the iPhone 17 to come out then I might buy that one till then Im gonna stick to my iPhone 13 promax
I noticed that nobody talked about that the emergency sataliete feature is only available for the first 2 years for free
I wanna see the phone in landscape mode playing videos of different aspect ratios just to see how much content the pill cuts
In other words same rock solid performance the 13 would give with a few software upgrades and measly camera upgrade Nice thanks Marques 
Best intro ever
dynamic Island is just nothing phones back panel It looks ok but nothing much useful
I bounce back and forth between apple and Samsung every 3 years or so because I like both brands and what they have to offer Ive been with the iPhone most recently since the iPhone 11 After seeing this I decided to switch back to Samsung to give the Fold 4 a go Id basically be paying 1200 to change my notch to a pill While I do appreciate the upgrades offered in the 14 it feels pretty stale and unconvincing as a worthwhile upgrade beyond the hype for a new model fed by consumerism So might as well see what having a folding phone is like for a while
Marques your perceived stamina of the battery compared to your iphone 13 Pro does not come from the always on feature but from the higher nits of the screen imo
That iPhone 14 pro animation at the beginning was super cool
Thank you MKB doing the best tech videos around teaching and reviewing with an impartial view 
ive been on a samsung galaxy 10e and im thinking of switching to a iphone 13 when is the best time to buy one you think or is there maybe something else i should i buy i went to the retail store and i was suprised how well the iphone selfie camera looked
No 14 mini this year
Low key the love for 20syl Hocus Pocus and C2C is real in this channel haha Love it
You said its not easy to international travel Its impossible to chage the sim You simply dont have the option
1140 Team 69 Battery Linus would be proud
Lets give some time on Apple to improve more iOS 16 and customizations on always on display You can already  customise some  by using launchify app and shortcut apps on always on display  
can i have a free iphone 14pro
Honestly the intro and transition that this channel has reached is like the Apple one Wow Congratulation
Apple is the only idiots that cant get rid of the notch PATHETIC
Funny how you can make people love a huge hole in the display thats a screentobody ratio nightmare with terrible reachability by just putting some pleasing bubbly animations on it
Wonder how long it will take until someone figures out a way to unlock the gap of black pixels in the DI
Omg that intro was unbelievable Two thumbs up 
050 bro just confessed that he broke nda
It wont be copied its awful
Just love the pro version
Samsung for the win rip bozo apple
"Yeah Iphone 13
wait 14 sorry my mistake"
By naming tge the event FAR OUT they seem to mean their new watch introduced this year
If Samsung wouldve done it MKBHD wouldve called it an gimmick but since its Apple its revolutionary to him
Lock at this GRAAAAAAAAAPH
The wallpaper tho
Crisp
Imma need a video on the bts of that initial shot because THAT was sick
AllttA
Noticed the knee PT reminder on your phone Hope all is well
this is bad review for apple  What they thing some small upgrades and people would buy it or they made this on purpose with inflations and all that stuff They know that iPhone wouldnt sell that well
Was considering switching to IOS from Android but the cost in the UK is rediculous So it looks like its the pixel 7 pro for me just hoping they dont ramp the price up this year as I reckon in Europe people wont be sticking to the iPhone
Some ppl already complaining for oversharpening on twitter
USD 1635 here in India for the base pro 
Dynamic island jajajajaja Apple is so special
Wasnt Cinematic mode always 30fps Now they added 24fps with the 14Pro
wait this isnt an apple commercial
0845 who was laughing at the back stage 
Wont the dynamic island mess up the quality of the images from selfie cam by accumulating fingerprint smudges on the glass Are the manufacturers of the screen protectors considering this in their designs Just a thought 
"040 But you go on to basically admit that you displayed it publicly
207 Those numbers look a bit messy
859 So is the bit in the middle actual screen but it will never be used as in the pixels will never turn on 1142 Nevermind 
942 1000 How does that work then
1134 Is that the wrong list
1251 Cant they add the layer which registers touch on top of the sensors  camera if its transparent so you can tap directly on the nonscreen portion but the phone knows you want to access the dynamic island
1322 Damn
1403 Nice reference also Apple would never put out a graph like that where the scale makes the line look so low
1817 Those eyes seem familiar Maybe from some dog meme
2117 You already mentioned that point"
Im gonna get the 14 pro Coming from the XS Its that time
What if your on a rollercoaster Will it detect a crash
I seriously cant tolerate your ignorance towards Apples boring non innovative phones yet selling selling at ridiculous prices Seriously are you an Apple fan or a Tech fan at this point
I prefer my Iphone 11s static peninsular
Always on display looks like when i set my focus mode
I feel like its fine if its copied after all apple usually copies everyone else LOL
Dynamic island is a nice little feature but I kind of wish it was at the bottom of the screen instead of the top Is that just me
Am I the only one who is watching the intro for several times 
Props to whoever did that intro 
"314 i love how you dropped older iPhone thinking noone will notice because they look the same
For aways on display why on android ita good because it drains no battery its only a few pixels to litwhere on iphone not only ar night it will burn your eyes  but will drain your battery so it seems kind of useless I mean apple want to do it own way shouldnt they improve feature instead downgrading it
2the noch i doubt it will be copied on android so much well we see at some extent might be but its quite gimmicky and on androids we have only single camera cut out which is smaller than on iphone and yeat we are moving towards underdisplay cameras"
That camera and sensor holenotch is still something thats standing on display and iritating normal screen view  Its just packed differently You can packed all that stuff in body over display but  nooooo you must put fu dark spot or what ever on  screeeeeen
I have preordered an iPhone 14 but will have to still wait some for it to arrive I was worried about the always on display Thank you for introducing the toggle switch option to turn it off and on
I wanna take it down on a bobsled or skeleton sled We hit high speeds and lots of g forces so maybe thatll accidentally trigger the car crash response
SOLID VIDEO MARQUES IPHONE 14 PRO is KING of PHONES
I love reading the debates people have about phones in the comments lolsome people get so sensitive
Only good thing about apple this year is ios16  i just love ios16
Test using car control toy  maybe 
Im definitely picking up that hoodie
You know what I hope apple doesnt change the look for a long time Its not a bad look
Which music app servicestreaming you think is best I use Apple Music and Youtube Music premium but honestly have never tried Spotify
"I like the idea of dynamic island but its not worth upgrading for
And itll be old tech in a few years when they do under display lenses and theres no notch at all"
NO WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
You mean Apple copying its competitors
At 141  whats that left most widget
Roaming will skyrocket in usage and charges
So basically another garbage phone
People going crazy over a pill shaped hole 
"Dynamic island Already copied 
There is one Apk already out for android phones from the chinese developers and YouTube video for that  too"
That 48MP ProRaw looks amazing
Lets just call it the Di
I was thinking astrophotography as well Super sad it wasnt 
1505 so cute
Does it still use Lightning charging Yes Pass However turning the pill into the epitome of its not a bug its a feature was pretty clever
I LOVE HOW YOU JUST DROPPED IT
When safety is the main talking point theres not really an upgrade This is almost always true with every industry
"I feel like these reviews should mention that the iPhones are way way more expensive than 1000 nearly everywhere outside the US I feel like Apple knows that most reviews come from the US and thus they keep the price there low compared to their international pricing so that they get compared differently 
In Germany 999 get you the iPhone 14 and not the 14 Pro The 14 Pro Max goes for 1449 which is 200 more than the Galaxy S22 Ultra was when it was released"
I wonder where future flagships are going to copy from since LG left the smartphone scene
Pixel phone been doing crash detection since 2019
The quality edits and production in this channel is just whole deferent level
What wallpaper though  where can I find it
Bringing back the OG music 
"Its werid but dynamic island is so well designed that I am amazed it havent happened before

Is this a design to make a flip style fold iPhone With a smaller outer screen and having on the outside an Dynamic island sort of animations"
Remind pill  by Dre 
Im not here to see new iPhone Im here to watch one more masterpiece review made by my favourite YouTuber
If you think that apple did something new in the always on display then you should surely see oppo
I actually dont care about the damn dynamic island thing
hocus pocus as soundtrack funny 
Dynamic island is like freaking so cool 
Im not allowed to show the features of the phone as apple doesnt allows that proceeds to show every single feature there is on the phone 
Having a iPhone 6 in 2022 is so funny and watching the iPhone 14 pro is truly something 
"Someone from YouTube is gonna test crash detection 
Jerryrig  OH YEAH  "
Nice shout out to LG buddy 
Ive had an iPhone 8 for like 6 years Finally looking to upgrade would you recommend this as an upgrade
1326 I was about to say it Thanks 
When is apple gonna let u do their commercials 
"I know its just for the cool intro but its Ironic that you couldnt do those titles on the actual phone  Because the Dynamic Island cant light up all the way  Because its the slickest possible window dressing on the largest camerasensor screen hole in the industry

118  I already like the hoodie better than the phone  And I dont like hoodies

507  Well the metallic purple color is nice  I wish there was such a color for the S22 Ultra

1119  Yeah nothing here that any other phone doesnt do  And I really like how I can set edge marqueestyle lights on my S22 to emphasize the visibility of alerts  This is special effects to distract you from the ugliest hole punch of all time

1224  Youre probably right but I hope not at least for Samsung phones  I find the comparatively miniscule hole punch in the S22 Ultra display very distracting to the extent I have gone through the overly laborious process of hiding it for every app I use  But once done I dont have to see it anymore and I have virtually the same notificationstatus bar that I did with my old S8  As pretty as it admittedly is I REALLY dont need all this whizbang stuff to emphasize what I consider to be a very poor design decision  I held off on upgrading my old phone just because I was hoping Samsung would get their underdisplay camera working so I didnt have to deal with the hole punch  At least with Android Im pretty sure you can turn any comparable nonsense off

1422  Oh yeah theres ANOTHER horrible design decision thats still plaguing smartphones the camera island  SO pleased that the S22 Ultra blew that up

1808  Holy shit the iPhone 14 Pro has a racist camera  I kid I kid  Unclutch the pearls

So basically as the Great Emancipator supposedly said For those that like this sort of thing this is the sort of thing theyll like  A typical evolutionary but not revolutionary Apple release  If youre in the garden youll dig it  If not no biggie youll still be happy with what you have  Id still like a metallic purple phone but maybe dbrand will come out with a Sammyfriendly sticker or something  "
Why should I have to pay more for basically nothing Well the only reason Id buy it would be the satellite connection but thats already in other cheaper phones But other than that why should I pay for a minuscule upgrade especially with prices sky rocketing right now Read the room Apple
You missed the opportunity to talk about the band 70 chip thats in the new iPhones
"I thought about the graph you made and how each iphone since 6s has had 12MP
I knew you would mention that graph during your review of iPhone 14 pro"
Dinmic Islnd 
Nice hoodie Where can I get it
Good
Ive heard from some of my buddies that they wont upgrade to the iPhone 14 models since there wasnt much Currently they all have either the 12 or 13 models For me though Ive been rocking the 7 plus since 2015 so Ill take the refined update of the 14 pro without sweating it haha
Apppe needs to rename Dynamic notch
Theres no Tidal Now Playing MEH
Or if your like my mom and still have the iPhone 8 the new 14Pro  may be worth an upgrade 
Apple fan but highly highly dislike the Always On display
One day we going to have apple homes which are built by Apple
By the time we use satellite search in a stranded place iPhone battery would definitely die
"Does it have sim
Slot  Or is it completely esim "
Does anyone find the actual song of the intro The link in the description does not help Please 
Companies will follow
Also a good upgrade if you can get the 800 tradein for your two year old iPhone 12 and get the new phone for about 200 That made this a nobrainer for me
"Do you think the reason they compared A16 to A13 was to indirectly compare iPhone 11 and their new iPhone 14 series I know the A16 will be better than A15 just gotta do some math to compare I just imagine a large proportion of iPhone X seriesA12 bionic processor people were waiting for the new iPhone to upgrade to the iPhone 11A13 bionic processor
Apple maybe aiming so users just go for these NEW ones instead of just an upgrade 1kphone has me wanting to upgrade every decadeNote user Still have 10"
Dont forget to floss
So instead of getting rid of the notch like everyone wanted They used innovation to trick us into thinking its worth it even though they made it worst Thats apple for you
Actually Apple has not done a lot design wise Dont get me wrong but only changing the notch to a pill is not enough Is it now a completely new era or just a improved Iphone 13 Pro
The esim prevents 2 factor authentication fraud when people get their phone stolen and SIM card being put into another phone
You know I was excited for the Always on Display and assumed that Apple wouldve made it consume very little battery life But hearing Marques say otherwise is a little concerning to say the least
Pretty much everything Ive seen on the Dynamic Island is already done on Android either in the notification bar at the top with icons readouts info etc or in slide down notification UI extensions like music players etc  This IS already a copy of Android  Its just their version of the Android Notification bar and slide down UI and theyre pitching it like its some real new feature lol
14M views in 5 hours Thats insane Shows the hype new Iphone brings each year
That intro tune hit right in the feels
This dynamic island i wish they would put this on iP13Pro as well
Dynamic island More like People will eat on anything apple shits out 
what a intro damn
I love the name Dynamic Island What a smart and innovative way to use a space on the screen that felt annoying and intrusive Great review doe Im gonna probably wait until next year for an upgrade
Excuse me but the MP count of an iPhone is not continuous data and should not be represented with a line graph Thanks
Still S22 over this junk
Car crash maybe works when it detects a rapid car speed decrease or something
When is Apple gonna as the options to Toggle ur cam on 169 we need answers
I appreciate seeing that marques also starts his wordles with audio lol
"Hey dude So Im finally transitioning over from being a longtime Samsgung Sline user to iPhone Currently sitting with my S10 and Im caught between getting the 14 Pro this December or going with the 13 Pro

As a general phone user not a avid photographer or a crazy gamer who just wants a great phone is the 14 Pro a big enough change from the 13 Pro to warrant going with the more expensive newer model The camera upgrade A16 and even Dynamic Island doesnt seem like a strong enough reason for me specifically right now I feel like the 13 Pro was such an insane phone camera processor screen battery life all the general phone things that getting that for cheaper this winter seems like the smarter move for someone looking to just step strongly into the ecosystem for the first time

Any thoughtsrecommendations are much appreciated Love the vids Thanks in advance "
Apple really needs more than 2x Zoom 510 times zoom Ill buy one 
Few years back there was some concept on modular phones May be that would have been revolutionary in mobile industry but now small UI enhancement very granular level changes in hardware were made and sold in market as new generation mobile and people are loving it  Hard time
"Can we just talk about how AMAZING the depth of field on photos is though Holy hell WITHOUT portrait mode We are there people

Did you use portrait mode at all in these photos because if not that is AMAZING DoF for a phone"
A True reviewer would discuss how some of the socalled Newer features are already PREEXISTING on other phones shall we say  ANDROID PHONES
Intro is a masterpiece
This guy is getting more and more an apple fanboy The 14 is meh at best but this guy always makes iPhone seem amazing And then you see the back to school videos where he recommends 1000 pound MacBooks and iPhone and air pods to students
Where can we get that wallpaper from the start Its AWESOME
Is it worth getting coming from an iPhone 11 The only thing Ill miss about my current phone is the colour never been a fan of the more muted palettes of the pros
That case is ugggglyyyy
Not MKBHD casually boasting about breaking NDA lol
Actually more interested to see mkbhd take on Motorola edge 30 ultra  200mp camera should have made the attention Atleast
I would retain my iphone 13pro not worth upgrade at all
Why is it this incredible piece of engineering still rocking an ancient lightning port
The pill going to look great on other phones the gap to noticeable on iPhone
Getting rid of SIM is also good when phone is stolen Got pickpocketed in Paris four days ago While iPhone is locked they still tried to switch SIM to other devices and even though reported stolen Verizon almost let it roll
No USBC no care
What about finger printssmudging over the front camera since youre going to be touching it and around it so much
So the same phone
Lemme guess they will call the next iPhoneiPhone XV
Did you kill that lanternfly after snapping the shots of it I hope you killed the lanternfly anyway Great video as always Thanks for the insight
You are on 5m high  You dropped your iSuck 14 Pro Max  The phone will call the emergency  because it though that you have been in a crash  Police comes and the excuse that is your phones fault wont work  lol  So instead of this I moved in for a se 5G instead  cheap  a15 bionic  5G  home button  battery bruh  but in any case its ok for me
Man your intro are one of the best on YouTube hands down
"marques  when will apple bring always on display
also him  i dont really care about it"
19 percent of the battery was used by your cellular modem looking for a signal
Im coming from the iPhone 11 so I bought the 14 pro for the camera My iPhone works great but I use the camera the most
Im still using my 6s since day one I think im gonna pass on the 14 and get the 15 Im not that impressed
apple copied samsung edge its basically cheap ass edge version of edgeedge is way more functional what do sheeps get with this dynamic island its just another way of showing notification they could do some but theres no real function other than showing whats happeningconnecting or notifs
1403 I UNDERSTOOD THAT REFERENCE
Does unlock version still have a SIM card slot
Trash Im getting the 13 pro max So basically an always on display that eats battery A pill that cuts more into my content than the notch  no thanks
The satellite communication is one of those features where the people who are most like to need it probably already have better solutions at hand
Look at the positive its pretty close to a Star Trek communicator
You can clearly see in the 12 MP  48MP ProRAW comparsion that the AI still fucks up the images Pretty disappointing they arent able to fix this
Dynamic island really couldve been a ios 16 software update Imo apple is using a something basic to market a 1k phone and itll work Hey thats apple though
Hey bro what about battery life
they are not like even trying anymore with the design  lets ctrl c  ctrl v people will buy it anyway 
Me watching this from my iPhone 7
Sorry but I cant buy this IPhone why only eSim  Sorry Apple I really do
Hopefully you crushed that Lanternfly
This is copied from samsung cover screen
No sim card support is a deal breaker for me I have no idea how this benefits the consumer iPhone already had eSIM support on the previous models why try to force eSIM on us I travel abroad very often and this just doesnt work for me no charger no earphones on the box no headphone jack they cant keep getting away with this bs
Make a hoodie with a zipper and Ill buy it right away
Bro can I have the old phone I want to gift it to my wife Thank you in advance and have a great day
Ill wait for the iPhone 20 My 13 is just fine same damn phone with few more useless features
Its pretty clear that Apple intends to provide a worldwide service like Google Fi but including sat service
Garbage
Damn I recently got the IPhone 13 pro max
"This already exist since already 5 years  
Apple okey no problem just give it a new name  dynamic island    Idiots will like it"
What is the allure with always on Just a big battery killer
They should have called it something elsemaybe 
Am I the only one whos also looking for the wallpaper mkbhd mind sharing
I see youre also a j cole fan
that is actually cool but seriously how this still has lightning port
If I have to touch the island constantly with my grimy greasy hands wont that affect the selfie cam
So they copied the Samsung S10 design and functions
Hoodie is fire 
Maybe this is just an android guy hating but I am not a fan of this notch dynamic island I want my notch to go away not come alive and make me look at it more No thank you
Good  completely unnecessary  Plug for DBrand
I guess its fair for android to copy one feature when Apple is coping literally most of Android features
Oh My God Is that the flag of Egypt hoodie D Love it
Imagine paying over 1000 for a phone to tell you that youve started a workout lmfao
Cool once Im in a car crash  I can check my phone to make sure
Im honestly waiting for them to put the usbc on the iphones to buy one
hahaha the Dynamic island on the Globe easter egg Ive finally found one of MKBHDs hidden easter eggs without outside help
making their notification alerts look pleasing around the cut out doesnt justify a whole new phone  this is like a tweak youd download in cydia
"Why arent you testing the satellite feature In the keynote they noted that it can be used just to provide your location when youre not within cell tower range Dont you have contacts at apple who can help you do a demonstration As you noted there is not much different with these phones with the exception of the few features that you are choosing not to test

I appreciate your review but why wasnt this included to me it is the feature of the iPhone 14 to gloss over it to talk about less important features feels lazy"
Ill pass on the dynamic Island  on my screen
I cant believe you of all people have 2871 unread emails 
nice Wordle flex LMAO
has there been any thing about screen refresh rate I remember that was a selling point for the 13 higher end phones
It will get copied unfortunately Android phones had cutouts for years and they never thought to make it move or useful in anyway Theyre literally NPCs compared to Apple Just another way Apple leads the pack theyre not always first but Apple always does it best
i hope this stuff is not copied
Your battery percentage is giving me anxiety
Make it beautiful Steve Jobs way Always works
Your new merch hoodie looks like my universitys logo lol
not sure who apple is even marketing to this cycle I cant see anyone upgrading who doesnt already need an upgrade The iphone 14 is basically the 13 and the iphone 14 pro is just the same story as the past years Namely modest upgrades to internals and cameras and pretty much nothing else Cant see nonpro users seeing the new iphone 14 pro and thinking i need this way more than i needed the iphone 13 pro
I really dont get the hype with the 14 you are literally buying an iPhone 13 with an interactive notch 
Oh god I hope not  Dumbest copy of an android thing ever
Wallpaper info PLZ
yeet the phone out the window
People are complaining about the notch dynamic island but they are literally just talking bs Watching a movie you dont even nothing the notch unless you go full screen If you want to watch a movie on your phone full screen I think you are the problem not the notch Yesterday I watched full screen and enjoyed a show What notch iPhone 13 Pro user
The always on display featured only time in Samsung and other phones But apple used it in another level showing everything on the display
Im beginning to hate Motorola because of the ads
When you really think about ittheres a number of apps that you can download that enables most of this featuresif you using an androidthat a lot of people think are newbut that not being the caseall they did was predownload the apps
"it slightly affecting battery life more than I expected
what could you expect when you have all the pixels turned on all the damn time
the deal with always on display on samsung and other android phones is that very few pixels are turned on pixels that consume energy to be on to make light
if you have them ALL on even on lower power and low refresh rate they ALL WILL consume energy making this always on display function way less effective compared to android phones"
Im getting the 14 Pro Max because thats a huge upgrade on video and I shoot parts of all my videos on iPhone so thats a good enough reason for me 
Said connecting airpods twice lmao
Dynamic bar should be cool
Well theres no always on display on the iPhone 12 Pro The the display panels different I think
Do I hear seagulls or someone laugh when you mention Dynamic Island at 845 Nice touch lol
"Again its crazy how far ahead apple chips compared to Qualcomm 
Its like been taken for granted to the point that its not worth htting over Qualcomm with every chip release
The A16 is almost 40 faster than Qualcomm 8 gen 1 chip in Geekbench
Thats mind bending"
Regarding touch sensitivity I would actually assume there is no difference between the dynamic island and the screen Did you test that Its much easier to just make everything a touch screen because its not the pixels that detect the touch but a separate layer on top Cant really think of any drawbacks of putting that layer across the whole screen
the second screen on lg v10 was amazing
"Everyone

Thats how stupid are some ppl"
NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES STICKING WITH MY 2016 SE
Y con el dedo te la pasas ensuciando la cmara gracias a esa brillante idea 
LOL such a let down real Apple supporters are tired of Apple just doing minor things even Steves Daughter all that praise Apple now are just paid reviewers like this channel and people that have not been there since  the beginning
I like that you tell us how you feel about the phone and that the review is much more better than the iPhone review itself and I was wondering if you will be doing any giveaway soon
1323 MKBHD giving respect to one of greatest phones released was unexpected but appreciated
cant afford one but off course every year cant miss the reviews and the upgrades 
I dont like the Dynamic Island coming in the way when watching a movie
Ive noticed with Apple Watch whenever I chop wood it thinks I took a hard fall Could have similar issues with crash detection
very cool
Dynamic Island just looks like an advanced pop up menu
My mom has always said better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it The crash detection and the satellite connectivitysos feel like Apple was thinking along those lines
That pill is ugly as fuck Its massive
That gave me the goosebumps the delivery of fact at 1325 
Dynamic island and AoD features made me preorder no matter the higher price in Europe Cant wait hopefully it arrives on Friday
Battery life could be worse due to the brighter screen
Why isnt that AOD available for the older models Dont explain why youd need a new phone for that but dont include a charger because of environment Yeah sure
Staying with my 13pro max for another year
The number of people that actually need 4k let alone 8k on a phone is essentially none If someone NEEDS 8k its probably for some sort of crazy cropping scenario or related to some sort of professional work If thats the case they probably have a professional camera If you gave the normal consumer 8K Genius bars would be constantly packed with people complaining that their phones are running out of memory too quickly
Its cool what they did with the integration of hardware and software with the islandbut honestly it seems more invasive than the notch Wasnt that the point of people wanting the notch removed  Granted I havent used it but from everything I see it looks worse when watching a videoetcI dont think it will last long I think it is just a stepping stone to completely removing it
I really dont care about  dynamic island nor the always on display  For the pro max I like the 2000 nit  larger screen and large battery
That Dynamic Island is just so big on the screen when watching a video 
Windows phone had the best always on display
That was a really fun intro
"While world declared notch as an abomination effectively getting rid of it Apple named it iSland 
Naming wont change it though Neither would it make it disappear"
"2022 what Apple fans are celebrating is always on display
"
What about a roller coaster
well the iPhone copied the Always on Display too
Boss review
I dont know much about phones old guy  but I can tell this guy has drank the koolaid  baby 
YouTube advertisements have become so annoying 
Im switching from an iPhone XR to the 14 Pro so its going to be quite a significant change for me
MKBHD  please share the link of your iphone 14 pro max wallpaper in this video I realise love it
Buy the iPhone 15 pro max It will be USBC And all the features of 14 pro max
Back in the day I bought lg v10 and lg v 20 bought them for the hi fi dac and b and o headphones However I was pleasantly surprised by their implementation of a second screen for notifications music and so on but I gave up on Lg after v30 plus Lg was definitely a frontrunner for innovation but fared bad wrt the cameras software ui and most importantly software updates Also  in my opinion LG marketing team was pretty bad and I would definitely consider giving raise and offer some stock to the apple marketing team for turning whats clearly a negative as a major selling point maybe the aura of the brand helped too
Which phone charger are you using The one with a pad that you placed the phone on
The iphone mini and now the always on display were begged to apple to implement and both were met with lukewarm praise when they finally delivered  The customer isnt always right
The Island is still way to big 
Nice Easter egg in the top right corner of the phone at 1144
This would be a great upgrade if your current apple ecosystem device is like the 12 or XR Was hoping the latest green would carry over to the 14 pro lineup but oh well Great review though
Bro ur just a slave now to apple
Thing is you can get in touch with emergency services regardless When you dial 911 by law any available network will route your call If there isnt one available the call is routed through a military network That call is going to happen
Dynamic whatever is stupid its just marketing for  we are really struggling to hide the notch I prefer to not stretch my finger all the way to the top of my screen to tap a noti the same way I hated certain high placed buttons on ios
The song used in the intro is the same as the one from the 10 million subscribers milestone video Still my favorite video to date
No one is going to talk about that still 60hz screen where 120hz is now the norm and provide a great extra smoothness  No  Cmon marques you cant say to an Android phone oh look it doesnt go to 120 its bad and just simply ignore it on iphones
Tell me something that this island can displaydo while the little android notification bar and notification center isnt doing already And when the island is expended the wifi icon etc disappeared This is going backward not forward Dont be fooled by pretty animation
8k is a gimmick when it comes to mobile phones
Watching this from iPhone 7 
So right I had the LG V10 Was a under rated phone
Wow you know what youre talking about My secondary phone is still the LG V20
Woah  The photos looks unbelievable
Wallpaper link please
Always on display turns off in sleep mode 90 of why I wanted it was a more convenient clock at night
Im just not in a spot to afford a new phone
I can no longer flex that i have the best iPhone
pixel 7 pro on the way 
Oh man marques That LG reference was a really good recall
i really hope you smacked that lanternfly at 1556 after you filmed it
The production seems to have gone up a notch
Those good old days of LGI still remember using V10 and was like this is quite useful and fun
This guy is mystified that having an always on display feature  affects his battery life Wow
Just say it apple has nothing new to offer anybody except to take a lot more of their money because they are so brainwashed There is a small pocket device available Nationwide for 20 that you can use for emergency use It connects to satellite from anywhere so you can talk to emergency services Thats a hell of a lot cheaper than a new iPhone And Android years ago had the ghost display where the screen would go black went on standby in the clock would slowly pull send Emily and fade back out for maximum battery efficiency and that one way because nobody really cared that much So this is Apples new idea is to have the clock on at full brightness and any other artwork that you have before the screen should have went dark how the hell is this being more efficient on your battery when you said it does good the last stuff all day now My pics of iPad for 4 years and its still lasts today and a half with quite a bit of usage Apple is always copied everybody after the fact wireless charging night time photography astrophotography long battery life and on and on and on Apparently they have no one to come up with ideas so they just copy everybody elses once they think of it and introduce it in commercials like theyre the only people that have it and Apple phone users never look up so they dont know that theyre paying for old almost obsolete software and think they got the latest hottest truck stuff Just a bunch of damn zombies 
1143 niceee
LG V10 was ahead of its time Had there been OLED it wouldve worked even better
Dynamic island is a clever name and the new iPhone is goated dont  me
We constantly allow apple to do little to nothing between phone versions and somehow we pay them more and pretend they are improving customization and innovations smh  They literally space out their features that other phones already offer just to save them for the next phones new features smh  They made an eye sore notch with software features no one really needed and added software to the camera already found everywhere else that we should have gotten at least last year  We have to demand better  Butits good for what its good for
I feel Dynamic island is temp feature until apple get rid of notch
We do not use e sim in Italy Not at all There only is one carrier with e sim but never heard anyone using it
Please make a review of new Hassy camera 
"Android lol haha dumb notch moves

Android in 3 years ok so we call it the moving atoll unique I know"
So informative MB Excellent review very professional
When is iOS 16 update coming
"This dynamic island is nothing more than a cheep marketing scheme a cheep way to own the cut out i switched to iphone a couple of months back and to this day the thing i hate most about this phone is the ergonomics everything is on top every thing is hard to reach every little action requieres finger streach and tension
This new feature only makes things worse move mpre features to the ergonomically worst place on the phone If apple would have said every one is doing a cut out so will we i would have at least repected them this is just a cheap poorly thought out gimic"
This Intro was one of weakest intros in your recent videos Long low quality and not very creative Sorry for being critical but I have been enjoying your intros a lot and this one is a let down

"So now when you plug in your phone it shows up the charging info on the dynamic island but its very small before it would show up in the center of the screen Thats just one example the charging one
Not sure if this dynamic island is good in terms of visibility and saving time if you cant see you gonna have to pick up the phone wasting more time"
Its gonna be hard but i have to wait for USBC next year at that point there will really be no use in upgrading every year anymore we can get back to waiting 23years to upgrade 
The cinematic mode already had 30fps and not 24 which was an oxymoronapple correctly fixed that issue by adding 24fpsyou got it backwards 
I really dont see a lot of practicality in the dynamic island functionother than hiding the hole
Which wallpaper is that
Basically its just a more expensive software upgrade
Ty
30fps really My phone has 60fps
My favorite word from his videos is peace 
that intro though
a new 48 megapixels sensor thats gonna bend down to 12 megapixels for all your normal photos what does this mean
Same old crap
at 1812 I laughed a little I was biking whole summer and have same exact white strip from watch D
one eye open when im sleeping
Im with you Im turning off the Always On display same way I turned it off on my s21 Ultra Pointless imo Just tap the phone
Isnt iphone 14 pro supporting 30watts charging now That is fast comparing to the older ones
Maybe just DI instead of Dynamic Island
1300 my soul left me 
Until you mentioned the hoodie I just assumed you were a Portland Trailblazers fan
We in the Caribbean usually buy the US models of the iPhone with esim only which is not available here yet I think the cut out this entire region of sales
why does it have to start at 1300 euros tho 
I was hoping more from Cupertino I think the gas and bills affected them so muchCome on we are already in 2022 
I get the new Dynamic Island feature cool and all but with 13pro and 14 pro feeling the same for a regular none videophoto making person those camera bumps are a huge dislike
How does the Dynamic Island eat into Youtube VideosNetflix
More maricon designs forced into straight hands
Who actually needs always on display anywayI mean u hit one button an ur where u need to be an not wasting battery for the 99 of the time ur not looking at it lol
Any concerns for screen burnin with AOD
My iPhone 12 contract was ending this year so I pretty much needed to switch my phone for the 14 Im a UI artist and the dynamic island was the feature that convinced me to go with the pro for the first time The nonpro model is pretty underwhelming this year to be honest
The island camera processor and lack of USBC isnt enough for me to upgrade from my 13 Pro Max Hopefully the 15 comes with USBC then Ill upgrade
Upgrading from an IPhone 8 to this 14 pro  completely skipping the notch rofl
iPhone 14 Pro Review This has been Copied should be the title
I really love the iPhone 14 Pro design and as it is quite them same as the 13 model previously but significantly the camera is bigger within some extra aspects of an new way to unlock and customise
Always on display is just another thing that apple use to make people phone addicted
do the fingerprints show up on the selfie camera
Still no USB C  slow charging speeds and really slow transfer speeds Its all about money again with this 12 year old lightning port
Life is good with LG
Marques your cinematography is on another level 
I havent watched the video and stop to give a like That intro is awesome
Summary If you have a iPhone 11 or newer dont upgrade
Android already switches between background apps with a swipe Nothing innovative about this feature
How easy is it to use eSims when your traveling in other countries  I have heard that Telcel in Mexico is not supporting esims yet
Please gift me iPhone 14pro max
I have an iPhone 8 should I upgrade 
Nice iPhone apple copy its ok
"Im blown away about how tech savvy Marques is This guys breathes superb technology skills and flare that I find amazing
God is good"
Dynamic Island could have been pefectly done on current notches with the same functionality change my mind
damn over a million views already the intro is dope
So no one is talking about the fingerprints that will always be on the front camera
Test crash detection in the next Auto Focus episode
Lets keep real it looks nice but it aint worth upgrading to iPhone 14 if you got anything from iPhone 1113 even the x models I would say but in the end of the day it depends on you if you feel for it go get it 
Pre ordered
I love the background soundtrack when the video start up Marques its a good vibes
Dynamic island is just notch with notification bar
What happened to the battery percentage that was at the top right Was it removed from the 14 Pro
Watching all of this on my stillgoingsolid OnePlus 6T This definitely has to be a crime isnt it
Okay Marques I see that subtle Hasselblad flex
Cant help but comment on the song Kanye West  Good Morning  
"LG V10 was just trying to compete with Samsung edge dual screen then
D island is like Samsung edge original creative feature but I agree to the point that rest of the folks will go crazy to copy it"
Shoutout to old intro music
Correction the dynamic island has already been copied by someone and can be used by redmi themes
You know when someones been wearing a watch for a long time by their wrists lol
Dope intro
OK lets got back to dial up
I really like the wallpaper on your iPhone can I get it somewhere
Oh boy going from a s21 to the pro max im afraid its not that good
Perfect upgrade for my 32 GB iphone 7
Love this insightful review
U could test it by going to the theme park then play bumper car  see if it works
What will be copied  dynamic island What for and by whom If almost every android phone has no notch or a tiny one that doesnt have to be hidden by any funny attempts like the ones from apple
Iphone V10
They turned their weaknessnotch into strengthdynamic island
moment of silence for the elite intro
Good that Apple is going back to their old roots of making a S phone with this new iPhone 13s
Yes getting those few pixels between the cutout and the top bezel that really cant be used for anything is sooo much better than a notch somehow This was the most underwhelming release ever to me With all of its warts the Pixel line seems to be doing more interesting things at this point by a good margin
No mention about moviesvideos with Dynamic Island What if you dont want DI to run backround Is it possible to disable 22min review and we didnt hear anything new Im pretty disappointed with this review
apple is shit just android  xiaomi
1116 you said connecting airpods twice
1036 Are you okay Marques Why does it say SOS on the top right of the phone
If android users want it Edge mask app Totally customisable Lol Apple is a joke
Google FI is the answer for international travel with a E sim
Thank you for the video and thanks for your honest opinion Marques
You didnt show the flash
I personally would prefer a bit smaller notch instead of this There will still be some pseudousefull pack of pixels above the island and they could easily adapt a notch to such purpose It seems like mostly samsung smartphone users are targeted with this one as it still is a big piece of market to devour Ill wait
Can we stop saying low key out loud
To sum it up for me  Buy the iPhone 13 pro max instead of the 14 pro max
What is that wallpaper
mkbhd That is one of the sweetest coolest sweat shirts I have seenbuying one now 
no USB C port and still dumb lightning BS
If only Apple would adopt USB C I might just switch to iPhone
Nice video man Thnx for info
Why nobody talked about the decreased selfie camera quality because of now more frequent smudges directly to the camera
The Dynamic Island is in my opinion a scam Its basically a notch But more than anything its a solution to the notch problem that has already been solved by the phones with no more notch
RIP the Dark Sky app
Solid review
What about in EU its 13k e
The tiniest detail I noticed in this video is the battery percentage is back on the battery
"That LG shout out reminded me of that old me total fan of the LG flagships before going with Motorola then switching to iPhone then loving Xiaomi then back to the iPhone

Well back to the point LG was quite important they had pretty crazy ideas that pushed the phone to go beyond I still can remember the LG G3s camera 2k display 4k pictures looked fucking amazing there"
Iphone 13 vs Motorola Ultra edge 30 Help me guys
"It will automatically call emergency services
USA citizens automatically in debt of 5000 dollars"
bs update
People inspired by this island  plz give your 5 mints to samsung s22 ultras full screen display and enjoy the real full screen without any chunky and big sized notch island 
I ride motorcycles I think that the crash detection and satellite emergency call features will be amazing for us bikers who do long touring
Nice seagull sound when highlighting the dynamic island in the intro
Eh not enough for me to upgrade from my 12 pro max  the pill is good though mostly a gimmick  I dont even use the features on my pro max I just point and shoot my battery life is fine
It should have been called 1325
iPhone 14 pro looks like a mini in your hands 
All the normies have to wait till Friday
I think the crash detection would not be accidentally triggered because it senses sudden changes in the g force and that amount of g force is rarely reached in our everyday activities
Nungguin komen nya orang indo
"But I feel when you will touch multiple times on Dynamic Island to switch between apps that frequent touching will keep the selfie camera smudged all the time Just a thought 
Also with IOS 16 I dont see Always on display in iPhone 13 max pro though it supports a low refresh rate till 10Hz What are your thoughts"
Im still debating I have a iPhone 13 Pro Max should I change is it even worth the money
I think Dynamic Island sounds cool Or call it DI Or just The Island I think Island is cooler than Pill Cuz calling it Island is an homage to how Apple just always innovates Its not a bug  its a feature Classic Turning something nothing wanted or liked into something you cant help but imagine how it was ever any other way previously
You seem burn out with Apple products You dont like any of the new features
"No different really to my iPhone 13 Pro
My 14 Pro comes next week buzzing "
The Island should turn into an i when video play back is on
1300 I love the way he discreetly showed the way youre gonna smudge your selfie camera all the time 
So glad he mentioned how iPhone selfie cameras handle darker skinned folks Ive always noticed that selfies on Samsung cameras come out better than they do on iPhones in those scenarios
Always on display not being able to be customized to just be blackwhite is a shame Thats the whole point of always on display to show helpful info without noticeably affecting battery life
The island thing could be done to the basic notch too but the marketing wont let that happen I think they should have at least done that or why would I buy the iphone 14 over 13
I just dont understand I am still using my Note 9 512GB I got on release day with a 1TB Micro SD I love everything about it except the lack of replaceable battery I frequently plug in a HDMI  ethernet  USB3 dongle and use Samsung DeX which is a great laptop alternative in a pinch Thats the ONLY time I wish my phone was a little more powerful Apple is moving exactly the opposite direction with what I want out of a phone
Microphone hears loud noise so the mic was on all time in iPhone
In conclusion  If you have money Just buy it or anything with an apple logo on it
An incremental spec bump and some mostly pointless new features that 90 of people neither asked for nor will use Good year to skip upgrading
its worth to compare the pro to the max The argument to most getting the pro is that its better so you can reach dynamic island better which is kinda a big part of the phone Wonder whats your thought about that
nice video whats me interest is the battery life im on an iphone 12 pro max 
I wonder what message notification looks like on the island for example from iMessage or Twitter
Anyone find this background Its stellar
Honestly samsung has best ALWAYS on displays With customisation and a lot more control and truely useable Always on display while apple has just widget for lock screen which is already way more behind than one UI of samsung
iPhone already copied samsung
I really hope not
Friday I will be upgrading from the Xr to the 14 pro max Early birthday gift
Is there a chance of screen burn with always on display
On LG 10 years ago was cheet now with apple is great Ooops apple is a American brand made in China but is still cheet
Removing Sim slot is enough for me to not buy iPhone 14 from US This is a horrible decision by Apple Not sure why Marques not criticizing this enough This IS a big deal for frequent international travelers
meh5
no vejo a hora do meu chegarrrrr ta perfeito
Feel free to jump into the conversation but I actually started on the 7 plus as my first iPhone and then upgraded to the 12 pro max when it came out Which I think is an upgrade right Im not deeply into iPhone or upgrade each time a new one comes out but as an iPhone user the words Better Camera and Longer Battery Life seems to be getting passed around for a while now lol
The dynamic island is nothing but a floating notification bar Nothing more nothing less And Im tired of people acting like its more than that
Man that intro was so fine i heckinn loved it
Knee PT I hope youre well and healthy
love the mention of LG V10
The way Apple processes photos looks way too crunchy and low detail compared to a Pixel
The digital sim is going to be done in New Zealand I think but would have to confirm when mine arrives
Wonder how crash test works when you are at an amusement park on rides
Is there a way to turn on the pixels in between the pill and the camera
times font 
Where can I find that wallpaper
Apple really did a good job with Pro series but 14 is just copy paste
Dynamic Island on Android please copy this idea in the nav bar at the BOTTOM of the phone for reachability
"The REDs reflection is seen in the intro shot with the probe lens part of me tells that they left in there deliberately to flex 
And the iconic sweatshirt with Disarm as the opening music track  clutch MKBHD"
Personally have always hated the holepunch trend and Apple making it a thing means its not going away any time soon because companies will copy the dynamic island  Its ugly and takes up unnecessary screen real estate
Cinematic Mode has always been 30fps  in fact ONLY 30fps Whats new is they added 24fps
Im coming from an iPhone X going to an iPhone 14 pro maxall of the changes are a difference for me 
no cutout at all is so much better than a gimmick to try and hide it OnePlus 7 Pro for the win
Excited to trade in my iPhone 13 Pro on Friday for the iPhone 14 ProIm on the iPhone every year plan with Apple
Cant believe I watch a Samsung Ads in Apple iPhone Review 
MILLION AND A HALF views in 5 hours  Blandroid could only wish Great job 
nice hoodie havent seen it before
"Brownlee threw the phone down

Me dont do that try to respect the phone that cost more my every year phone combine"
12m in 5 hours and not on trending
First they get rid of theheadphone jack and then the charger and now Sim card Fail
iPhone 17 update  new button grip
Well the functions slapped on the horizontal capsule is cool but the capsule itself is not cool I hate my screen being chopped out by some weird stuff Just like u said I dont see anything special abt the always on pattern I like the fact that the fone will be very fluid in operations and I like iPhone app closing animation so much Other than that its just there Melh
"Me looking at leaks meh looks mid

Trailer comes out okay you got me apple"
I wonder if its possible to turn on the dead pixels between the front camera and Face ID components Jailbreak maybe
Honestly Im impressed by your simplistic unbaised review Marques theres over hype and over praise for ip14 which isnt true and most upgrades are minimal too
"What about the last 3 seconds of the key note late week Has anyone talked about what Apple is hinting at 

Looks like there is a lady waiting to hop on the train it barely lasts and the the video ends abruptly"
i hope we are able to turn off the always on display
that pill notch is ugly afguess we are upto android to get a notchless full display
As an android user yeah the island thing is kinda cool but its just makeup for an ugly camera setup it has Good for them to cleverly cover it up
I believe that the g force sensor would not produce any accidental triggers I just think its kinda impossible to generate large amounts of gs accidentally a fall or even throwing the phone would not even compare to the gs generated from a crash If the sensor is well done which it probably is itll only activate with inhumane amounts of gs
What does mkbhd meant with overexpose
1023 andrew just appered but no tate note it down
"its seems like marques has nothing to say about i phone because there is no new  features added 
imagine what would happen to i phone 15 same phone as last year same design new colour one new feature
and increasing price for no reason  i phone is slowly becoming an andriod phone copying similar features etc"
Can you just switch off the always on display completely I really dont think I have a use for it But other than that it looks rather good Ill be pleased with it when I get it
just put everything camera sensors etc under the display and be done with it already This island looks so dumb worse than notch
Lg v10 is more like the Touch Bar in MacBook The concept is a but different
Also a 1000 or sub 1000 price point is deceptive For that price you will only get 128GB storage Not a lot so most people will go for at least 256GB as a starting point  Unless you are one of the few people that never take pictures Yes you can upload all your pics to google or apple but then you will be running out of storage all the time at 128GB Also someone on a really really tight budget will be buying a cheep Android phone not am iPhone
"Apple Dynamic Island

Android Cybernetic Organism"
lets call Dynamic Island as DI
"Marques i dont like the approach you represent the new iphones with pretty basic face expressions looks like sick 
When I started playing this video I had many expectations but thats not the case Arun still does the best May be you should consider"
How can I become a reviewer
308 bruhhhh lmao
Hate to say it but I knew exactly what the new one was gonna look like before it came out
"16 Million Followers
Congratulations "
I wonder if the Dynamic Island will be shady towards Google operated apps   Honestly I preordered the 14pro   cause it looks like 90s prince Batman Im impressed with the Dynamic Island but I hope in hides or integrates when watching video Thanks again
The intros on this channel are 
The dynamic iland is pretty cool not going to lie but I would rather have a punch hole selfie camera and eventually a under display camera whenever its possible
ur intros are becoming next level
What happened to high refresh rate display Is it still there
sticking with my 11 pro until i get usb c dear god im gonna have this phone forever arent I
Did marques just openly admit to breaking a NDA
Dynamic Island is a pretty smart idea from Apple
Copy what exactly They only did it because of the stupid giant cutout it mostly does things that other OSs already do I cant believe the level of complacency everyone is showing here
Can we remove Dynamic Island It makes me nervous
9o
I wanna share a problem with iphone 13 pro and 13 pro max In bangladesh region after updating phones become completely white or green Pls dicuss about the problem and what will be the solution
Hoping on to the iphone 14 pro myself coming from my samsung a12 I think it will be a significant upgrade Ive had both apple and android before i honestly think theyre both amazing at what they do For me Im hoping for a better camera system that is quite a let down on my A12 I could probably have gone with the s22 ultra but I think apple overall will be better for video and photos Guess Ill just have to wait and see 
Ahhhh new iPhone season The only time I get mkbhd recommendations on my feed
For those who are Android fans how would you compare the iPhone 14 Pro to the Pixel 6 Pro
I agree with not wanting other brands to copy this design I really dont like it I much rather they try to improve under the screen cameras
The dynamic island is just a gimmick you can easily add it to older models with an update it is just a fancy notification bar
Cash grab
dont worry next year they will implement 8k and sell it as main point of iphone 15 pro D
Phone makers need to pay this man He drives or diminishes  product sales based on his opinion
What if youre on a rollercoaster Police show up at six flags
im pretty sure they came up w the dynamic island after the HORRIBLE repercussion of the the  i  cut out they got away it was a smart movement and turned out really well
How many people are facing white screen  problem in 13pro max 
To be honest Ill wait for iPhone 15 pro max and the USBc connector that hopefully comes with it I still have a samsung 8 plus and its dying xd
Apeape unim aneh ndek yak beli
definitely feels like if the iphone 14pro screen protector gets shattered with cracks the front camera will also be blurry
Hoodie season It was 105 in so cal last week 
And Xiaomi will do it first as always
Imma call it the sausage 
Love how they snagged samsungs idea Been saying the pinhole is SO MUCH BETTER than notch forever
Holy shit what an intro man 
Great vid Guess the embargo really was holding off MKBs bursting desire to upload and todays finally it But hey Marques dont forget about the Apple Watch Ultra and Im counting on your topnotched review
I know its not worth it for people going from a 13 to 14 but what about a 11 pro max to a 14 pro max 
Looks amazing Just not affordable for people like me
You are not gonna checking that ant what What is purpose of you tubers then just telling which color looks good   not accepting from you
dynamic island  apple  sugar coat of cant think of a way to remove the notch
Why does it feel like they are going backwards on the phone design
where can I get that wallpaper
Getting my iPhone 14 Pro Max on Friday and Im excited Upgrading from an iPhone 12
"Cant believe that imessage a freaking messaging app facetime a freaking video calling app are listedmentioned as featuresadvantages ARE WE REALLY LIVING IN 2022

Ps I mean yes having imessage and facetime in america is really an advantage because your life is a hell as you wont be able to properly do those things ie those basic stuff if you use an android phone when everyone else around you ie the majority of the society around you is using that and communicating that way But this is nothing to be proud of for a phone and a thing to be mentioned as features or advantagesperks  that too especially in 2022 when messaging and video calling are the most basic stuff that everyone in the world uses and is not some special thing offered by anya phone lol by a tech youtuber but instead its a thing to be ashamed of for that phone and definitely not a thing to be mentioned as features or advantagesperks forof a phone by a tech youtuber"
Did anyone else get like 105 ads during this video
Samsung better not copy that stupid island
I honestly think Apple has lost it They are now on a maintenance program The Invention edge has departed from shores of Apple a long time ago
iOS 17 predictions more lock screen customization including for alwayson mode
Can we get a review of the actual 14 and the 14 max I think some people are gonna take this a review of those I wish wed be able to have reviews of not just the pro phones
Idk but I kinda prefer a clean looking screen than all those features in exchange of that large pill Even just a strand of hair distracts and annoys me so much when Im watching a video what more a large pill And honestly I dont think itd be copied officially by other brands some fan made themes maybe
Seriously considering getting the IPhone 14 Pro Max But I have been on a android operating system since forever now Ill wait till we get a Pixel 7 Pro Review to determine which phone I decide to get Lately Ive become more of a sucker for phone cameras and I know Google never fails to deliver in the camera department with their phones
Where did you get that background from I love it and want it
Did this guy just drop an IPhone 14
Solid Take that iphone 11 and later folks dont have to buy new pro to have a new phone feeling iOS 16 itself will make the phone feel good Waiting for reviews on its performance on iphone 11 pro before I upgrade to iOS 16
Can you set Always On Display to turn off based on specific focuses
Love that intro song I remember it being there for the iPhone 10 review
You already know I mean you both top of the food chain but if that Samsung user rolls up on their high end models they gonna shut you down  Flossy Carter
"The dynamic island is just so strange Its basically a top screen widgetnotification shade in one where the user has to stretch their finger to tap around their selfie cam to use it for multitasking 

Apple again inventing solutions to problems that dont exist"
Does the padlock icon constantly stay on the always on display The time keeps changing but what about the padlock Icon being in the same spot all the time Burnin
Hey marques is the 14 pro max battery better than the 13 pro max battery
It is so cold in California now
Im team Samsung but damn who else enjoys the iPhone reviews
Itll be fun to see how many companies rushing towards UDCs actually bring back the hole punch and copy dynamic island
Pro or pro max 
Thats such a stupid feature doe what will happen to it when there is no pill shape This island is just a coverup You guys ask for it to go away apple said no we cant we arnt advanced and are not there yet so here is this coverup so you guys feel like we are listening and we care This iPhone 14 is such a waste I have the iPhone 13 and for some reason I keep thinking I have the iPhone 12 I need to go to my setting under general to be like oh yeah I do have an iPhone 13 not 12
Still no usbc lol
Its all about the cameras Yessir All I need every time
So buying iPhone 13 pro case would be good fit for my 14 pro
It says good morning kanye west 
did you put tensor there just for bullying seriously that thing needs some cathing up to do even the exynos bodies it right
Always on display not cool 
"Great video again one thing I have been hearing from the UX Community is that the Dynamic Island is out of the thumb zone for most onehanded users but it doesnt really kinda make it bad by any means Just felt like I could share it down here

The intro is "
If tech companies wanted to cue cancer or world hunger they would have what nonsense is always on display 
Great video One comment on Cinematic mode That I think users should know about Check your setting on your iphone 13 pro max and on the iPhone 14 pro max But on the 13 cinema mode is only 1080P 30 The 14 pro max will shoot 4K30 Maybe 24FPS also but I am not sure Now this is a big deal if I am right You say in your video that the only upgrade is that the 14 now shoots in 30FPS I have heard this same thing from other videos I have watched k in cinematic mode is a big deal that others should know about 4K dolby vision is way better that any 1080P video
1817 that dog is angwy
Phones do be sounding like its out of a drunkenly improvised Rick and morty episode nowadays ngl With all the bionic silicone upgrade with new nanoparticles whatever the hell chip And apparently now my phones got nits I aint want no nits get that out of here and now all of a sudden my phones got a skin tone Will We need to give it independence now thats way too much work I dont want a war over phone rights apple you ruined it with all your fancy buzzwords
How did u make a better clip than apple themselves
Nothing much change
"My question  would bewho is involved in e sim technologyI bet this is the start controlwe know how Apple likes to keep you tied down so if others can benefitthey certainly will

They obviously cut someone out of money by going e sim route

There must be a reason and backstorynot something you do just because youre bored and wanna try new things"
now the big question does it worth over Pixel 6 pro and the coming Pixel 7 pro 
1  feature 99  hype
so Life is Good on the Dynamic Island 
Can I have an old iPhone  Im from Sri Lanka 
Intro is top notch
I want to find that beautiful wallpaper
Does it overheat and dim the screen as often as the other iPhones or nah
Could they have brought this to phones after iphone X YES
I bet riding a motorcycle will trigger the crash detection
Im totally okay with esim only and I travel a lot lately been using only e sims abroad because hated to replace physical sim and price for e sim data abroad is not so bad always cheaper than US cell service
Kearny  You live in New Jersey bro 
"Dynamic Island is quite cool looking tho could suffer the same fate as the Touch Bar on MacBook Pro time will tell

Apple clearly knows how to execute things well others may invent the ideas and concepts like Xerox with the GUI tho takes Apple to show us how to do it justice"
Id like see it against the vivo x80 pro or the Xiaomi 12s Ultra
Hope the crash detect dosent work in thailand because i surley dont wanna go to a government hospital  Youd have to call a private one for transport
This guy is getting old with trying to sell you merch on every video spends 8 hours on the intro and 2 minutes on the review
I think having no sim tray is going to be extremely good for TMobile with their world wide service  I switched from Verizon to TMobile specifically because I travel a lot internationally and I do not have to pay a dime extra while traveling
Love the tribute to Graduation by Kanye West Happy 15th year 
I wonder how much will be this new iphone in Vancouver Canada iPhone 14 pro max plus all the sales tax
iPhone 15 pairs with your Apple Watch to read your biometrics when youre dead and lets the authorities know your organs are ready to harvest 
When apple copys something they seem to make it cooler lol
You can have an external sim card tray if needed  And also you can buy a charger Also u can have a screen protector and a case If u need to take notes  you can buy a apple pencil Finally if u want to take a call buy another android phone 
Its just the money its always the money
Now that it can zoom to 2x without losing quality the 3x zoom lens feels to be a bit too close to that 2x zoom Something like 4x would be better
the black bar always there is unsettling honestly but well people will love bc its apple I guess
Hey Marques how are the still getting away with lightning port I thought EU making USB C mandatory
wtf without the sim card I dont know if i can buy this thing now
We need pothole detection so it remembers where you hit a pot hole and alerts you when your getting close to it
Ive been telling people constantly that iPhone 6s really is the game changing iPhone I went from a 6S to an iPhone 12 Pro when it was released Its clear as day that Apple has been using the 6S model as a basis to improve each year Im also glad that you recognized that the Dynamic Island is not a new feature and has been used on previous LG models
You not being photographed perfectly surely is a crime of some sort Glad to hear it has been fixed
Stop taking photos while driving wtf Why do big names think thats an ok thing to post
I just want a full screen iphone 
731 summary for the new improvements Minimal and lazy
Why does the intro look like pixelated 720p trash
Ne poda ne pande udayippa
Fun fact you missed every time you open your front camera it is burry due to all the finger smudges on the dynamic island
Island or notification bar LOL
isnt registering a new eSIM easier than buying and inserting a new SIM
wont the screen will be burn with that aof 
I was actually hopping for the i shape dynamic island At least in apps like youtube or camera a i shape would be a bit smaller notch
MarquesBrownlee Since they put the proximity sensor behind the screen does that mean than we cant put a protective glass on the new iPhone Pro 
Im upgrading from 11 pro to 14 pro so yes im exited 3 years to me is perfect time to upgrade Enough changes while still able to sell your old phone for decent amount
And now for the following couple generations they can just keep increasing the camera size and decrease the dynamic island size iteratively
Again showing symbolism 5 mins 28 secs Time on phone screen is 1150  Masonic  115 drop the zeros in numerology  Marques whats your game here
Hey I remember that intro song It slaps 
I think the dynamic island is a bit of a game changer because it actually makes use of the cut out or notches of previous phones
loved the review man great work had been waiting since the event for the embargo to lift
"304  Funny story I slapped the a of this girl I was dating who had a fatty while wearing my Apple Watch and it triggered the fall detection We mostly me were in tears laughing

Also those pictures are insane I dont take a TON of pictures and thus dont usually care that much about camera but those shots are legit headturning Rocks crispy af"
Huh you are biggest you tubers out there like apple in smartphone realms you should make it happen to test out is really crashed SOS work or not what you said you will wait for some others will find out how checked you just sound like apples lets others do it then i will overview come on
Wow what a big camera bump love this 
I think one thing phone reviewers should do is discuss the pricing trend on iPhones They hold their value well and theres a niche group of us that upgrade every year I do so by personally selling the last years for a higher price than apples trade in and pay a minimal difference Its a pretty smart investment if you think about it Its not really another phone but its a luxury good that retains value well
This dude is such an Apple hater anymore But you know buy my hoodies
I really love your integrity about this new phone
With a robot its quite hard or even impossible to copy 
Sadlydynamic island is only feature for Pro versionIf they made it feature on all models it would have distinguished regular 14 from 13but noand now it seems like people dont want to buy regular 14s
meh getting tired of phone innovation there isnt anything cutting edge and its kind of sad to see Steve Jobs main innovation still recycled Nothing has changed like we should have had holographic keyboard no notch siri should be more advanced AI Instead the stupid innovation is behind the scenes where it is literally a invasion of privacy gadget that gives corporations access to your most private affairs in real time A bunch of the processing power is waisted on stupid spyware Our Iphones should have been projectors by now and kill televisions but no instead we have same recycled garbage peddled with youtubers who actually get excited about tech thats been on other smart phones for years now I have had the iphone forever now and it doesnt feel like anything has changed if anything its gotten worse itunes is such a mess you have MUSIC ITUNES ITUNES STORE COME ON ALL THESE APPS COULD BE INTEGRATED INTO ONE APP  the original UI for the iphone was way more simple yet soo advanced
Marques you and your team put out the best tech content ever Keep up the great work I love to see all the stuff you come out with
IOS and the Apple watch will lock me down to Apple forever   
Does anyone know where to get that wallpaper
Its not much of a surprise anymore companys love borrowing everything new apple does nowadays You know why Cause its just smart business if you cant beat em join em
Apple watch flight of stairs workout high heart rate yeah lets stick to that story lol
"For the crash detection it should work really well Id think I had the same worry using the app Life360s paid feature for crash detection that there would be false flags if I dropped the phone or stopped suddenly but nope worked well And worked the one time something did actually happen

But Apple went through the trouble of actually being able to discern the type of crash advanced testing A lot of effort and engineering budget for an important but probably undervalued by consumers feature I respect it"
"Honestly the Dynamic Island even if it is not vital is really very well thought out and fun use a weakness pill  to make it a strength 

But it also highlights this aspect of Android manufacturers in this case LG who are very creative but never go after their ideas 

On the other hand it also highlights this aspect of Apple which always restricts new software features to new iPhones by wanting you to believe that it is related to hardware 

"
I hope you squashed that spotted lantern fly after you took its picture
"I know that apple likes to be the last to implement old features like the always on display  but
for me starts to become really anoying
what the hell apple do for a year"
the  car crash thing must be the crash thing in cars
"Seriously
Flexing the X2D Casually showing it
Ow COME ON"
When will they produce the SIM version
I really dont understand the hype around the dynamic island no pun intended They just made their widgets and notifications draw around the cutout not very revolutionary to me
Well samsung mocked it of course theyre gonna copy dynamic island
Dynamic Island is a great name 
I have no idea why people are making such a big deal about the always on display If you are really that lazy that you dont want to tap your screen really quick to see the time or something then you just have problems
That dynamic island is really overrated it essentially encourages you to smudge your front facing camera and is not onehanded friendly either
Where can i get that intro wallpaper
Sweet first review Thanks
CAN YOU DISABLE THIS FACKING ALWAYS ON DISPLAY
instead of ne it dynamic island apple  can put epal pill
loved that shot at 906 to show the island with the light
Samsung is KING 
Im pretty sure that the MKBHD editing team could make a better ad for the iPhone
Markass Brownie is back
Could you please talk next about 14 and 14 which are identically the same as 13 even the processor didnt changed and its more expensive than 13
This intro is on fire
I paused at the original iPhone wallpaper 
I think your dislike of the Dynamic Island name is more annoying than the actual name itself lmao
Couldnt they have just done this with the notch as well Its just a gimmick to sell the 14 pro simple
So you added a software feature that basically hides the notch which still exists and you are calling it an upgrade invention apple did it again yeah apple did it again apple fooled you again
1321 hahahahahahahaha
What if you drop your phone hard while driving in the car and yell and you immediately stop after That hits all the ticks for what you said
Crash detection  Pixel had this for years
waiting for s23 
Wow soMessages are stuck in the old ways The most common notification 
Folks Keep your old iPhone if you prefer swapping sim cards I would not trade it
honestly not a big fan of the dynamic island would rather prefer the small camera circle in the corner over a big pill shaped thing in the center
Its the same as the 13
Crash Detection keeps going off cause my whole life is a wreck
Xiaomi will copy dynamic island for sure
screen check camera check internals check smart phones are getting boring
Same old shirt
iPhone 14 Pro sounds cool and all but are we not going to talk about how  that intro was
Why dont you talk about the incredibly strong resale of iPhones when you talk about upgrading You keep saying its a thousand dollar thing when its often more like 200 or even less if you sell your iPhone 12 or 13 on eBay
"fk it waiting till 15
a rule of thumb i made up is to upgrade every 3 gens i went from 8 to 12pro i really wanted to get the 14 because my battery dies way too fast i have to charge it at most 25 times a day but ill just wait for the 15 and make it much more worth it of an upgrade"
"I think you are the best YouTuber in the world
from Iran"
I was fully expecting Apple to push out their version of Googles Real Tone camera improvements Kind of disappointing that they cant seem to be bothered to put significant effort into improving exposure for all skin tones
Dynamic Island will be copied but it will be called Tidal Island because it can completely hide or show Low tide or high tide 
Wallpapers link mkbhd
Hope it wont Its a stupid idea
That wallpaper at the start
That LG V10 shoutout made me laugh pretty hard Kids these days dont even know what that thing is
Whats your other YouTube I cant find it
maybe it will be copied but I honestly dont think an Android user will prefer an under screen layout over a notch eye brow pill or landing strip
Great review on the iPhone 14 dynamic island
Great intro
cinematic mode was always 30 fps they added 24 fps
Is this Verizon your using 
hats off to you for listening to J Cole 
Does it fold
Why do I have to live is Aus where shipping is 30 
Your application of the bird sounds is so much better than Doug Demuro
MATTE BLACK EVERYTHING
nice intro Thats the 3rd time Ive heard you say thats the last time youre going to say Dynamic Island
cinematic mode now supports 24fps it always did 30fps
Apple is just boring and pathetic Same as its fanbase
Wrong Its about hardware anymore Of course they will upgrade the camera because its been in need of a real bump for years But Its all about software bumps now Which lends to new products coming out soon Like glasses
Yeah ill keep my 11pro max for now
I have experienced this always on screen feature with wallpaper on and lower brightness on my pixel 3 with a bug or a glitch many times
Funny how he didnt say the island is hard to reach when he said the small lg phone was
"1324 Copied and Applified from LG V10 7 years ago  Love that
The fact is it makes the hideous notches way a little palatable"
1047 I disagree how would you quickly swap between them with a single touch 1207 as you said yourself I would find it frustrating to have to hold to quickly switch between apps when multi tasking wouldnt be so quick I think they have it the right way round
I love how much gringe he feels everytime he says Dynamic Island hahaha
So Apple says its not a notch So that means that Apple believes the sliver of real estate above the dynamic Island is usable real estate It seems like it would make more sense to push it up against the top of the phone in order to gain a bit of real estate although I guess then they wouldnt be able to market the term dynamic Island
I miss when this channel didnt sell its soul when they gave real opinions n now this channel is just a sales pitch for big companies apple
left after 140 watched plenty video without merch ads off to watch ijustine
Staying with 13 pro max
Finally he says miui rather than myui
I hope they make a mini version 
Dynamic island  MacBook touch bar
big news its already copied
"Never baught merch from anyone except from you my guy keep up the good content also 
The sweater looks fire"
Im waiting for zacks video
I think the dynamic island will end up leaving smudges on the front camera due to constant touches all day long
dynamic island 
crash detection smiles COOL FEATURE what is cool do get into a car accident and may die 
Isnt dynamic island an admission that they will not be even close to getting rid of the notch anytime soon If so 
So hes now a dynamic island Boy 
As always solid review Im also not a fan of the always on display The iPhone struggles with battery power as it is with frequent use so Ill be turning it off It seems Dynamic Island is the real selling point for this new generation and I expect it to be a mainstay from here on out Looking forward to having fun with it Hopefully theyll add a feature to customize the Dynamic Island pill in the future
"Jesus my heart just skipped a beat or two when you just dropped that phone without even hesitating 

Also there already is a thirdparty skin for Xiaomi phones that imitates the dynamic island waiting for approval in the Xiaomi store"
Where can i get that first wallpaper
There must be something that Apple does secretly to hook people to their ecosystem Each time Samsung presents a new smartphone  I switch my all stuff but then when Apple shows the new iPhone  I first pretend not to car but end up ordering it Im selling my Fold 4 watch 4 and Tab S8 Ultra and preordered the 14 pro max Is it just me
I really love what you do bro  great video 
350 did Mark really bring up an issue that only the designers and developers of the phone would care about as if it was a pro
Honestly getting tired of apple
Anyway more megapixels doesnt always means bigger sensor lol apple can squeeze 100 MP in last year sensor size if they want btw
Literal goosebumps when MKBHD gave a shoutout to LG V10 I had one and it was the most amazing part of that phone RIP V10 the phone didnt last long due to the bootloop issue
Lol 301 what are you really saying here
Tlhe pill is still too big
As always great intro
Need dynamic island in landscape mode
I feel like the GPS communication feature was nerfed in this vid That could be a legitimate reason to buy an iPhone 14
Marques breaking YouTube records out here
woah marques shilling apple products but god damn nicest YouTube merch hoodie for sure
Prices in Europe are more insane
I assumed the A16 comparisons to the A13 were Apples way of tailoring its keynotes to driving realworld user salesupgrades instead of catering solely to the techinclined Most people dont care about yearly processor changes because theyre not upgrading their phone yearly  but Apple wants to speak to those on a roughly 3year upgrade cycle hence the 2019 chip comparison
Does anyone know if the esim is limited to only network carriers in the US
For me it is the Dynamic Island and new camera that attract me to the iPhone 14 pro instead of a 13 pro A big leap from my current 11  even though the 11 is still going good
Samsung will copy that Dynamic island as they did every time when apple release the innovation
Nobody could pay me enough to switch to Apple
I know its silly but the Dynamic Island is the main reason Im switching Ive been a Samsung user since my second device 11 years to be fair Im a UI designer so the animations and functionality of it all got to me Thanks M
That dbrand plug was so casual but Im buying a dbrand case now
Expensive hoodie huh
Google should turn dynamic island into the Google search bar
what smartphone update from one year to the next is ever a huge upgrade thats worth it for most people   none ever are lol
Im switching from iPhone XR so should I get the 13pro or 14pro
That comment on the LG V10 took me back to marques dorm room
LG7 YEARS MAHN
Awesome videos sorry Im so late
Whats the real reason apple has to release a new phone every year Wouldnt we be all better off with a new product cycle every few years Or apple has to appease investors and grow capital and releases new tech accordingly So annoying
I take photos so Im super exited the iPhone 12 pro not the best
"Crash detection would have been nice 9 months ago on my 13 pro max I was hit headon by a wrong way driver both of us going 60mph at impact 
Im curious what data this feature records having the gforce and other physics info would be interesting to me 
My iPhone 13 pro max was on my seat at the time of impact and ended up against the back hatch of my Honda Element It survived the accident with no damage the Spigen case absorbed every impact "
I think they should go back to the round designs 
20192022 same fok phone Pce of
"Ah yes that time of the year when I get a million more Samsung commercials on Youtube than any other time of the year
Like clockwork"
I still love my 13 pro max wont be upgrading for another few years Same phone pretty much
JUST SAY THE ISLAND 
I have both the 11 pro and the 12 pro I really dont see a huge difference so Ill just stick with what I have for a bit longer great review btw
Thanks for the review Ive been waiting for your video the moment they announced the phone
Dynamic Island is just a marketing gimmic
Love that you rock with Hocus Pocus on the big product reviews 
Next thing they will remove the charging port instead going usb c
Altta in the intro what a throwback
1147 oooo thats interesting that black pixels works
There is a really big notch and even in the video you made and holding the phone in your hand the size of the notch bothers the eyes
This was one of the least informative and scientific analyses Ive seen on this channel Pretty thin critique
U do know Samsung kinda had the dynamic island style with their notification system Its slightly different and drops below the hole punch But OK apple
In my opinion smartphone manufacturers should not focus on 8K video Its a pretty useless feature for most users Instead they should focus more on low light performance and image stabilization
Thnx for not being biased unlike
Your review is honest I like honesty  But MrWhosetheBoss Arun Mainis video is just BIASED He sucks It looks like his video is PAID BY APPLE He just tries to somehow make Apple look better even if it is not
Tell me truth MKBHD how much did Apple pay you to spin this crap
Actually iPhone copied this from Android that punch hole
Man the things you are explaining about the phone is way too late to get excited You are the greatest puppet of apple I have ever seen
dont forget to floss marques
Im not buying another iPhone until it has a proper full screen display Not a cutout Not a massive chunk of the screen missing Theres no excuse for that hideous cutout to be in the middle of the display
I dont like the phone Worsed about it is all the people know pushing the phone It still sucks
My only issue with the island is it invites finger prints to the camera
"Oh well Apple copies some from Google
Google copies some from Apple 
Everything is a remix"
Hate the ads
Yes it would be copied but not by Samsung
Dynamic Widget id more like it This makes me want the S23 even more now This is butt ugly
I think the problem with having a car crash detection is related to gloveboxes ans suitecases What if youre just fine dont realize that this detection went off and out of nowhere a rescue brigade appears In the worst case you arent around anymore
apple controls the market somewhat its dynamic island definitely going to get copied no doubt about that lol
1813 that Apple Watch tan I feel that
S22 ultra vs Iphone 14 proWhich one is the best
I really hope other companies will copy the dynamic island its so distracting ugly anf stupid in every single way possible
I love e sim I have 3 installed     then a physical sim for  The question I have can I have 2 esims running with the esim only At the moment I run my phone with my Australian sim and whatever esim is appropriate
Google Pixel has had crash detection since the Pixel 5 However I am glad to see Apple add this feature as it will save lives
Intro footage looked a bit off guys 018 for example lots of grain Whats up
How about if your coming from a 20 is it worth upgrading to a 14 pro max
Is that a surfing board behind him  
no ones talking about flash driver by wave racer Fantastic song 603
Where is the top speaker though Is it in the bezel
You want to test the car crash function Just drive in different roller coasters with it
"Apple being so
Stupid by implementing the dynamic island that way for fingers to touch till there are finger prints smudges on the front camera everytime u want to take a selfie u have ti wipe ur front camera more"
Dont forget to floss MB
Ive been TRYING to wait for USBC That is the only thing I want The rest is already overkill for my needs I want less cables That said Ive got to upgrade at this point Still on the iPhone 7 Plus and iOS 16 isnt supported nor the new Apple watch which I also need at this point Still on Series 3   I like to keep hardware as long as possible This sets me up to have to upgrade twice if they switch to USBC next year Not happy
Anyone know whats the calendar widget on the lock screen here
Tmobile devices connect to their spacex satalight they got it before apple even thought about it  i love tmobile
that intro was SiIICCCKK
PTSD from a tough World day at 1244
Cinematic mode already supported 30 fps It supports 4K and 24 fps now those are the improvements
Front camera will always be messy
So no center stage for the selfie camera
It has honestly become useless and shitty phone for business
Dynamic island has already been copied over to a Xiaomi phone 
I have a an old 11 Its running slower and having Bluetooth issues Should I upgrade to a 14pro or should I just put up with my blue tooth disconnecting every other hour no matter what fixes I try I have tried them all and apple themselves didnt see an issue with it apparently when I took it to the apple store
Pushing 13 pro and Holding 14pro 
Can you notice the dark gab between the two sensors
one of the best most iconic YouTubers not just in tech but in general Whenever you need to watch some good YouTube high quality nice audio this is where you come
Sir is eSim more vulnerable to hacking Im not the smartest when it comes to phone internals and stuff
Shoutouts to the V10 one of my favorite LG phones Still not over them shutting down their phone line
THE INTRO WAS SICK The team is getting so damn good
I have an 11 pro max   I think Ill wait for iPhone 19  After 2 and a half years my battery is still at 80 health and lasts about 14hrs of screen time No reason to really replace  This 256g was 1300 I just dont see the benefit iPhone is an iPhone
"honestly i really like the implementation of dynamic animations
ill still wait for 15 pro until then it will be really refined"
USBC is Not a rant for another day This was the moment
Little correction 11 is not getting update
So basically they changed the size of an app to a pill shape that when u click on it does exactly what clicking on the square shaped app doesbut its a pill shape the innovation astounds me amazing
012 Bird sound while highlighting dynamic island in intro nice touch
what about taking it in your pocket on a roller coaster would that set off crash detection
why would you need 8k video right now shouldnt be at the forefront imo
I knew that Apple told gave Marques something from the new lined up products
Thank you for sustainability comments Would love to see more in the futurejust a dedicated video to sustainability of smartphone production
no 120hz
The Verge trashed the camera no major improvement over iP13P
HTCLGASUS  THE TRINITY have left us only to be seen others copying their stuff
Why was the intro so low res
If they get rid of the notch aim for a punch hole instead go for a under display and USB type c Id perhaps consider an iPhone
Dynamic Island  MacBook Touch Bar
I hate the dynamic island  dumb name they let the intern name that ugly island Of course its an islandwhat is an island In the middle of nowhere
"Dynamic Island 
AOD Implementation "
Id like to see how crash detection works when on a roller coaster or some other ride that goes fast then suddenly stops
What a freaking amazing intro wow
No physical SIM is such a deal breaker for frequent and somewhat frugal travelers
Its a neat little software trick to make something that most find ugly into something actually useful However it is sort of telling that they have no plans on ever getting an under display face ID scanner I guess the tech just wont be there for awhile
Iphones are still a thing
Dynamic island is ugly period Just apple making you wait longer and longer to have one of the simplest upgrades 
"LG

Life is good the afterlife"
Ngl the UX team carries the whole 14 series lineup in a pill while the design team just makes the camera bigger 
Itll be interesting to know what Apple did with the extra space by removing the SIM card slot in the US model
13 Mini here not tempted
not 4nm enhanced 5nm process
The camera will be usable until the next iPhone is released at which point your camera will take trash photos
The intro is fire
I wish I can afford one 
Who the hell asked for a more annoying notch Isnt the point to remove the notch all together and have a full screen bezel less display The Oneplus 7 Pro was phenomenal for that reason This is too ugly and intrusive Total flop
"apple copied LG floating bar 
worst thing is still you need both hands to operate iphone "
Again year is ending with Overpriced piece of  Happy 2022 
Self fix sponsor  apple is suing lol
847 the birdsdynamic islandnice touch lol
s10  pounch cameras centered
I renamed it to Dynamic   Lol 
Looks like touching the dynamic island with the camera sensor so close would leave marks on the screen Does it affect camera quality and face ID 
1813 Oooohhh That tan man
ROTTEN APPLE nowdayswe have made an excellent camera that can also work as a phoneit gives you a crap UI experienceif you dont buy our productsaccessories charger and worse is it will ask you to PAY UP for PRO features such as DYNAMIC ISLAND and satellite emergency services
Not gonna buy another iPhone till they add an under the screen fingerprint sensor
"MKBHD
Ok What happens if somebody would have had noticed Does that break NDA"
Appreciate your honour review Keep up the good work
"when other bring a feature after Apple  everybody  COPIED
when Apple brings a feature after Others  everybidy  LATECOMER
"
Doesnt seem like anybodys caring about the onehanded reachability that this disables
Big fan of your channel  Should I upgrade from the 12 Pro Max Ty
I dont know if you hear this a lot or enough but seeing a black tech content creator with YEARS of high level content is super refreshing Salute to you sir youre a whole legend 
I pre booked iPhone 14 pro max but sadly it got cancelled because of low stocks but luckily they have 14 pro so I immediately booked 14 pro and most probably Ill get it by 16th but now I feel that 14 pro is a better option as it is 100 cheaper and easier to use with one hand
I hope game devs utilized the island that could be really cool
that camera hub looks huge holy shit not a fan
when Samsung first released a phone with a hole punch camera they released it with wall papers that tried to hide camera but apple doing what apple does best they have finally gotten the tech years latter but improved with the software integration made it better then what Samsung did Samsung quickly tries to copy what other androids can do thats why apple will always be 1
Amazing Intro
No phone coverage is 19 EPIC
finally i  can get my cousins used iphone x for 100 i have been waiting for this release
My search completed after seeing mkbhd videos
"Thanks apple
The 14 pro 128gb price in poland is 1400 wtf"
127 I excitedly rushed off to get the logo hoodie as a gift But then I saw that you dont accept returns for sizing issues That is pretty crappy tbh given theres no way to try it on beforehand
Everyone was bashing on the notch and urged Apple to remove it and when they realized they could not remove it they made it larger by adding a gimicky feature to justifiy this move Now everyone has their mouth wide open and totally forget that they wanted the notch removed in the first place smh
Too much touching around the selfie cam
"Lg after watching this video
 gotta write up that suit "
"1M views in 4hrs 
 Wow"
Thats a nice way to advertise the to do list app lol
844 LMAO
Still rocking my XR
Its a fucking joke that the iPhone 14 still uses lighting port rather than USBC 
That intro was raw I watched it way more than I needed to Im not gonna say how many times but just know that it was a lotand it was gooood Excellent review as always 
I like your honest opinion on apple product
I think Apple removing the SIM card from their phones is a mistake
I will be keeping my iPhone 12 Pro Max for another year With the iPhone 15 it will be three years old and it still has 91 battery health right now I dont see a reason to upgrade when it runs so well with the new iOS its just a waste of money and a harm to the environment
i would 100 hate if any android manufacturer copy this dynamic island  I have some degree of trust that at least samsung is not going to copy this because at the time when UD camera is not so advanced punch hole looks the best 
As someone who regularly goes hiking deep in the Backcountry where cell service is nonexistent and injuries are very possible that satellite communication is a huge for peace of mind
I hope your knee is ok Say hi to your PT
Its crazy how far technology has come
"Me running into my room at full speed and then my mom calling out my full government name

iPhone 14 pro It looks like youve been in a car crash"
Am I the only one annoyed by the Rubiks cubes white face being adjacent to the yellow face
I agree No need to upgrade if you have an 11 or newer if anything just upgrade your battery
1201  pause
Is it worth switching from an IPhone 13 Pro Max or should I wait another year Just went 13PM a couple months ago
Did Apple test their car crash feature while testing the Apple Car 
"Others may copy LG feature Apple copied with improvement then is it copying
Island is a fancy digital lipstick on Apple notch pig"
I hate hate hate the SIM card removal I travel very often Unless I can get a European version of the 14 pro with a tray I cant practically upgrade
Intro lit 
Great review Looking at your tan line from you watch please wear sunscreen lol The sun is dangerous
love From Bangladesh 
Can you turn off dynamic island if you down want the bar to take the full top of the screen
I cant keep watching until you pick up the phone u dropped
Andrew worried about the clamps 
Here in France Prices has risen of about 200 compared to the iPhone 13
Loved the intro Nailed it 
1114 you said that twice
We have the emergency detection on Garmin bike computers If you crash or the computer detects hugh speed decrease starts to sounds an alarm and if you dont cancel it automatically starts calling emergency contacts with the location of the crash
Is there truly a difference between Space Black and last years Graphite
Thats not a Always on Display its a Always Dim Display Still no periscope lens and USB C
Kanye on Waveform confirmed
Pls the wallpaper 
The dynamic island is terrible Apple should just make a full screen phone already What a waste now we gotta wait even longer for it cause theyre gonna beat that dead horse
Wow you got alpha in 3 tries it took me 5 tries 1241
"The dynamic island 
Imagine you buy just a Pro and already have a 61 screen then you add that abomination right on top in the middle Now also imagine what happens when you are gaming or wathcing YouTube videos or reading a PDF on that thing
You gained a useless animation to lose so much usability  I sold my 13 due to the ridiculous screen size cant even think how bad that could be
Absolute BS"
Ill never understand why anyone would want an always on display on a phone Especially when we have smartwatches Doesnt make sense to me
"Got a 12 right and most definitely upgrading to the 14 Pro probably max at this point Got some screen bugs going on with my phone and the ProMotion on the Pro does a lot for me 
I do think having less going on in life no school or super hectic work does make me more susceptible to wanting the newest phone every year So hopefully after this I can hold out but USBC maybe soon Tempting"
Well this is a review
"thinks about dynamic island kinda reminds me of LGs implementation the V10 and V20
Marques mentions it in the video
I like this guy enough already "
1620 in India tho
I wont be spending 1500 euros for a phone cause it has a bouncing island thats a half price of my car
Cant wait for mine to come this Friday trading in my 12 pro max thats outta storage
You are the most biased phone content creator  its like Apple is on your payroll which I wouldnt doubt you guys want an honest review go watch mrwhostheboss  way better and fair review
Me watching from iPhone 6
Car crash detection has been on the Pixels for 2 years now
How do I add a dynamic island on my S10 using software Thats what I want now
What about the battery though
When watching your videos I accidentally hit like and never knew when l love this smartphone and i like the iphone 14 pro 
Having ifixit as a sponser for the iPhone 14 is just sweet
"Nice   
I was born on an islandcuba"
Price of the iPhone Pro Max 1Tb in your country In Australia its 2769 AUD 
Wow graphics at the intro
                 
Does anyone know if iPhone 14 pro camera have macro mode
What could they possibly do for the 15 this is definitely an s year
hasselblad x2d review please
I love the intro effects of this video Not a fan of the words on the screen with music to introduce each topic Your still amazing though and I dont consider any product unless you review
Need that wallpaper 
anyone bothered by so many fingerprints on the camera and the constantly cleaning it before you will need to take a selfie Also reaching all the way to the top to multi task Phew
No word on the US vs euro pricing
Is iPhone 14 Pro series a worthy upgrade from my iPhone 11 Pro Max  Just asking for your thoughts
"For years reviewers and people in general have been going on and on about camera notches 
Oh my god its a teardrop or a pinhole or a this or a thatI love it I hate it 
Now Apple has made it into a whole dynamic island celebration of crap People will line up to buy it"
Highkey more interested in that new chevron hoodie
Dynamic Island sounds way cooler than a cHevROn hoodie just sayin 
should i get the pro max or the pro Is the pro max too big for regular use and storage in the pocket MKBHD always uses the pro when he does demo so Im not sure which one I should get
UR THE GOAT
The eSIM is one of those pushes that is frustrating at first but makes sense to move us forward in the long run Hopefully this pushes carriers in other countries to speed up their eSIM support There should be no need to stick in a little plastic bit before your phone starts working
Why the regular iPhone 14 doesnt have the dinamic island too Nothing new on these phones looks like apple dont know that people who wants a cheaper phone want new things too
Is there anyone else who doesnt like the fact that the dynamic island is adding more UI elements to the top of the screen requiring you to reach your finger up to the most uncomfortable place on the phone or use twohandedly
Team MKBHD Another cool video But not a fan of the transitions on this one Too off brand Keep up the good work though Fan of the content
Which one will be worth Iphone 13 650 or iphone 14 1050 good decision to invest extra bucks It will be my first iphone
I actually had to get my 13 pro max screen replaced due to burn in so the always on display is a big no for me
Wow so now this phone has a camera like mine from 2019
The Apple Watch tan at 1814 is so relatable 
Ang dami mong alam Magtrabaho ka kaya sa apple para MAS gumanda ang iphone nila
I see we have a new island boy
Disgusting Island
Rip iphone
I think the satellite messaging can also be really helpful when youre walking in a forest with no service At least I can say my last words to my family when Slender Man finds me
I currently have a 12 Pro Max Great phone overall The 14 fixes whatever issue had with it I want the 120 hz and that camera would be dope
Whats the difference between dynamic island and the notification tray Genuinely not sure the hype
the fastest iphone with the slowest cable transfer speeds
can you make a review for the new airpods pro
Same intro music as iPhone X unboxing  
What an intro
"Will graduate to the front of the screen
Graduation album appears"
Tack
it will also snitch on you if youve been in a car accident and someone has been hurt other than yourself by showing that you were on your phone 3 to 7 seconds before the accident love that feature
It is time to upgrade from my first ever iPhone 7 plus to iPhone 14 Had it for almost 7 years The battery on my phone is very bad plus I wont mind a better camera Thanks for the review
I know Apple like to think theyve thought of something new but they copied Google with car crash detection  Thought you might of mentioned this as your Pixel already has it  In fact every Pixel since the Pixel 4a
i love iphone 14 pro
Who else remembered it was same intro song as it was on iPhone x  Love your videos 
How did he got an iphone before sept 16
Has there been a writing issue while scripting these videos You mentioned Z Fold 4 as Z Flip 4 in the last video You mentioned Connecting AirPods twice while enumerating the activities indicationed by the Island Not a great deal but not as crispy as your videos usually are
Can anyone confirm if the dynamic island shows WhatsApp calls as well
"You said all that stuff about accidental accident detection just to talk about the D Brand case

Thats a very committed promoter D Brand must pay you really well"
It wont get copied it already is genius
Dynamic Island is LG V20 Remastered
"I had 3 no goes for IPhones
Big notch
No type c the biggest no go
No touch ID I dont care if face ID is usefull i dont give 15k for a phone that dont have a future that even 100 phones have
Big notch fixed I will wait for the other 2"
Its weird that you didnt talk about the battery  i know its the same as 13 pro but its worth mentioning it maybe its slightly better with efficiency with 4 nanometer A16 ship or what ever
I have an iPhone 11 and honestly I dont see the reason to change to the last phone 
U also give a hindi subtitles
958 Its so friendly  approachable Never have i ever thought ill hear this said to a camera cutout
Ive been waiting for these videos Love your content I have the iPhone 13  purchased the iPhone 14 pro max in space black 
hi i love born sinner too
Id hate to be an early adopter tho Odds are the island will be 50 percent smaller next year
Thank you Markass Brownlee
"others did it first apple did it right


once again"
When I watched the Apple event I could not jump sooner on preordering the 14 Pro As a long time LG V series phone the AOD and second screen like software feature is what I was waiting for to make the jump over to apple after LG left the phone competition Reckon I shall enjoy it
shouldve called it dynamic notch lol
And all I want is a headphone jack home button long battery life and no annoying lens blisters
i was planning to upgrade but after considering some of the potential drawbacks of eSIM i canceled my preorder Will wait to see the easy of swapping between phones ive got a mini as a backup ease of use with primary carriers for getting eSIM running and staying onand if Verizion etc start adding fees every time you swap
You dont do exciting things anymore like testing the crash thing or the satellite
I give it 1 year until apple starts differentiating new vs old phones more via os like the new ones get new features and so on Just based on this video where MKBHD says that an iPhone 11 and newer will feel just as new as this one
I think the name is cute
Hmm should i keep my fold 4  or switch to iphone 14 pro max 
 Dude dynamic island is already copied from some devs and its working on Xiaomi phones flawlessly Its available in Xiaomis theme store
The song choices in this video give me early studio MKBHD Vibes Good times
The I would know got me 1805
MKBHD flexing his playlist nice 
Honestly I dont like any of the folding phones
Why is the dynamic island name so bad Genuinely wondering bc i hear everyone say how terrible it is and then Im like is it really that bad I didnt think anything of it
still no usb c
I like when these YouTubers start saying good about iPhone even though they know its shitty as hell like dinamic display
Iphone basically scamming yall n yall okay with it
I traded in my XR for an IPhone 13 pro Im going to wait to buy the newest new iPhone for a different year It just wasnt worth it this year imo
The intromusic just like for the iPhone X unboxing 
Does the dynamic Island smudge the front camera
can i say i think it would look way better if it didnt have the black pixels between the pill and the cutout
The dynamic island sits lower than the normal cut out so it is a step backwards in my eyes Not a big deal as I love Face ID but lets not pretend it is a revolution because it has a fancy animation
Iphone 15 pro will be running on Android 
oh RIP you got those lanternflies too  1554
In conclusion boring
iPhone 13 pro is now Value for money 
I laughed so hard at the dynamic island What a joke for avoiding what customers want more screen space
I love your videos every time you make a new one Im just fascinated by the production quality and the intros 
Always a cool review with the new Iphone Dig how you just do them smoothly Hope i can have one from you
Apple would probably sue you for choosing that sponsor 
just making a comment so the bots can tell me I won a prize
"Iam advocating for a full screen experience for years now and the new punchhole is worse than the old notch

The gap between the top of the punchhole and the screen has absolutely no usecase The pixels are just sitting there and using battery you cant use them in any meaningful way So they should have pushed the punchhole upwards to gain more screen realestate which would have converted the punchhole into the old notch again but apple needs something new to market right

Almost everyone was complaining about apples huge notch and the new punchhole takes away more screen realestate it sits quite low so apps like youtube need to be patched  

Its a marketing gimmick and you are losing way more than you are getting and it was apples only chance because imagine the Pros with the regular notch for most people there wouldnt be enough on the table to go for the more expensive model"
How much bigger is the sensor than the iPhone 13 lol 65 larger than the 12 lol
"No Fullscreen video demo
Was it in the pr guide not to show Fullscreen video"
Dynamic island  software gimmick to hide the hardware limitations with the notch Reused the software behind a scrollbar in macbook pro in iphone
The dynamic island kind of reminds me of the Touch Bar
Surely Huawei will copy this
Excellent review  Apple should have you present their new phones on their future announcements  Their last presentation was choppy and not easy to follow  too many presenters 
"I always see people dont mention this
One of the advantages of ESim only is that if your Phone ever got stolen they cant throw your sim card out making them very easy to find"
And here I am after one year Im watching a video about an iPhone that I will not have so soon lmfao
Where can I found that wallpaper
I wish we had more video samples of the cameras
Can we just pause and talk about the intro to this video
Wallpaper link 
Bro i guess that in order to detect a car crash the most important parameter would be if it is connected to a car carplay
"Mind blowing INTRO animation 
Great shutout for editors "
"MKBHD I thought they hint at astrophotography
Apple team Write that down write that down"
Cool Nice video
"You have some dusts in your camera sensor
Watching since 2 3 videos"
Bro you need sleep dont worry about the reviews wed understand
Crazy they went from a notch to a whole ass pill
you put island sound on dynamic island fun 
Thank you for mentioning the LG V10
wallpaper please Marquez
The dynamic island is actually stupid If you use it then you will just get a lot of finger grease over the camera
I would think a roller coaster with high G forces could possibly trigger the emergency services but if GPS is on this could be worked around in software maybe Dont even know if itd be an issue anyways
Honestly I dont care about iPhone but Im concerned about the photo with Marques and other bloggers Is he really so hobbitlike I thought he was very tall
Disagree  dynamic island will be the most copied UI animations seems clever but but there were huge complaints with Drop Down Menu Notification and App switchers being on top of the screen Literally these are 2 hand functions on large screen standard  sized now phone Your video shows that too
Always happy to see you videos These make me think What a time to be alive As always keep it up
We all appreciated the seagulls sounds as a reference to island at 014
People hate on the island but i love it
Im happy that my iPhone XS Max lasted me this far without failing on me or feeling slowish Ill finally upgrade even though the XS could probably last another year without much headache
Great Video Marques Absolutely love how you can pull out knowledge from YEARS ago just shows your dedication and how long youve been making videos Cheers bro
The intro to your video is 
i think id pay about 200 to upgrade my 13promax to the 12pro i want to downgrade to the lower weight mainly
1048 I think the reason for the tap vs the long press is the functionality they had eith the 3D touch and how it was supposed to work before they dropped it and implemented the long press for more info like Android
They are copied one plus lockscreen lol 
Its just fat
People forget that these are JUST PHONES Yall want your iPhone to basically be a computer  Glados from portal lol  Make your calls  check FB and keep it pushing 
Ive been seeing a lot of memes  Saying the iPhone 13 is just like the new iPhone 14 Just saying I wish apple didnt slow down older devices as a new one is realist would give more time to improve on newer features
One feature I want is to separate app icons on screen Insane you cant do that 
I believe iPhone 15 will be a big improvement seeing miniscule changes we have seen in 14
Yep I had and loved an LG V10 and V20 and I remember thinking to myself whenever I first saw Apples dynamic island in action wow they just straight up ripped off LGs design 
Hey anything on the wallpaper  is it stock one 
I really hope other manufacturers wont follow Apple with this eSIM only nonsense
Did mkbhd just accept on video that he broke the NDA
"Am i the only one who cant get the step counter widget on the lock screen to work It wont updateshow info 

The app itself works fine on the home screen just not the little widget on the lock screen"
I dont understand why they dont make it dimmer in the night instead of closing it One of the things I like about AOD on my Samsung is that I can see the time in the night without turning on the phone
"Me who really needs a new Phone and wants to try apple for once because my google pixel 5 is bugging like hell and has a shattered screen

Well yes this I like gotta save some money so that I can buy this when the iPhone 15 is released"
Phone 14pro  is nonsense buy iPhone  13 you are all good half of the time people only use whats app or share a tweet
Love your coverage Sort of tired with the trademark push zooms
as a kid i drew a phone with the exact same dynamic island thus and therefore i deserve at least 50 of the profit from all the iphone 14 pro sales lol
The only feature that has me truly screaming is the removebackground feature in photos I have been having so much fun with that Ive already added it to my photoshop workflow just taking photos of random objects I see
"In my opinion Apple may be late to the show sometimes but I think they tend to do everything better

Side question does anyone know if the pill disappears when we watch YouTube and movies and things like that"
Seems like a good time to upgrade my iPhone X whose battery has degraded quite a lot
Hey Marques where can I get the wallpaper Its pretty cool thx
This phone is going to SELL
No charger Apple wont be selling in  brasil
The new Pro Max is really dope sadly in Bulgaria the price is higher because of the dollar to bgn
Shout out to the Visual Affects team on the intro Goddamn
"730 Xiaomi has the best transitions to always on
Still bummed out for the 60 hz on the non pro"
Been watching MKBHD for years now and I love how how he continues to keep pushing the bar with his content GOAT Intro had my eyes gazing The watch the intro alone like 10 times
Boring same old apple products
2x crop in on the main sensor is the literal definition of digital zoom not optical  A supersampled 48mp to 12mp image utilizing the full sensor is not the same as using the center 12mp of the sensor
What I want to know is whats in the place that the rest of world have a SIM card slot
2 great new features nobody wants to test and 2 great features no one will notice
Just save your money tbh theres really no benefits for the general public to go crazy over this unless youre just trying to brag you have one or really care about the small things
the screen is it 120hz i didnt hear about that
The intro is lit
Marques low key humble bragging his Wordle solve I couldnt figure that one out knowing every letter in use 
That was painful seeing him pimp the island for half the video is he not allowed to compare the processor to the old one I mean whats the point of this video
nice to see you give props to LG every now and then
Heya What is your Calendar Lock Screen Widget
The dynamic island is a very interesting marketing move from Apple  but honestly its not worth that substantial price difference having an iPhone 13 pro max which is a virtually identical alternative
I gave my LG V10 to my mom and that phone is still going strong LG V10 and HTC One M8 were the most underrated phones imo
Is the battery is better than iPhone 13
U missed the new feature battery percentage 
Poor LG They had great phones but needed better software to compete I had the V10 and loved it
Which wallpaper is used in the video
whyyyyy does it not have USBC wtf you doing apple
Dynamic pill would sound better tbh
Hi do you people know where I can get more lock screen widgets for the iPhone
That intro was sick
Anyone else think that adding more interaction at the top of the display when screens just keep getting bigger is a bad idea Why cant companies start moving these types of things to the bottom where everyone can reach Phones are getting way too big these days I miss the sub 6 inch displays
MKBHD is tech excellence
I dont know about you but when I was watching the event I heard them say Dynamic Eyelid and i thought what a great play of words because it looks like an i and it houses the front facing camera and i thought people might call it Dynamic iLid but I was wrong 
Personally I hope smartphone manufacturers continue working towards under screen cameras instead of embracing the notchcamera holes
Whats the max number of different apps that can be in the dynamic island at once
Yo BroHis Having A Tesla Surf Board
Android vendors making full screen displays and one ui to make ui more one handed friendly Apple nahh we want u to tap way up there where front camera is to make it greecy
I love the ocean and seagulls sounds when you highlighted the pill notch The little things makes a huge difference 
soon after 3 to 4 year the water level is increase and no more island
I love you you used the pill for the iphone 14 in the intro that was so clean props to the editor 333333
LG was a pioneer of the smartphone technology
Anyone got tips on cases I dont trust any articles and I cant make up my mind 
"Invented by LG lol
Who remembers"
"Apple fanboys worshipping aesthetics more than functionalities There was a reason why screen was going bezelless in the first place and now u r going to rob that extra space for this dynamic island that is constantly present with limited function Most noobs on the internet will blindly worship apple None dares to speak critically Everyone just want to join the apple fanboy wagon Thts why u noobs r slaves to apple marketing 

Remember the first apple ad people in grey watching this massive screen with some dude giving orders Then a lady with a sledge hammer throws and break the screen freeing the people in grey from being hypnotise by tht screen guy Now u noobs hv become the people in grey Well done Go worship apple like a sucker"
I wish that Apple sets the Dynamic Island Tap to preview and Hold to open app as Marques suggests before it gets too late
Bro dropped my heart 
I am gonna miss the tiny puch hole camera form my Galaxy Note 10 Plus Under display fingerprint readers dont bother me in the slightest and display is still a Samsung W but man Im looking forward to getting My 14 Max
At 1250 you can see smudges on selfie camera
Android would have been battered by youtube if they did the same notch cutoutiphone gets a pass
First thing that comes to mind for the accidental triggers Roller coaster
I pre ordered one  ofc it would have been nicer with usb c but lightning is fine for me also i can handle that extra 20 minutes for charging or waiting a bit longer for data transfer not that big issue for me Thanks for the Great Review
PASS
 iphone
"Haha Were still getting the physical sim trey in Canada Niceee

Im wondering how many Americans will just come up to Canada to buy the iPhone here"
Just moore of the same Irlanda Large notch No Sim Card No for me
I remember the the time I would look forward to the Sept event and hear about the new phone Now its not even on the radar Dont bother watching it or WWDC anymore
I know they want get rid of the notch but at least before it blended in
Larger sensors dont gather more light because they are larger its because the photosites are bigger Exposure is perunit surface area its not a function of total surface area Thats why we can have totally black pixels next to a totally white pixel This is a common misconception that works in theory for the layman but Im nitpicking
"it already has
how is this phone actually having better camera than actual camera makers like sony and zeiss"
what a terrible name just call it a blob or something
This review feels off coming from your high standards It feels rushed I got way more info watching brian wong or the verges review in spite of you having the best visuals Kinda lackluster
Message from Andrew said Im paraphrasing oh I thought they wanted the clamp hidden in the back
Tim Cook needs to be replaced Old ppl running large companies and even our country is lousy for all under them
1730 why do people say the lightning port is so slow on google it says the lightning port can transfer at 480mbps the iphones ssd is only 600mbps so if we had usb c that could transfer at 1000mbps the ssd would limit it to 600mbps so usb c would only increase transfer speed by 200mbps
Lg has pioneered so many different fearures that we still use today that they get no credit for lol
Sick intro man seesh
Dynamic Island cool but dont forget to clean that spot before you take a self cause you know fingerprints could ruined your photo
I am already thinking of how useful this satellite feature will be once the phone is jailbroken Since the hardware is there then I am sure developers will find good use for it I would love to see free internet maybe a way to hack starlink and connect to it who knows
0309 bruh just dropped the phone like its nothing and Im here like yo watch out 
send me one of those u wont regret it
did u guys notice the easter egg in this video the word dynamic stuck on to the globe on his ryte marques brownlee
The Alwaysondisplay does not serve any purpose better feature would have been to allow call recording
I wanna know is the phone better than the iPhone 13 Pro Max  Inquiring minds wanna know
Im sure people will copy this in the same way that Apple copied it from LG And thus the cycle continues
"My oh my I feel like youre reading my mind when it comes to the Dynamic Island Every single point

Im excited to get the 14 Pro myself but its not primarily for this iPill I dont really think other companies should or need to copy this feature for example a tiny dot on Samsung galaxy S22 looks better as is than to have a giant black pill forming around it

Dynamic Island is a clever way to hide the pill and to wire peoples brain to think of the pill it as a software feature instead of a physical weird looking pill"
Dynamic island BABY 
samsung did that notch in 2019pathetic
Knew you had it all along
the use of the dyna island for that intro was choice 
I dont see why the dynamic island not coming to older phones looool Neat though
in 480p video qualiy there is green bar on top
I want the 14 pro max but part of me wants to wait for the 15 pro max hoping for in display touch ID
In a weird way the dynamic island feels like what the Touch Bar should have been
It makes me sad that new phones come out every year and especially apple become apple fanboys always must always have the new iPhone and dont care about their old phone and throw it out That will resolve in a number of ewaste
The camera test isnt done without the Red magic camera pic
Not worth it
Anybody else bothered by a UI element dynamic island encouraging smudging the front facing camera glass  Lots of blurry selfies upcoming  Im also aware that focal distance would minimize the effects of fingerprints but there will be some effect
Imagine if Apple took the brakes off and just released the best phone they could instead of dragging things out over several models
Can you test dark skinned people being over exposed  Google Pixel vs other phones
I think they compared it to the a13 so that the a15 isnt being pooped on as the standard 14 has it 
No need of changing my I phone to 14
"People need USBc best battery life new dialer alarm volume independent of system volume comfy keyboard
Apple look at the dynamic island"
The dynamic island seem like a gimmick to hide the ugly ass notch U can do all that the dynamic island can if they would have just added a drop down menu with those options that are  there on the dynamic island 
I LOLd when you mentioned the LG V10  Totally easily to forget about LGs contributions to the phone world
Here waiting for the Iphone 15 comes out so I can change my 6s to a 11pro
Can you giveaway to me never used an iPhone
I get that the dynamic island feature is useful especially to apples demographic but personally when watching movies and shows on the phone itd be a nuisance I watch a ton of media and I just want a flagship phone to pull off no notchhole punch oh well maybe in a couple of years
Apple used a Chinesemade memory chip known as YMTC Just be wary the they might pull it offshelf and refurbish it
That intro is an absolute class
Tapping to open full screen and Long Press to open widget actually makes allot of Practical sense If you hand is smaller or if youre just not holding the phone in an ideal way a quick tap is easier than a long press If youre able to long press youre probably in a more comfortable position to interact with it at the top of the phoneas opposed to the bottom of the phone if its full screen
1143 the mic indicator is on the further right
Why would they copy something that the Android manufacturers already abandoned in 2018
So what youre saying DONT UPGRADE if you have an 11 pro or newer I can agree with that 
Upgrading from my iPhone 7 super excited
wallpaper link 
Do you recommend that 1000 trade in deal from the phone companies 
Warning   Dont spend more than 200  on phone
He forgot to talk about the adaptive flash
gonna stick with my 13 pro max dynamic island is really the only difference
Year by year Apple do nothing to upgrade bigger specification Really sad but the truth is heartbroken
So you too start a wordle with AUDIO
"This is why I dont like MKBHD anymore Hes an apple bot He has said the island is a great thing Its just an animation Wtf is he talking about
Who gives a f About new chips nowadays basically nobody uses it to its max capacity"
"That intro
Felt like nothing was an inspiration"
Great intro Keep it up Marques and Team
esim is the dewth of me
Feels good that you mentioned LG V10 because that second screen was the first thing that came to my mind when the Island was mentioned in the impressions video
Terrible terrible Notch pathetic way to hide your flaws now a days companies r trying to hide even smaller of front camera circle but apple is still giving pathetic notches to its newer generation iPhones dynamic island seems good feature but no way it looks pretty apple really needs to up its game when it comes to screen appearances 100 budget phones have smaller round shape notches now days
IOS16 is giving worse battery life tbh
Old intro 
"MKBHD dont self snitch bro

Apple watching like oh so you basically broke the NDA"
I think the pill sized problem with the dynamic island is that the ease of interacting with the island is low because of its location Its basically required to use your other hand to touch the island
Always on display is not supposed to be bright Its supposed to give people the chance at night that if they quickly want to look over their phone they can see the time and messages etc
Is anyone else reminded of the kid riding tricycle when he was chasing the dog
I think I know why because its your black
"I really like the dynamic island

They merge hardware parts with software in a beautiful way "
"Thats Different 

"
Cool so I have to teach the top of my phone constantly  Everybody loves having to touch THE TOP of their phone for basic functionality
Hows the weight though Heavy How is the balance
323 you just unintentionally confirmed that Apple is listening to you 247 
"I could be wrong but Im struggling to see why other manufacturers would copy the Dynamic Island feature The notch is uniquely an Apple issue these days and this is their solution to alleviate the issue until theyre in a position to remove the notch all together Ie Id be very surprised if they decide to keep a permanent black bar at the top of their screen when they finally release a notchless full screen iPhone

Every other manufacturer has migrated to the pinhole solution which is nowhere near the same eye sore issue as a notch so the need to alleviate it just isnt there All theyd be doing is taking up more unnecessary screen space for no additional benefit Unless of course they all decide to take a step backwards and reintroduce the abysmal notch for some reason You can tell I really do not like notches"
You cant beat Marques The edits and shots are beautiful Hes low key a cinematographer FANTASTIC
That intro was 
MKBHd is the pinnacle of reviews
Does the 13 pro max case fit the 14 pro max case I want to upgrade but I dont want to buy another case again
Bring back the old Apple days 
Its the same FIFA since 2019
I have a 12 mini and while I like it Ive been wanting a larger display and better battery life again I think its probably something I should just hold off on but here I am seeing Oh I can trade my phone in get some back while its still worth something and go all out with the latest and greatest
1603 youre new teammate is dope
Theyll add 8k and usbC to their pro model next year That will be the selling point for it
One thing id be really worried about is smudging the hell out of the front camera with the dynamic island
Decent video maker 
Love my iPhone but Pixel users received crash detection nearly 3 years ago It actually activated and helped me out Amazing feature now in iOS Respect for the LG v10 shout out I loved the feature
They already copied it 
By your review I realize that we should wait for iPhone 15 pro it doesnt worth to upgrade from iPhone 13 pro to 14 pro  Every year I upgrade my iPhone but this year I think I should wait for the next iPhone 
At first I thought MKBHD finally drops the ball or frisbee with the Intro then I realised nothing is ever random with this guy This is a nudge to Apple showing us how they do their videos for the very first time
low key showing us hes good at Wordle and got yesterdays word in 3 pfff
nice just in time
What happened to iphone 11 12  13  Not evsn used 11yet Oh God send sweet phone my way
 This is It
Howd you get that calendar in the Lock Screen
Intro song please
Hey does your tesla wirelessly charge your iphone with a case on I was having that issue bc the camera bumps are huge
Why not just move the pill to all the way up Much cleaner
Apple again forgot to bring in display fingerprint scanner 
Upgrade time Im on 10s Max
I think its colossally greedy not to include always on display for iOS 16 on devices that can clearly handle it
3rd party apps have already copied dynamic island on android
That wallpaper please
Mentioning LG v10 good one
Regarding the astrophotography mode right now you can place iPhone on the tripod and night mode shutter time automatically goes up to 30s I dont think Ive seen it before the iOS 16
The edits BGM and the humour keeps improving each time Makes it totally worth to wait for your review
Its a no from me dawg
"Ofcourse it will be copied Its just software nothing truly innovative
And to think this is the main feature of the 14 Pro"
With the iPhone in the US going full esim in the USA I feel like people are going to start buying iPhones from other markets say like here in Canada
I dont know if this feeling is related to my antiApple sense but I think that the always on display on Samsung devices are way better and have more charisma I will even not mention the island think as even Apple fan boys would be complaining about it soon
Well like apple 33 of this video is also about cameras
Dynamic island kinda makes sense for iphone coz their notif center sucks  compared to samsung and other androids They used this instead improving notif center
If you reading this I wish you a day filled with kind people lots of smiles and unexpected blessings God Bless you and Loved ones
The only accidental trigger I can think of for crash detection would maybe be on a roller coaster
I have a cool way to test the car crash Strap the iPhone to a rc car with a ducktape and crash the car into a wall
Only I love stevejobs I love apple  but u really good awesome men I like it pro 
Is it the same case like last yearwill pro Rez video be supported only on the 256gb Variant or we straight away go with 128gb if the new 128gb variant supports
My thought is well see 34 years of dynamic island until they change the design again It seems like a good upgrade to me
anyone else not getting the ios16 update notification Have a 13 pro max and it says up to date
Ditched my 13 pro for a Fold 4 and I wasnt sure if Id regret it after the 14 pro was announced I dont regret it one bit
Dump iPhone into dustbin
Was going to upgrade but cant get around the fact that it doesnt have a physical SIM and the retarded Dynamic Island BS thats just plain intrusive and an eye sore   LMAONo way other Manufacturers are going to copy it when most have tried to minimize the front facing camera notch more successfully than Apple  Wonder how much Apple has paid Influencers to promote the Dynamic Island Turd
Im currently running an iPhone 7  cant wait to upgrade to this bad boy Looks sick
now the frontfacing camera will be in fingertip marks because that island
Satellite feature is there to in huawei mate 50 pro
Being an android user It feels soo addictive 
Im interested to see how the crash detection works I have a pop socket on my 11 Pro Max and I like to spin my phone on the Pop Socket Sometimes when I do this it turns on driving mode because it thinks my phone is in a car because I spin it at the correct speed I guess
1424 its 13 Pro not 12 Pro
nah im fine with my iphone 13 mini anything small with great specs will do 
So just like the old days its basically a 13S pro
I had a nightmare of a group fight where I thought you were trying to shoot at me with a real gun but it was a kids BB gun and I didnt know and I managed to kill you with a real gun in response And then I felt sick and heartbroken and the tech community wanted to murder me in return  I was glad to wake up from it
Im curious if roller coasters will trigger crash detection Also maybe someone from the air force can test that too 
That was such a boss intro I literally went back to watch it again And the seagull sfx for the dynamic island  perfection 
1818 my reaction when I heard the name  Dynamic Island
"Apple is running out of ideas dynamic island Lmao 
Why not include an SD card slot so people can take advantage of those cameras"
Great review and you have a new subscriber    question  my iPhone 12 Pro Max does not take a good photo of the moon  its comes out blurred and not what the naked eye sees and with a lens cover over the camera lens it gets starlight effect not good  so can you please test it for me and let me know your results  Im very tempted to buy one 
Can you give me one iPhone 14pro 
"So in a nutshell if you buy an iPhone 14 pro you will have black pixel all the time by default
Nice Apple This is ridiculous"
That intro was AWESOME excellent video man  as always 
"No one 
Apple Lets put a touch point over the camera"
1503 
boring
When the seagulls started to play I started looking outside my window to see where they were lol
1300 so you assume touch detection is associated with the OLED I always thought the the touch circuit is on the glass not on the OLED so it can register touch on the dead zone
I love this the iPhone 14 series is the bomb I love it I must say that iPhones are the best phones in the world and also Apple is the best brand in the world
Came for the IPhone STAYED FOR THE HOODIE
"Muy buen revisado con muy buenos consejos  
Es curioso que el precio del iPhone 14 en USA sea el mismo que el precio del iPhone 13 del ao pasado o eso he entendido y en el resto del mundo haya subido muchsimo su precio Creo que dentro de esa jugada est lo de llevar ranura para SIM o no Seguro que habr ciudadanos de Estados Unidos que prefieran el iPhone con ranura para tarjeta pero tendrn que pagar ms por l al tener que comprarlo fuera al igual que habr ciudadanos de otros pases que no les importe la ranura para SIM y aprovechen para comprarlo ms barato en un viaje a USA No parece para nada casual por parte de apple la jugada de eliminar la ranura para la SIM slo en USA"
"Intro was sick 
Love it"
833 Hilarious The Dynamic island is just apple trolling all the leakers The leakers were right its an i but apple disabled the pixels between the 2 holes John Prosner was 100 on the money
Always on display btesrof ktir battery
It will be copied on Xiamis next software update
If that chevron hoodie had blue instead of red Id buy it immediately
Lol Ill stick to my 13 pro max graphite Not enough upgrades for my taste Still cant believe they made micro measurements so that you have to upgrade to use cases Sad sad sad but effective lol greed runs the world
Did he say something about the battery or did I miss it
Mkbhd is the biggest apple fanboy ever if you want more subjective review Mrwhostheboss is the go to guy
Yo Marques forgot to talk about the battery Later edit
YAY Now iphone can help you with satelite if you are lost on island
I havent seen the rest of the video yet but holy that intro was so good
A already have dynamic island early access on my android phone It only showed up for charging indicator and Bluetooth connection
Its mad how LG did Everything first lmao
Can someone help me  where i can get the wallpaper
the ISLAND is just UGLYYYY
For crash detection I thought about would a rollercoaster cause a false positive
1143 nice
Hey Marques i hope all is well just a thought about the Dynamic Island do you not think that it is like all smart phones the way that it allows you to switch from background running apps Like all they have done is made it a tappable icon instead of a long slide up to see the background apps Just a thought on it And I an not exactly a fan of it but I would not mind it If future phone companys decide to follow with the camera notch turning into some sort of QUICK APP ACCESS then I believe they all just moving the already usable long swipe up to see background apps that do not bother the users view of the screen to something that will be in your way most of the time
"Other phones clean your camera lense for a better shot

Apple put your finger on the lense in the name of apple way"
"343 WHAT ARE THOSE My man is wearing Crocs in the MKBHD Studio  
404 Marques thinks that Apple impends to expand the eSIM"
1022 hey marques you forgot to clean off a smudge off your lens on the bottom right side
I hope no company takes a step backwards and implement something stupid as this floating bar
"Does it have the noise cancellation 
Or apple has said goodbye to it for forever"
How much will all the new haptic features effect battery life
I would honestly prefer a larger top bezel with the speaker and camera than this floating island thing
Coolest intros on YouTube period
The beginning is the video is kinda funny MK here claiming only the internals the display and the camera are different lol thats pretty much a new phone right there he couldve said  it looks the same from outside but its a completely different iphone 
Welcome our new feature  Fingerprints all over your frontfacing camerasponsored by Dynamic Island 
I like your transperancy and honesty I like my take part
no type c and fast charging 
Used iPhone sales are going to take a dive with that esim
The only reason i love iPhone 14 pro is the form factor 61 just is right 
Great 3
Apple will create virtual SIM numbers pay per day subscription Remember I called it 1st
always on display should show as home and lock screen i think
Good a
I dont even know at this point how iPhone users arent offended apple literally is making fun of them seeing what they can get away withhow could  you bring back the same exact design after a whole year from a company that was sued for slowing down older phone so u would buy the new one if its one thing in life I would never understand is the apple loyalists
God bless
"Of course it gets a grand intro

Its an iphone isnt it "
"If you cant get rid of it embrace it 
 Apple"
So they mean it No more Minis huh
The Notch was a smart move from Apple It is so cool that many probably want to copy it but now that every smartphone has killed the notch it would be a step back for all of them Its only a step forward for Apple They had the biggest notch for the longest time
"Silly bigger phones and make user interact with things at the top of a phone super silly They already realised that putting search bars etc at the bottom was smart move and now again away from that method

does it have potential future interesting ways to do with things but just at the moment force extra aspect for devs to build and tests

Semms flashy and sell for user maybe as a differentiator but doubt its anything good unless they implement and force across userbase 
if i was a dev now and had to hurry to build something and someone throws you need to make dynamic island bs  im like really for the pro users only atm last thing on the priority list"
1250 You can already see fingerprints all over the area above the frontfacing camera I think its a useless gimmick like the TouchBar No thanks
Great a
God bless you
Battery
Sad when your hoodie is more interesting than the phone
Mentioning new camera size in MP and not in the chip sizecome on MKBHD  1128 is comparable with Huawei P40 Pro series and bigger than S21S22 Ultra 1133
if i have an 11 pro max is it worth upgrading to a 13 pro max or 14 pro max i dont feel fully convinced by the 14 pro max especially with less battery life than a 13 pro max and the removal of the SIM tray
I just want the notch and punch hole cameras trend to go away I miss screens being uninterrupted
Hey quick question  did you floss after doing the review Thanks
The dynamic island is JOBS level Apple has been so stale lately but wow this is genius
A million in under 4 hrs easy
why does no one talk about how iPhone only keeps that high brightness outside for about 1030 mins before reverting to the brightness of a iPhone 1 seriously the phone is horrible got rid of my 13 because of it fk apple
as an experience designer the dynamic island that name  lol is a great quality of life update  they kinda gave up covering that hole haha
My concern about ESimis what if I need to send in my new phone for repair and I want to use an old iPhone for a week or two  How will that work
I will be reviewing it soon 
Dynamic island way better than that ugly disgusting notch Its the only reason to buy an iPhone because that pathetic notch is gone forever
"You got yesterdays wordle in 3 attempts  Nice

Took me 4 attempts "
Yep good evolutionary update  Sticking with my iPhone 11 Pro with a fresh battery for another 23 years hopefully
dynamic sausage
Ugly shit  Apple is basically selling the same phone every year now  And everybody buy it like its the messiah of phones
Apple gave me 720 for my 13 pro  For 400 new phone 14 pro I think is good
Bro why does the intro look so pixelated even on 4k 
Apple Dynamic Island LG 2015 wants its invention back
Good review but honestly the new iPhone is as boring as the last years iPhone
Im still using an iPhone6s which i bought in 2016 I think its worth an upgrade for people like me who are using old phones They are going to stop ios updates to iPhone6s from ios16 so now im thinking to cop me a 14pro model
Dam I remember watching ya videos way before u had millions of subs  proud of you man
Ill keep my 13 pro max then especially for what I use it for Love the new screen but that doesnt warrant the price tag for me
My Apple Watch did something hilarious once I was at work and this hot guy came in to chat with my coworker He was there for a few minutes After he left my watch buzzed so I looked to see what it wanted I saw Are you finished working out Haha apparently my heart rate was up or something while the guy was in the room I was sitting in my chair the whole time
Thinking of switching to the dark side Yes Im Android fan and thinking of getting the iPhone 14 pro My Pixel 6 isnt doing anything for me Buggy and really bad fingerprint sensor for starters
iPhone 13S
Dynamic Island is such a sick name tbh I wasnt too sold on it when I first saw it but the name was very on point Great review
Stop trying to get phones to fold in half Literally noone rounded is asking for it
Love the old style intro
They are trying so hard to get rid of all external buttons but they keep the silent onoff the one switch we all turned off 10 years ago
90 hz
Why the battery is decreased in compared with 13 Pro Max
Getting an international eSim is incredibly easy although at the moment its slightly more expensive But it means you can use a websiteapp to instantly get an eSim for wherever you are The new iPhone can take up to 8 eSims at once
iPhone 14 Pro still has a lightning port You all just lost the game
technically everthing is gonna be tested by other youtubers
This intro will be copied too Its amazing
Im not an Apple fanboy But every other phone manufacturer will copy this its game changing
Dynamic island was already on the LG V10 and V20 years ago Apple like to play catch up and scream its all new
All I see with the dynamic island is a front camera thats going to be filthy
that intro 
The Far out teaser made me think theyll show a Galaxy phone
Hoodie season It got as shit here
Starting to feel like MKBHD is leaning towards Iphone a little more in his reviews Knick picking in Android phones yet glorifying small features in IOS And before I get attacked I have both a Pixel 6 PRO and an Iphone 13 Pro Dont think so Just go back to reviews he did for both pixel and Iphone  like 3 years back and compare it to his reviews last year
Just another new thing I cant afford
Nice dynamic island on the globe behind you
Try  a solid  Black wallpaper and see how the Aod looks after that
You better tell me if its still overheating and dimming down in the sun before I spend my 2000 Breaking edge technology but can out manage heat like what the
So the dynamic island is basically glorified LG V20 second screen
Show us your bumble
Nothing new expect increase price tag
So basically all Apple did is turn down the brightness of the Lock screen and call it AOD SMH That literally defeats the purpose of an AOD plus hurts battery life and eventually the display as well
1500 I thought I saw a floating head
But how does the iPhone 14 Pro camera compare with the iPhone 13 Pro though
"I really hope that this wont be copied 

Notches punchholes and all of that stuff should just stay gone for good once the technology side is advances enough For me this is nothing more than a gimmik to make it look like its no wasted space Im still using my trusted Oneplus 7 Pro until we get another phone without one of those annoying punchholes People like me might be in the minority here but I wouldnt even miss a selfie camera if they just left it outright because Im never using it"
"Marq  I think this is the apple wayits awesome
Also Marq  I dont really care yk"
Why cant Apple make dynamic island for Iphone 1312  I know its not a pill type notch but I think it is possible
Hey Marques I currently own an iPhone 11 which I bought a year ago Im not one to upgrade frequently but I do like to take pictures Would you recommend the new iPhone 14 or 14 Pro or any of the older iPhone models
if they want the same features can be done with the current notch so what so good about it
This can become the most viewed Mobile Review video ever
"Correct me if im wrong but i thought Cinematic mode was already 30fps when it was introduced with the iphone 13 pro

The new cinematic mode now supports 24fps Which im happy about "
What is your other channel
I guess Im still keeping my xs max
I would have liked to see always on display show charging or battery life I dont care to see my wallpaper faded Or just clock and date like android
"For iPhone I would go Pro for the OLED display which is why I moved to the iPhone 11 Pro  Nice to be able to see the screen when I am out walking around and in sunlight

When it comes to eSIM I am going to have to check with my carrier to see how this would work for me if I need to move to a backup iPhone  A few years back I dropped and killed my iPhone to a point it would not power up  I was lucky in that I still had my previous iPhone so all I did was pop out the SIM and move it to my old iPhone and I was back up and running until I could get my newer iPhone repaired  Need to see how hard this is going to be if I have a new iPhone that only supports eSIM  Is there a KISS way to move my phone numbereSIM to a backup iPhone

After some review it is looking like I may be moving away from the iPhone product line if I can not purchase one with a SIM card tray  Looking like no easy way to move from device to another device should it die  This is a deal breaker  At least I am going to get a USB type C port

For now sticking with my iPhone 11 Pro with A13 1549 GFLOPS supercomputer in my pocket until Apple comes out with an iPhone that has SIM tray and a USB Type C connector that I hope is either USB4 40 or USB4 80"
I actually love the name
So is it worth the upgrade compared to the 13 pro
   apple 
W
Like this video well done marquis great demonstration of whatever the 14  is 
1821 my mouth started watering
Yeah everything will be copied like notch OLED AOD notification drawer you know
that intro animation was amazing
I hope your knee feels better Marques
Whats the widgets he has on the Lock Screen
no charger and still no shout from any big YouTube as it is a big deal breaker for soo many people
So Im covered if Putin starts WW3 LOL Satellites will still make my call for me to tell everyone Im a Zombie now haha
Did you forget to rotoscope out the metal bar holding the phone at 024
My man forgot about the battery
I think what will make the always on display better than others in once Live Activities begin to roll out Being able to see a sports score or something without even having to wake my phone will be great
Im happy with no island or any other holes in my screen
Great video will be upgrading from iPhone 11 to the 14 pro Unfortunately in Sweden the price was bumped almost 300 RIP
does this new notch feather would expand the lifetime of the notch in the phones I mean Samsung and others wont switch to the camera under display because they will try notch in the apple way
Good review overall but im surprised you didnt acknowledge that the battery performs better after some use because of softwaremachine learning so to say the always on display is slightly draining after using it for a week compared to your 1 year old 13 Pro isnt really accurate
Dont get me wrong im switching from my note 10 to iphone 14 pro But if apple keeps pulling this off and slacking people will notice and it will be the next nokiablackberry
Honestly im just gonna wait for the iPhone 15 I assume theyll adjust the errors here and improve next year i have the 11 pro max 256gb and still works perfectly still fast  still has perfect battery So i honestly dont see the convincing reason as to why i should 1299 to upgrade to the 14 No sim tray is the biggest negative for me i travel alot and change sims nearly every time I go somewhere so yeah ill pass
Aaaa iPhone and iOS is for dudes after 60yrs but now stick to Android boys Let the girls have them
2 Easter Eggs on the Right of Marques
Apple will now introduce an thumb extender to just reach the notch and that will be billion dollar company like airpod pro
"That iphone drop with dbrand case
Smart move"
your merch is the only merch in the whole of the youtube world i would definitely buy love it
Soon we can this dynamic island in Android too
308 that was unbelievably fluent
Cant wait til i get mine
Next is a Smaller Notch  then pinpoint then underdisplay camera all for Your Money 
"I need help
How can transfer WhatsApp chatting from android phone to iPhone"
I think dynamic notch is a better name than dynamic Island
If only they had the iPhone 14 in Fall 
1816 The detail in Macs photo
Whats the song playing at 527
Wooo 20syl track as intro is so damn cool
"The iNotch 
The Dynamic Island 
What a weird name choice by apple lmao"
Am i the only one who thinks dinamic island notch looks ugly as f
So my question for MKBHD is Did you have flossing your teeth on your calendar or are you doing a video or interview with Flossy Carter LOL
Its named perfectly iLand
"Apple made notch interesting in really good way
They came late but used it better "
MK I love how you used a different version of the same intro song you used for the original iPhone X unboxing such a great throwback
The wide camera is somehow worse than 13 pro max a smaller aperture
With the eSIM I find one big plus and one big minus The plus is that if youre phone is stolen you can track it all the time The minus about travelling abroad
I cant believe all these fancy animations of the dynamic island actually made me forget that Android already indicates when Spotify is playing or you have an ongoing timer
That intro hits hard 
Battery backup is next level 
The Dynamic Island is just a tipsy work around by Apple but eh at least it has a charm I guesse
I thought you were never gonna say dynamic island  please drop that term
Small changes for a big price Interesting to see sales numebers
Dynamic Island reminds me of the MacBook touchbar or LG second screen Its an aesthetic and it wouldnt be there if it wasnt for the cutout for face id This may be helpful on iOS but Android already does this at a system level without needing a dynamic island Apple is so great at marketing though Who else can make a hardware defect seem like a feature I use both OSs btw
Damn that intro with that unapologetic phone stand My first intro of yours was the iPhone 11 Pro til this one
For the average iPhone user this is basically a 5 noticeable difference from the 13 Pro  laziness Hard pass
Ok that intro was  Well done
Loved your review Made me decide that I dont need the 14 pro Im gonna buy the 13 pro for a cheaper rate
As usual  a great review note on the side liked the  floss  in the to do list 
So since it only supports Esim I cant use it in another country that doesnt have Esim And when you buy from ATT youre only locked with them
Im bigger fan of your videography and editing skills than the products Just amazing
"The notch is awful The dinamic island is stupid Is the same notification but infront the camera The front camera will be dirty all the time for all that touching No battery on the box on a 1000 phone Still no fingerprint What about users that dont like face recognition

Apple is a disaster this days Kind of like Disney"
He needs to add a hairline to his collection
He couldnt do the i phone 14 as we expected the leaks to have a i shaped cutout But still dope af 
They removed chargers because of environmental considerations But why not change the charging port to USBC
Nobody asked for that dynamic island
Yeah Marcus what else can trick an apple watch to think that you are having a workout hmm
That dynamic island is just a copy of the secondary display from LG if we are being honest with ourselves
Dam that intro was lit
Does it have split screen multitasking
Idk if I didnt get his joke but cinematic mode has always been 30fps And 30fps only
The whole dynamic island feature couldve still worked with the notch you cant say the island isnt just a notch moved a few centimeters lower It was a very smart marketing ploy to make the phones feel newer despite no actual hardware innovation  You can really tell they wanted to stick to the 3 year redesign cycle but couldnt get the tech right for an under screen camera just yet Hopefully theyll find out the best way to get the camera below the screen as well as USBC in the coming years
Im getting a new iPhone 13 pro max so I can get rid of my 30 min battery life iPhone 7
Couple of days back i saw this new movie called Fall I was thinking what it they had an iphone 14 right now
"The thing is the island is really software driven its not hardware  I mean Apple just dont seem innovative anymore just pushing the same thing with minor updates or going backwards like the macbook designs  Fine they make more money but being innovators Im struggling  I mean this was a clear message going all th way back to iPhone 11 dont bother upgrading

Wonder what jobs would say"
Giving me old WebOS vibes too Not sure if they did anything similar but they had that pill concept This is just reimagined with active tasks
Tasks Floss lol
its like always apple does what everyone did lately but much better apple always wins
"The best camera system i have seen on the back is of the Vivo x70 pro plus
50mp OIS with laser AF
8mp OIS with 5x periscope optical zoom
12mp OIS with 2x Portrait optical zoom
48mp GIMBAL OIS with ultrawide 06x 
Carl zeiss T coating with no glare and lens flares"
Would love to see how this competes with mi 12s ultra cause that cam was quite good too ig
For those of you wondering the calendar dot widget on the lockscreen is one of the new ones from TickTick
1 urgently needed innovation has to be intellegent AIapps that frequently remind us about how much screen time that we have spent interupt us when were doing the mindless scrolling in social media or hoping from 1 Youtube video to another
You certainly take the fun out of reviewing apple products
What are those dots on the lock screen Which app widget was that
Nobody does it like MKBHD when it comes to reviews
They made the horrible notch even WORSE  always on display is pointless Car crash satellite stuff decent but not even worth mentioning Widgets are still an undercooked gimmick just to say they have them IOS has not had meaningful updates in generations Apple has been stagnant for years Keeping my aging Iphone until they have either design something worth buying or drop the launch prices to realistic levels for what theyre actually selling
Is there anyway to turn on the black pixels that are turned off in between the sensor and the camera
Nice way to tell us the clamp in the intro was intentional 
If we were to have esim only we should have gotten an sd card slot
AOD not actually turning the oled mostly off is weird seems like a worse implementation than android
Lightning port cough
Give me usbc apple I can see lighting port disappear on the next iPhone
The dynamic island baby tries to make is sound cool but immediately heard himself say it what a terrible name haha
528 who else thought it was an ad 
do you think the iphone 15 will get typec port
Waiting for my golden 128 GB one 
Good explain Thanks bro
kudos to the intro
Will it be a wise decision to upgrade from iphone xr to iphone 14 pro  pro max
The island is Apples next big reason to market a special microfiber wiper for the iphone 14 pro selfie camera 
The accidental crash detection trigger that Im actually very worried about is roller coasters As someone who travels around the world to theme parks Ive noticed apps like Life360 that have crash detection consider some roller coasters crashes Its gotten to the point where it would trigger on a ride and call emergency services because I wasnt able to respond to it immediately I hope that this is not the case on the new crash detection on these phones
1047 i was thinking the exact same thing right before you said it Tap should bring up the widget and long press should go to the app
i dont think dynamic island is a good one  they just basically make notification blend in with the hole punch which making the pill even bigger than the notch which iphone try to get away from first place  like its literally bigger than the notch when theres notification  and Android hole punch dont have to follow this stupid idea after all apple pill is too big thats why its make sense to do it  android punch hole is tiny  you can do what  also you have to reach your finger all the way up top to tap on that dynamic island  no thanks
and they should probably shift to USBC Haha love it
The intro
All I want is USBC 32 20Gbs port 
thank you for reminding me to do my Wordle
These intros are just getting better and better
"What about phone calls how do they sound 
And what about 5G speeds I heard 14 gets higher speeds than 13 coz it supports more bands"
what if Samsung put a mic in spen and we can use it remotely like we do for videocamera recording
Cant say about the upgrade on iPhone but your videos and edits are definitely getting lot better
Does the always on display will make the oled lifespan shorter
upgrading from the XS to the 14 pro and its getting delivered this friday finally  My XS is bumming out at this point i o and u on my keyboard dont work and nitehr does 7 8 or 9 i cant even text people without siri and i constantly add random snapchats to my story because my screen ghost taps 
Dutlniv tioogattlyg
Should I get the newest Galaxy or get the 14 pro max  Currently have Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G
thats a huge dynamic island xD
So basically apple is now selling software improvements as a different phone
Shout out to everyone who hurried here to watch new tech but not buying any 
What if you drop your phone out the window on the freeway
U said connecting AirPods twice when talking dynamic island lol
Waiting for ur review bro
"This will be copied






By Apple for the next 5 years to come"
Wow always on display like android have had for years ffs
Wait iPhone 13 Pro do fit on iPhone 14 pro cases I saw someone said it didnt 
Best intro music ever
The dynamic island is stupid wouldnt it make more sense to put something like this in a easier to reach spot People will hype anything
Apple is getting closer and closer to Android 
Thank you for an excellent review as always  Do you agree that I should hold off for another year  I have the 12pro and I honestly dont see anything that excites me with this release
Apple you might fall or crash or get lost solets us track your location by satellites
man that intro that was on some next level you can add the screen in post and remove the camera reflection though
The entry is Epic
I really dont like the youtuber approach to iphone reviews where they assume we all have the new iphone from last year already lol
Apple stopped innovating YEARS ago  Still pushing out the same products year after year   Its up to the general public to stop buying their crapwhich will never happen and push them to innovate something exciting
Marques please make a battery life test for iPhone 14 Pro Max thanks in advance
APPLE should make more Mini iphones
Linus might want to take some notes on his Sponsor segue
Im interested in Nexus 6p like rear camera bumps resembling the front dynamic island
Damnit I had not done todays WORDLEthanks Marques 
I wait for iPhone 16
"i have the 13 pro max right now and i love it however the 14s new island and camera are temptingBUT if apple sticks with the eSIM for the US market i doubt Im going to upgrade and just wait until later on until my 13 dies i could by a UK model if i wanted but i dont feel like dealing with the plug issues 

the eSIM is big negative for more because i travel internationally at least 2 times a year and many of the countries i visit dont use phones with no sim trays since they are prepaid sim usage on the sim itself My phone works internationally with wifi but for spots that need service i need the card tray so the 14 is pass for me"
Real question how annoying are all the fingerprints on the selfie camera from all the times you touch it when interacting with the island
Thanks  appreciate how both comprehensive and accessible your reviews are Impressed wproduction quality Peace
Caption should have been IPhone 14 Pro This is Copied
Best YouTuber out there
That cutout looks annoying I hope android continues their quest for all screen Thats the dream
I love how you used a remixed version of the same music you used in your iPhone X unboxing video intro Keep up the good work
I dont like the always on display either It makes me feel like Im gonna think my screen is on from a notification rather than an idle state I wish it was pitch black with just the clock and the widgets dimly lit like on android phones Ill be turning it off when my 14 pro arrives
Back in the days they would have called that an iPhone 13 or S
Dont other phones have way better zoom on smartphone cameras My iPhone 13 pro max still is very blurry when I zoom in on my camera
Bro is mentioning that you had a prereleased model a violation of your NDA Maybe delete this video and reupload without that part I want to keep seeing stuff from you
I love your videos man Cheers
019  0527 To me Apples Extremely exciting most beautiful pop ups invention
why are they increasing CPU performance over battery life longitivity cos of Camera cos of featuers i dont get it
I think Techrax will test the crash test first 
What about the battery difference between the Pro  the Pro Max unless the Pro Max will have its own review video
LG V10 nvm people dont care
Cant wait to get mine Favorite features Dynamic Island improved front facing and rear cameras always on and the deeper black
Is the sim blocked only for US
1114 gah damn MKBHD hook me up
wonder why noone has thought about this before such a small little feat to the punchhole
Yah  hopefully android phones will leave the whole dynamic island shit alone 
Wont the Dynamic Island just get fingerprints and smudges all over the front camera tho
XIAOMI already copied
Graduation i gotta listen to this album againone of the best from Kanye
One of the test that should be done for the new crash detection system is getting on a roller coaster and keeping the phone in your pocket
Do NOT say nonperfect conditions while showing us pictures taken of a dog
So here is my experience its the esim Its really easy and simple to purchase one and set it up I did it with Mint Mobile when I switched over Here is the one big issue I see with esim if you break your phone like I did to the point where your screen does not work you are stuck You cant get temporary codes send to your number you cant easily move the sim to another phone and if you forgot a password again you have no account recovery number to text because your number is locked to an esim that is locked inside a phone that doesnt work So aside from this particular set of circumstances I think esim s pretty convenient
Oh Dudeyour Tesla  As always love your videos and this time apple has upped their feature list once again 
"Lg is so innovative but there advertisement sucks
Using Lg g7 from 2018 and its still destroys most of the uper mid range phones of 2022"
Im an iPhone user but I prefer the android AOD I dont want or care about the wallpaper showing I want it to only show the essential information black  off which means no battery consumption except for the pixels showing information
Pre ordered the 14 pro for the wife to replaced her 11 with cracked screen and Im considering upgrading from my 13 pro max to the 14 because the max is big and heavy to carry around
You can do better than a keychron Q1 
Your intros are to long
every time you touch the  dynamic island you smudge up the front camera
What about battery life
I feel like Im the only one who hates the Dynamic Island I mean its like a distracting moving notch instead of the fixed one Theres nothing nice about it to be honest
Off topic but I need that table Brand
Did you just admit to breaking the NDA 
Bruh you just drop an iPhone like its nothing
Battery is living after 2000 nets Wow
Honestly couldnt this have been done with a system update this is just software programming nothing new idk if there even a type c charger on it yet other then that other phones have 5 cameras while we still have 3 smh Apple lost its way in Inventing new things
Shout out to the LG V10 The company was so often ahead of its time
Whered you get that noice wallpaper
WHAT AN INTRO  Kudos to Brandon
Am I the only one who feels like this Dynamic Island is gonna stick out more than the current notches when using the phone
No wifi 6E  No Quad HD Display  No 8k Video Recording  We Are Entering 2023
Love you Marques
no
I rant so much about lighting I still have a XS Max I would love to upgrade my iPhone But why even bother if its still lighting port Im just going to be patient till USB C is standard in all of apple products
Im considering upgrading to this from my XS but Im not sure if its really worth it without the USB C that never seems to come I mean I already have lightning cables so its whatever but Id like it to be a bit more futureproof if Im going to use it for 34 years Not sure if putting money into it to replace the battery is worth it when the rear camera has a crack in the lens that Apple refused to cover under warranty so the resale value is almost nothing
Awesome intro
"This is deceptive move by Apple to advance the NEW WORLD AGENDA  The esim is tool they deceptive Ly will be using to usher their DIGITAL ID for humanitythis is what they are not telling the public

I am hoping humanity will say a NO to the the new Apple phone"
Wallpaper  Backdrops App 
I heard that the 14 plus and the 14 is not selling well for the pre orders but it was expected since theres not much change The 14 plus however performs even worse than the 13 mini and SE 2022 based on preorder sales They shouldve continued the mini lineup Or even improved to make 14 mini pro or anything like that Thatll be cool Will be missing the mini though 
Just smack your phone 
Needs some more focus on battery also if you do another detailed review would be interesting to see how much battery improvement the new 5g modem is bringing 5g on 13 and 12 series is battery hogger
About the eSIM I think its not exclusive to US Ive been searching around and the iPhone 14 EU version has no SIM too
AOD on this phone doesnt really turn the screen off if the wallpaper is still slightly visible This could be the reason why the hit on battery life is more than expected This approach is just different for the sake of being different
Imo the android way of always on display is more battery efficient which is the point of aod
Still waiting on the flip 4 review
so no ipad
I dont understand why people think iphones have good screens They all feel so cheap and hollow for some reason
Would it be worth it if youre on the iPhone upgrade program Im on the fence about committing to the annual upgrade when half my current phone is paid off and just ending it altogether Currently rocking a 13 Pro Max
The new intro looks nice but the scene transitions when showing a category name are a meh in my opinion No need for that song while transitions too i guess
Should i buy this or stick to my 1st gen iPhone se
Im torn between buying iPhone 14 Pro and waiting until 15 Pro with my 11 Pro maybe its better to wait
"boringso much money for that
seriously
NOT WORTH IT"
is the speaker still as good as the 13 pro max  this speaker is insane for a pone
Ahh yes apple finally woke up to the fact that there is a notch on top of the phone
nice transitions at the beginning
"funny fact people doesnt know
samsung already have tyw features of the dynamic island 
I have the features on my A51 about 3 month ago 
the notification bar and everything 
the iPhone must rebrand  it another name lol 
SAMSUNG FOR ME 
WE ALL KNOW THE TRUTH"
Just so everyone knows crash detection isnt new The Pixel phones have had it for a couple years now
LGV10 Show us compare wheres it I want to see it
The only time I think crash detection would go off besides getting into a car accident is when Elon musk takes off to mars
Youre the best I always watch your reviews first So perfectly done
wait a sec so you are telling me that now I cant answer the phone normally I need to move my hand around a huge device to push a little dot on top of the phone I am not sure Apple observed but no body has a finger in that area Lets back track a little apple cut out portion of the display disregarding the customers then force the customers move the entire device to accept a call something that is the primary use for the device I mean aside the literally insulting Apple attitude and atrocious UI is there anyone left with a little common sense there this is so insanely dumb that I am out of words to describe it Their entire OS is anywhere between 6 and 30 years behind anything on the planet and this is their update I mean this is worse then my note 8 I was looking to replace
Does the clock move on the Always on display I havent seen that mentioned else wont that accelerate burn in On the Samsung phones the clock moves round the screen to prevent this happening
Something tells me marques already has pixel 7 review units
Does anyone care about 60hz when Apple does it
Until they start making phones more resistible to scratches and other damages Im just going to stuff it in a case so the externals really dont matter that much
Why doesnt Apple raise the base area of the camera to match the height of the lenses so its not so difficult to clean
I honestly hope that dynamic island wont be copied that much Yes its practical but its still a ugly black think covering a big part of the screen while watching content
Curious what does the 5 mean on the 5G signal Is it the same as 5G UC  I have an Iphone 12 Pro and hadnt seen the  before
1940 I honestly did not like this text thing all over the screen you people can do it better pls do something like iPhone wallpaper digital clock thing where the photo gets overlapped with the clock or something else nice I know you can 
That watch tan
Thats bullshit They are not technically capable of hiding the lens behind the screen so they leave another marketing fart
The final number is already known when you started the video considering your biased view in favour of apple  There is too much emphasis on zoom  For the common consumer Samsung images are fairly good and the difference is minor  Not all users are professional photographers
Best tech review intros in the biz
I think the intro song disarm has become like mkbhd theme since the 10 million video
I watch you MKBHD and mrwhoistheboss Love you both
I am so excited for this Friday A new iPhone for me and the other iPhone that I ordered by mistake will be bought by my mother I am so glad all in my family like Apple Who would not like Apple and its ecosystem is a good question also
So these things couldve just fit in the status bar right Its a fun software idea but the way people react to this like its some kind of huge innovation
Shes a real beauty but Im sure Apple has integrated a tone of new OS enforced lock outs that will make it next to impossible to self repair Sorry children dont break your screen unless you have 700 to have it repaired by Apple Our local shop has already said We wont be able to work on the 14 for quite some time
Also all those sensors on the Crash Detection will leave your mic and sensors on to exploit
Yall better be careful Apples gonna poach your intro people if you keep this level up  
Dynamic Island is so good that they can easily hide that giant ugly shit notchpunch hole thing on a rather good display
LG always made improvements and innovated but no one bat an eye I used to only use their phones but made the switch to apple due to constant hardware issues with lg phones
The Dynamic Island is stupid They could have the current notch also expand like this but nope Apple This software upgrade we are delivering via Phone rather than OTA update wont come to the 13 if it did you wouldnt buy the 14 pro max
good luck touching that island on the pro max
Sexy intro after long long time
Its just me but Doesnt it happen to them that with this cell phone there are too many doors to track you and know about you at any time
"copy
china will not copy because the make it"
"Fact
Dynamic island  back screen flip4

Fanboi
Dynamic island  everything"
How is it watching a 169 YouTube video Cause with the current notch it just cuts through the edge of the video but with the new Dynamic Island being situated closer to the center of the phone I wonder how it will affect screening of 169 content
Love the wallpaper Link anyone
use a remote control car bro
Hate the idea of not having USB C I would change my Pixel if they do that cant believe they still stick with that connector after all the issues it brings
An 18 improvement in multicore performance is pretty significant no
what about this phone on my nightstand is it going to be beaming in my face all night because it is always on
I agree about the always on Doesnt seem purposeful or customizable I see the need on a watch but a phone Ill prob turn mine off
I think the dynamic Island takes up more screen space than the notch on last years iPhone 13 Pro and pro Max
Crash Detection will go off all the time cause iPhone users constantly drop their phones lol
Some iSheep problems Fingering front camera all the time Then taking a selfie Why do my photos look blurry
Apple strategy is more of a marathon than a speed run But love them or hate them when they finally adopt an innovation they often know how to put their own spin on it
Whats so terrible about a bezel Seems like it would be far less obtrusive than a cutout
Can you turn off HDR As a photographer thats literally all I care about 13 Pro is killing me
Bro that dynamic island looks bad
The intro is always great but the video is pretty boring
Whens Apple going to add a close all apps to multitasking Its been on Android for ages surely its not difficult to implement
Removal of Sim slot is a big bummer
How does the max screen brightness duration stack up to the 12 Pro Max the phone Im still rockin The new features are nice but not enough to get me to upgrade The only annoying thing about my current phone is anytime it gets a little warm from cranking the brightness a little bit while outside on a sunny day it would dim too much for any enjoyable use I was hoping for Apple to add something like a vapor chamber or heat disappating layer under the screen so it could keep the screen cranked at full brightness in bright conditions Can you testcompare the max brightness duration of the Pro Max line over the years Anyway great video
Video eastereggs are funny Love that you used the Tesla surfboard for crash detection  The globe for dynamic island and satellite connectivity was cool too And the obvious display thats onAND BRIGHT 
Does it come with type c charger
What is the calendar Lock Screen widget he has
Im on team need the latest iPhone but have a new iPhone still
Cinematic always supported 30 fps 24 is new this year
This phone is going to be a huge PITA when traveling abroad
I mean they are giving 1k towards new phone with trade in so might as well
They copy it from honor lol
Very nice presentation
for how much time does the notification stay there what if I am not interested in constantly seeing waveform of video being played it looked a lot like a disturbance to me
Dynamic Island or Doraemons  4D pocket I wish the notch was smaller 
Was hoping you would show pictures from the 13 pro vs the 14 pro Better specs dont always translate to better pictures
What do you techies recommend Getting the iPhone 14 Pro 256 GB or the iPhone 14 Pro Max 255 GB
Its actually still got a lightning port in 2022
When youre holding the phone or showing it in a shot Itd be cool if you showed somewhere whether its the pro or the pro max Would make it easier to help decide which size is btetter for us
How does the phone tell the difference between a roller coaster with high speeds and sudden stops
I hate the notch
i wish they did a pro mini the 13 mini is the best phone i have ever used and I am dreading the day it dies The size is perfect for my tiny little boy hands
ok ill keep my iPhone X for the next year
I really hope the dynamic island isnt copied Weve spent the last few years making selfie camera close to invisible with small holepunch cameras and Id hate to have a massive chunk of my screen taken up by a floating widget just because Apple did it
I remember that LG phone from seven years ago and that I thought it was a really cool concept that would catch on 
those camera lenses starting to look like tumors getting bigger every year
Its techtember yall
Me looking closer to see dynamic island physics
If I throw my phone to the wall will it take it as a crash
Regarding the Dynamic Island one drawback I can see is that youd always have to wipe off the fingerprints and smudges before taking a selfie photo Probably not a big deal for most but still
No Marquese tap is open and hold is contextual menus Its the whole phones UX Why would they do it differently just for the Disland
I cant wait until Friday for my Deep Purple Pro Max
Its just me or someone also think that the full screen video experience is really worse than a regular notch Its there there
Dude that intro 
my s10 is still better  jesus when the fuck can i finally get an iphone these suck  im not taking a down grade just to get blue messages
1111 You actually said Connecting airpods twice  while listing the features
"How the fuck did MKBHD get this new iPhone so quick Its not even out yet
Also the 14 pros are the definition of incrementalism because I have a 13 pro max and I dont need this "
it still has a tendency to overexpose people with dark skin constantlyi would know 
How quickly is it going to get annoying having to wipe your front camera from all the finger prints that will get on it using the dynamic island 
Did anyone ever reached out to make and advt for them
Does Dynamic Island not show you notifications when the screen is off Thats one reason Im having trouble migrating to iPhone from Galaxy When my phones screen is off and someone texts me the notification shows up without lightning up the whole screen and it is very useful
Wallpaper name 
1114 wire transfer 12500 
The into was truly epic
"Marques This would be copied 

Me Actually Apple copied Xiaomi Their implementation was just better
 
Satellite communication was technically announced by Huawei before Apple did Only problem is Huawei remains a 4G phone and a China only phone However this service would only be in the USNorth America 

You can still be factual even with APPLE PR Cool Review plus those images are fire  though"
I Hope It Flops Just Because Of Sim Card Tray Hell With The Other Gimmicks
Yo what the hell I never knew about that zoom wheel at 1606 Thats awesome and I will definitely be using that instead of pinch to zoom from now on
Its going to be hard for fakes to copy this with is nice BTW I want to know about that tesla surfboard behind you there as always loved the video
655 The lock screen  We already know about Pixel shifting to help prevent burnin but what about That THICK clock Can it pixel shift enough to ease those pure white bars of the clock burning lines
Marques you low key say low key far too much these days I low key cant stop noticing it on every video
Sadly the sim tray situation made me realize that next year US iPhones might still be lightening but Europe ones might get USB C
Chevron sign on a hoodie Hummel lawyers
"Not sure why people are still surprised that theres minor upgrades from last years model Phones are meant to last years people 

IMO you should be upgrading after 3 years minimum to really appreciate an upgrade"
Does the always on display get effected by the brightness you have set If I have my normal brightness set quite low will that make it dim more when the screen is off
Can we take a minute to appreciate how good the intro is Honestly it deserves an award
"Does touching the Dynamic Island multiple times make the faceID and Front camera mess up performance 
Like will the faceID not work properly bcz you have touched it multiple times"
"Dude between you and Arun Mr Whos The Boss you two are the best tech channels on YouTube

with that said though 65 for a hoodie Whoa that is asking an awful lot dontcha think Id love to buy your swag and I know a bunch of people whod even know what it was and who it was from but stillour budgets arent what they used to be Just a thought Still love your channel and find it one of my top 2 online  and that wont change"
excellent plug for that Dbrand case
Your thumb looks sick in that Mario shot
Internals display cameras pretty much just mentioned the 3 components of a smartphone D
Whats that calendar widget in the Lock Screen
Edit 
So MKBHD Loves Ye
Floss lol
These reviews are getting better and better no cap
everyones about to have the dirtiest front cameras
Android users admit something is kinda cool challenge impossible
Marcus you are the best
This as already been copied Xiaomi themes mimicking the Dynamic Island are already available
Purple loooking goood decepticon  color 
Whoever does the intros needs a raise and nice hoodie looks great Thanks for the review hopefully we get a new AirPods Pro review as well
That new feature will make you rage on selfie photos if you have to clean to use just my guest
Apple could literally take the entire screen away call it an improvement and peopled buy it No sim seriously
Now imagine if Apple didnt do this Dynamic island thing and just named their ishaped cutout as The iNotch 
Dynamic Island Another way to make sure to use both hands on a phone
Wallpaper pls 
Dynamic island is peak apple Every phone can do that but when they name it its now a new revolutionary idea
1720 bagging on apple staying on lightning cable transfer speeds and not updating to USB typec
Does anyone know what those dots widget are on his Lock Screen on the left
Always On Display one of the most useless things and now every android user laughing about the iPhone but who gives a fuck about that you dont use it and if I want to look at the clock then I just look at my watch
Did you know when you turn your display it shows your wallpaper in the background
wonder if the dynamic island is usable on the pro max considering the size Would It be difficult to reach the top part of the screen
Why not make a 15second video on all the things new with the base iPhone 14
Im actively trying not to reach you the top of my phone Dynamic island is stupid
Completely unrelated but I love Marquess music taste  Never thought the biggest American tech YouTuber would be using music from niche French artists like Hocus Pocus and 20syl
They change one little thing and every body loses their minds 
Some judge should rule it illegal for Apple to call this Pro without USBC with USB4 IO
So concerned about not sim slot I travel often
The words coming on screen like displaycameras is not working
That intro was absolutely amazing its even better than Apples commercials
What about battery
Viva LG
Shout out to my fellow Oneplus 7T owners iPhone got AOD before we did
Flight of Stairs  see what you did there
"Some awesome features in Photos of iOS 16 I just stumbled on
 The Hidden folder now uses FaceId before opening
 There is a Duplicates folder right above Hidden which automatically identifies duplicates and allows you to merge them"
Im currently using the iPhone 11 Pro and I still dont find this worthy of upgrading your best off paying 60 at the Apple Store to replace the battery and waiting to see what the iPhone 15 Pro will offer
Takes a real techie to understand the genius of the name dynamic island bored with youtubers dunking on this for no reason at all Even otherwise its an interesting name not sure why people dislike it
They totally did steal the island idea from LG Come on Apple Smh
"Love your videos as usual Thanks for being on point with the LG comment We know they all steal from them Still best fingerprint reader from the G5

But this comment is about the hoodie Just bought it and a bit sad to see 10 shipping to Manhattan and 2 weeks on top of it Could I just come to Jersey and collect it sooner kidding not kidding"
The small music visualizer is actually a REAL ONE Jesus how much I hated how everyone just put a looping random animation of a visualizer and Apple has it so small and so easily looked over and its actually going by the music youre playing Bass mids treble and all that Thats attention to detail
Not done watching yet but thank you for citing LG as the original inventors of this idea
"Apple event 
Hurry  hurry "
im the only one who doesnt like dynamic island ima keep my 13pro
Coming from an iPhone 7 Plus This is definitely an upgrade Well iPhone 7 Plus cant support anymore the new iOS 16 so its really time to upgrade Imagine how many years the support of iOS 56 years Thats long 
Cinematic mode was already 30 fps
01 We Here Bird Sound To Show Dynamic Island Nice touch by Editor
When i heard LG MADE IT
Where can I get those always on display options For android that is 
Apple is investing more in marketing of the product than value add from the product And people are falling in to buy the product 
Hope Samsung will never copy that  Apple just get rid of that awful disguised notch Once and for all 
Is the always on display available for iPhone 13 pro max  Also I liked the name dynamic island  It makes sense 
Make sure you give it a good review as youll never get another review copy
how does the island behave if reacbility is activated
Who from android is gonna copy this when theyve all but gotten rid of the notchpillwhatever Android has plenty of apps that provide just as much and more usability and convenience
Your enjoyable to watch Just exciting enough 14 pro or 14 pro max that is the question
Im gonna defend the Dynamic Island every time someone knocks the name  I think the issue is for some of us the name is perfect for those of us who appreciate literal definitions  Maybe its cheesy but I instantly knew what they meant when they first announced it before even showing the features
I see a sat finder app for dish alignment
Love ya man but 6500 for a hoodie is kinda pricy Im sorry 
That Hoodie Looks So Damn Good
Apple copies everything Good that we have something innovative for Android to copy 
Whats the first lock screen widget he has  Kinda looks like braille
Man YouTube is really crapping on the 4k uploads compression artifacts everywhere  Makes those nice RED cams pointless
Just the dopest intro ever Ding dang
Honestly not impressed rather have under display camera
If you cant get rid of it embrace itwelcome to the dynamic island
"WTF dude That intro looks Superdope Next level Intro Im watching YouTube since 10 yrs
but this is by far far the best intro Ive ever seen for a smartphone review Kudos MKBHD"
Did you miss discussing the BATTERY 
Incredible devices but Ill stick to my SE 3
Wow so it seems with dynamic island you wont get that annoying right in the middle notification when you cant even use the phone until you click Ok on a prompt saying your battery level is low Thats big W after all those years 
"I was down to buy the 14 Pro but this video convinced me otherwise Thanks for saving me money
I want to switch from Android which iPhone would you recommend right now"
Man I wish I was you Getting new tech even before its out and having fun exploring it and knowing what exactly and how to review it in the best and more simple way Let me just shrink back to my iPhone 8 plus  Hopefully I will have a chance too with the 2104  2113 in fuuuuutuuuureee 
sickest into ever
Apple makes the most simple and Human tech from what I can tell Meant for people who really dont like thinking much I can see why theyre so popular but there will always be a better cheaper android phone Thats why Ill never buy an iphone lol no matter how neat they seem you can get better for less
Well Apple copied a LOT of things and called it innovative and slapped couple more hundred dollars So yea others should copy this
I only see a drunk notch Sorry
Still not enough to replace xperia
Always on display so unnecessary
"They should have really get rid of notch 100  completely 
That would have been an iphone level innovation 

This island shit is "
X2D on Dope Tech soon
30FPS sucks for cinematic content Stop trying 
People thinking my iPhone 12 Pro is 14 when Im using without cover
It makes darker skinned people look like shit absolutely nothing like themselves and you still call it the best camera BRUHHHHHHH
dont people feel stupid that apple tries to sell the dynamic island as the big change this year thats so dumb  i feel nothing
Why we all pretending that we want to reach to the top of our humongous phones to play with an unsightly notch so regularly Its a poor cover up for poor innovation
Its a good way to make a notch useful to some extent But if apple could remove the notch entirely of course they would do Honestly I still think a smaller cutout like the flagship androids have is still the best right now
Though the iphone 14 is cool and all but its just that i feel like Apple kind of lacked in making the Iphone 14 because the only thing thats new is the dynamic island and a bit of improvement from the camera display bionic chip and small new features but from the rumors of samsung s23 its starting to look like samsung might take this win but of course it all comes down to your preference
The Apple way for alwayson display is the 1 hz drop to save battery Which others arent doing
LG has been ripped off
How did the weather app show 69
I aspire to one day be at this god tier level of dropping a new phone and not checking to see if it is cracked Loved the intro Great video
Its been done before
Apple slowly catching up to the Android features Next is usbc
Was planning on upgrading from my s20 ultra but now Im gonna wait for the 15 Such a big disappointment
wont people have the most smudged up selfies lol
I upgraded my iPhone 13 Pro Max for FREE by holding it in my two hands and believing it was a 14 Pro Max It Worked  No one can tell   I love the benefits of my new iPhone 14 Pro Max
Love the candid review
Idk man thats veryyy cool but I have the 13 pro max Not enough to get me to upgrade that quick  Ill wait the usual 4 years
Best intro award goes to Marques and the team MKBHD
Always ON display is the worst one 
wow the screen bezel is so much more curved than i expected
Here after struggling thru Motorola adds
new phone lol
Wow LG was way Ahead of time Sad to see no more inovation from LG
they are saving 8K video for next year
The dynamic island  is a pretty cool gimmick with a purpose  I like it cant wait for it to get to 
"Key inventions for 14 pro
1 Notch  Dynamic Island
2 AOD
3 Physical sim removal
Etc1 Silicon upgrade but it doesnt matter according to Apple as they didnt upgrade it for base 14 models
Etc2 Satellite communication Good luck not needing to use it"
I hope Android phones dont copy it because I like forgetting about the camera cutout I dont want it to be embraced and remind me constantly its there
I must say That island look hideous when not animating
Look at your dogs face in that pic
Like other companies Apple is also running after number
Marques wallpapers what calendar app do you use with that nice lockscreen widget I always notice such and I just want to know 
Mentally I always try NOT TO TOUCH the frontfacing camera sensor with my fingers because I want to keep the sensor clean and able to take great pictures The one bad thing about this Dynamic Island they introduced is that it invites you to touch that area of your phone repeatedly
Pls share wallpaper link
My 13 pro has become laggy since the launch of 14
No need for a 1000 hole in your pocket ATT gave me 1000 for my 13 Pro Max 1166 a month for the lease that everyone balks about My 13 Pro Max was 1622 a month So for the 194 out of the 1399 now I get a new phone every year use it all year and pay 10 of the total value just to trade it in 12 months later for a brand new one under warranty
"They should also get included useless washing machine  feature 
Incase a person stuck in wild life and he needs to wash his cloths 
"
"COME ON YALL 

That Intro Mr Brownlee "
Are you doing a give away
VIdeo quality even in 4k seems off 
They still selling yall the notch 
Wait till Samsung drops
Did Marques really repurpose a trashcan MacPro into a vase XD
Perhaps next year they will release iPhone 15 Pro Ultra typeC  8K video resolution  internal storage up to 4TB  crazy hardware software price tag start with 1999
Completely forgot about the LG V10 but thats the same philosophy behind what they did with the empty forehead in the phones from that time
Bumper cars may work for the crash test
Me and my wife have 11pro max were only upgrading for 5G I know it came out on the 12 but we only upgrade every 3 years or more I was tempted to wait another year but Im a truck driver and Im having a terrible time with my phone service in bigger cities DallasHouston was looking into buying a booster but hoping the 5G will fix this
LG invented the ultra wide angle
Marques said he would pass on the Tesla model S plaid but I always see shots if it in his videos
Its not a small feature 
Lets talk about the intro because we know we clicked for it 
The dynamic notch is better than nothing but i would take no notch  punchout anyday like my current phone onenote from year 2019
Unrelated subject but is it just Me or did Marquezs New Yorker accent become stronger today
lets see
Now watching MKBHD and after that listening to Hocus Pocus and 20syl 
Having worse battery life than the 13 Pro Max scares me a lot I know it might be AOD but still I thought it should be able to do it no problem maybe waste 5 battery all day Smh More features that we cant use in real world because well drain our batteries Thats exactly why I got rid of Samsung and Pixel They keep adding features and new things that then phone hardware cant keep up with specifically Battery Life I would really disappointed if Dynamic Island ends up draining battery life even more I can imagine it would if its running in the background 247 I hope there will be an option to completley turn it off  I just want the Pill and Punchhole separate and to do nothing Not get bigger lol Its already intrusive enough
you almost got me I may update to an apple
Would a roller coaster ride trigger that IPhone 14 Car Crash Detection
why exactly would I want the punch hole to get bigger and take up more room Especially to show stuff like music
"Haha type C rant for another day 
But that purple iphone tho Sheeeeeesh"
Do you think you are going to be doing the new AirPods Pro 2 review
Bro you gotta kill those lantern flies theyre increasing here in NJ like crazy
i was considering iPhone 14 Pro now its pretty much nailed Cos Marques makes a video about it and the video showed 444 at 1758 my lucky number
How can the phone tell the difference between crash detection and lets say you dropping the phone on pavement Both are hard impacts so how can it tell the difference between one hard impact vs another And yeah how can the watch tell the difference between me starting a workout by running up a flight of stairs vs running up a flight of stairs because I forgot something and Im in a hurry I dont want to know that Im gonna have to remember to stop a workout because it thinks Im starting a workout by running up a flight of stairs and not because Im running up a flight of stairs because Im in a hurry
Dynamic Island does look awesome I am still nervous about it cutting into horizontal content though
most notifications not making use of the dynamic island is kinda disappointing
His take was sponsored hahaha
In ur bag
How did they even manage to make the selfie camera even more ugly No one can even do that even if they tried but they somehow did
This is a copy
The dynamic island feature might make me upgrade from 13 pro to 14 pro
First time super boring video
the satellite feature is something i said should have been on phones a long time ago lol
Lets be honest the iPhones from the back a so similar to the 11s The triple hob style and even worse for the regular ones that have loose connections to the XRnot the best look
K30 did that style pill cutout with black pixels first time
No real innovation since the iPhone X in fact they have gone backwards with removal of 3D Touch and same design language as iPhone 4
Sri lankan people right now be like  oh nice phone Ill wait a couple of years till it drops the price to half
Iphone  silencesilence  14  silence silence  PRO
Anyone know what is that widget with the dots on the lockscreen
My favourite tech review channel when I saw that iPhone 14 reviews are out I ran straight to the MKBHD channel 
im on a XR i need the upgrade
So tech reviewers get new model way earlier than its released date eh Interesting
"Its these small steps thatll make a phone thatll be legendary A game changer Like it happened back in the day Iphone 5 was it 
Camera is still kinda ugly tho"
If Steve Jobs were alive He would have never approved new ios16 UI changes Specifically made for adding new lock screen with confusing icons
Hey Marques you should do a battery life test without always on display on So one test with it on and one test with it off
Apples version of an AOD is a joke Why doesnt it just display the time and date like every other phone running Android Of course its going to affect battery life when your entire wallpaper is showing regardless of how dim they make it and the Hz dropping to 1
That watch tan line though 1813 
am i the only one who doesnt care about the always on display and also in general im still on my XS apple stock should drop tbh
Its insane that we are not talking about the dynamic Island becoming a fingerprint magnet and blurring the front facing camera
Thinking of switching from Android to this phone Good idea
I wonder if rollercoasters could set off the crash detection
Awesome video Well done
Would you recommend an iPhone 11 in 2022
How is Apple seemingly so far behind the trends yet simultaneously setting the major trends
Doesnt home and lock screen include always on display in battery usage
Show us LG v10 clip  
dropping an iphone like that hurt me
Excellent Marques the best 
Intro is fire Great job to the crew and powerful expensive hardwaresoftware involved 
Hey I use Todoist
My guy said the dynamic island is so friendly and approachable like hes trying to talk to a chick lol Dynamic Island is a copy within itself from LG Ive never seen so much hype around a notification bar Love how MKBHD keeps it 100
KING APPLE SOFTWARE NEXT LEVEL
basically a notification bar but lower
The higher brightness sounds super great but my biggest question is for how long My aging 11 pro max definitely seems to be lacking brightness but the biggest issue is how it is forced to dim with I guess the heat of the phone After having a video playing for 30 mins or so sitting in my truck in Florida at max brightness it automatically forces a dim by anywhere from 15 like 40 to where I can barely see it how long can you actually be at 2000 nits with the 14
Iphone 14 Pro camera is better than the S22 Ultra Really to say its the best camera of 2022 is a bold statement 48 MP compared to S22 Ultra 108 MP Plus we all know that you can do wonders in editing with lightroom This camera does not look like its the best This phone is clearly a low grade update phone for people who have Iphone 10 or 11
nNce hoodie
Love the sound of the birds when he mentioned DYNAMIC ISLAND 
Dynamic island hhh  Apple treating their customers as idiots
If their camera can only take 12 megapixel photos then its only a 12 megapixel camera not a 48 megapixel camera
From iPhone 13 the iphones just look horrendous that fat ugly camera back sticking out  wish they could somehow have a cleaner design like the iPhone X Hoped the iPhone 14 would have a more elegant look
If theres a jailbreak for iOS 16 and make this dynamic island feature work with the current iPhone 13 12 11 X models notch it will change the feel Fingers crossed  that jailbreak developers are on this cant wait
When the full screens happened a few years ago and the notch was a huge topic of discussion everyone was talking about how there would eventually be a solve for it Dynamic island is the first thing that actually feels like a solution
I like this new iteration but there are 2 things I dont like They changed how you choose the wallpaper from Home Screen and Lock Screen separately You now have to change them both at the same time to the same thing Dumb move That personalized Spatial audio setup sucks it let me do the front face but refused to do my ears go figure
I think 8K is useless for everyphone now Most other phones dont even understand how to make 4K video shoot better
Waiting on my iPhone 14 Pro Max 1TB coming from the XS Max Im definitely going to enjoy the new update and its costing me half the price with the Verizon exchange phone promo
Everytime have to clean the fingerprint smudges on the front facing camera after using the dynamic island 
The dynamic island is gimmick apple invented to differentiate it from the 13 pro This wont work on other phones since most phones dont have huge pill size holes
oh yay they released jailbroken iphone 4 wow
guys pls spend 1299 so that your alarm clock is now in the notch lmao
The worst notch to be have in 2022 just saved by the software
I miss my LG V20 and its weird second screen so much 
The Dynamic Island thing just looks so bad And I know everyones going to copy it and Ill probably be buying something that is similar to this if not an exact copy but still it looks so ugly on a clean screen
Thats literally always on display 
I still use the huawei p30 pro can I ask do you think its worth changing  to a iPhone 14 pro
Peter McKinnon  1701 
im not moved by that dynamic island thing
Even though I like Dynamic Island Wouldnt the front facing camera lens be always dirty After continuously using it
Just want to take the time to point out that there is a Tesla Surfboard in the back to pay tribute to that Island life among other Easter eggs Im curious to see what you spotted
Shoutout to the LG V10
This for all intents and purposes is an S model and the S model was always the best version to get
In sweden its 1500 its 50 markup
I generally see apple as a innovative company but recent launch doesnt show anything innovative rather than  camera upgrade and software upgrades 
Where do I get that wallpaper 
If Apple just allowed screeninscreen and USBC Id probably be an apple stan
What if the new iPhone SE was a flip
I pre ordered this iPhone Just because Im super tired of the Notch i want that stupid dynamic island I already see myself using this feature like a boss
I will go on for the 14 Pro Max but Im kind of disappointed the only new features for the past 2 years are the cameras The only new features are Dynamic island ok  camera inner features But I really miss touch ID  they could make it at least more fun like changing the ringtones  just an iPhone lover but i wish for more
Bon Iver mix intro 
Upgrading from an 11 Pro Max to the 14 Pro Max Im just excited for 5G 
no you didnt  drop it like that lol
Nice wallpaper link please
Knowing that my 2022 SE has a chip almost as fast as the 14 pro I think Ill definitely be waiting a few generations to upgrade
DAMN THE INTRO
Im keeping my 13 Pro This is just so they released something haha
Best review Period
Bro your videos are the best
So in a way the Dynamic island is pretty much a touch bar for iPhone
"Pretty excited to be upgrading from my 11 Pro a strict 3 year minimum rule means I get huge upgrades such as

5G
120Hz
Brighter display 
Finally 48mp 
Dynamic Island
Ceramic Shield 

And probably a bunch more I cant think of right now either way it makes the upgrade so much better"
No sim card 
This is one of the best intros since the Galaxy S21 video
1807 i would know 
I will call Car Crash detection Israel Detection xD
Thumbs up for that clean intro
That MKBHD intro though
If you see all samsung device camera cutout already being used for notification and other feature surrounding light apple did the same just with bigger noth
Thank you for nice reviews cant wait mine now lol 
these intros getting better each year
"heyyy love the video mate
 do you sell MKBHD merch at the Stevens duck store"
Ok thats nice
The S21 has 3 cameras a 12mp main 12mp ultrawide and 64mp telephoto Jst like the iphone 14 the s21 also switches to the 12mp window of the 64MB sensor to make for detailed zoom And my phone was released last year The 14pro really does look stunning tho 3
When apple copy something from android people say made in apple way haha
people would only buy the iphone 14 pro just for the dynamic island other than that there is nothing new Obviously nobody is going to buy it because of the emergency features
Wont all that tapping close to the selfie camera for the Dynamic Island features make the front of the lens dirty
More Mac videos please 
"Technically Apple copied Dynamic island from Samsung
In Samsung OneUI devices there is dynamic island like animation on receiving calls and notifications
Apple just modified this thing "
Camera King Really MKBHD Check your Orange dark hands in all the photos
Is the auto focus channel only going to be electric vehicles
"android software will never be optimized the way iOS is optimized android needs to cater to so many various types of hardware while iOS just caters to apple hardware

android users prefer a slightly less refined software for more gimmicky and sometimes useful features while apple users prefer a refined software on the features that are absolutely essential and important to mobile device users"
I dont like notch phones
so if i drop my phone while on an airplane it will call 911
Who cares about the IPhone That hoodie
Im a pixelandroid guy but I gotta say I think they made it worse I dont mind a notch its fine how else are you going to have a front camera without bezels but the whole island thing is dumb now its like a giant blob in the screen
Apple excels as usual there is no real competitor to the iPhone so far you want a real integrated phone there is only the iPhone in the market
Honestly I feel like the new punchole isnt much of an improvement over the notch The space between the punchole and edge of the screen is so small that it can barely display anything useful on it if anything it protrudes closes to the center of the display than the notch giving you less overall usable screen estate
Lets call it a 13s Pro
It seems to me Apple could have built the island on the 13 Pro Max too
isnt it sad the the main feature on the new iPhone that costs way over 1000 is the Notch
I have to say man your intro music just rocks
Whats about battery
Already done I think Someone did the music player in MIUI
You go with 14 or max 
Cant wait for some YouTuber to crash test a car for their iPhone 14 review
Him throwing the phone without hesitation killed me Hahahaha
Pro Max starts at 1100 USD Thats quite a difference to 1500 EUR in Finland for the base Pro Max Its gotten ridiculously expensive
Samsung ads on iphone review lol
bro please my closet is already like half hoodies but I just really cant resist
Nice video Wish Apple would rethink their strategy of new year new phone Considering jumping a market to every two years would bring some hype instead of their current trend of find what we did different in the same shell
"Im tired of Apple Used to be a real apple fan but I cant stand the same sht year after year Always on display What an innovative idea 
Its been forever for Android phones

In my opinion nothing has changed significantly

Switching to Android right now
Dynamic Island Too little for the last 4 years No big deal actually"
I dont think I wouldve been able to keep that secret Nobody wouldnt believe me anyway lol
Great videos Keep up the great work
I honestly dont like dynamic island cause 1 It was a marketing scheme to sell 14 for 13 or 12 people 2 it is worse than Notch cause it takes more of vertical screen so my full screen videos have to cropped more 3 as the Notch has screen on both sides I would will realize there is a screen that is going to waste above it 4 they couldve easily implemented this feature for old notches while saving space and all but no they wanted to sell 14 more than that
"This will be copied 
Every iPhone is copied Yes looking at you Nothing Samsung Xiaomi "
When you know the intro is better than apples own advertisement 
Oh okay Its not a physical notch
"As our superman said
Not impressed 

Will wait for iPhone 15
14 is  for me"
Cant wait for all the blurry selfie pics with everyone touching their front facing camera to use the Dynamic Island 
Seagulls were a nice touch
That intro mad 
Im in the UK and dont understand the eSim thing When I travel I dont need a newdifferent sim I can just use the same sim can stil use data calls and texts etc is it different in the US
No Sim Card slot is a terrible decision for those of us who travel outside of the US frequently Dont tell me I should pay loads more a month with Verizon to enable roaming when I can pick up a Sim anywhere in Europe for 5 and then toss it when I need to Its much more convenient than current eSIM offerings
Collaso will be proud 
I preordered an IPhone 14 Pro Max excited to see the improvements from my current Xr  I think its now a good time to upgrade
The esim is in canada too You can just buy a card with your esim and setup and go
Damn this intro music brings me back to the old MKBHD videos
Love esim and especially for travel purposes  dont need to spend 30 min in a sketchy provider office wondering if they rip me off And I assume hidden feature is that that makes it hard for thief to throw sim card away once they steal the phone  more time for police to intervene
Brainwashed people its a damn notch lmao
I got it because I had the 12
Its so uncomfortable watching the fingerprint across the front camera
is that a 14 pro or pro max in your hand
No sim slot makes this a nonstarter for international travelers
Ive the 13 pro max and in my opinion theres not enough to upgrade to it I love my phone
1813 Is that an apple watch tanline 
Most of us boughtpre ordered the phone before knowing anything about it lol
Not a fan of always on tbh even on my Apple Watch I have it off it
"Honestly I feel like the Dynamic Island is just a gimmick and a glorified task switcher You have the task bar on top to keep track of whats running in the background 
This update is more of an eye candy for a phone Only proper update I see in iPhone 14 pro is the camera all other additions are nothing impressive TBH"
been thinking about switching back to the iphone for a while now after i left after the iphone 4 but not if i have to carry an extra cable too bad
Samsung implemented this type of AOD to their smart watches many years ago Apple just coppied it lol
Im very curious if a rough rollercoaster would set off the crash detection That is pretty much the only thing I think could trigger it without a real crash
brownlee  toss me the 13 now that u gat a 14pro   Space black will do Thanks for the review though
So he make a review of iPhone and not a fold 4 tell you which side he is on
You said connecting AirPods twice 
Same what apple doing for last 10 year 
To me it just seems like a gimmick to psychologically trick you into not thinking that isnt a notch and at the same time basically locking them in with no criticism to carry on using these cheap screens for the next few years I can picture it in the apple meetings How can we get away with using these screens for the next few years while everyone else is using hole punch I know lets use software to turn the cutout into a feature
Why didnt he talk about the battery
554 how is Spotify looking like this 
Ordered my iPhone 14 pro max unfortunately it comes next Friday because I ordered a little too late but at least I dont have to wait til October because that is the current wait time Good luck to those who ordered later than I did
Always on or always watching to be exact They need light for the camera to see you They cant see you without any light
"got the motorala ad 3 times in a apple vid  YouTube bein sus asf rn 
Luv da vid  dat cam is worth da money"
This phone is over pricedNot worth the money Apple are asking for
Im upgrading from the 11 so thats cool
There will be a loss of image quality when using that crop zoom especially in low light situations
I got a 12 pro max last year months before the 13 launched still dont see a reason to upgrade but I think it would make sense if I sold mine before it gets too old and get a the new one I might do it in 23 months but for now Im cool
Song at 1940 
Just watched the fall movie and that text by satellite feature would have come in clutch
Best iPhone ever
I appreciate the honesty of it all Youre the best
Just crush test with a fake doll
Im still planning to upgrade this even though I know Ill have to clean the camera every time I take a selfie I have thicc thumbs
Not a word on battery life
Soits a rebranded notification bar
They made them so much more expensive in Europe and probably the rest of the world It felt like a huge f u to the rest of the world when they announced the phones were staying the same price
308 sorry guys i gotta stop the review its broken
They dont want to put a touch Id in a iPhone
so is it worth upgrading from 13 pro to the 14 pro i honestly am a fan of the dynamic island and obviously my fav color purple
Dynamic island also known as lg V20 secondary display
This phone makes all android phones seem out dated an slow an clunky There cameras have allways been the best in the smart phone game
That was probably the most beautiful intro for an iPhone youve done better than apples reveal
I think the battery life is due to iOS16 battery life seems to have taken a hit with that update
Its a shame that the 512 price went up by 250 this year
"The 14 series is just way too similar to the 13 series Almost nothing new

And Apple is so good with marketing they even got me excited for a split second for the 14 pro models until I compared the 2

Yeah dont get the ENTIRE iPhone 14 lineup Its all marketing trash

Wait for the 15 series"
Dynamic island is stupid because your camera will just have fingerprints all the time
My wife calls it the Kitchen Island
Bruh That intro
I see the dynamic island being another mac book function key scenario cool idea but eventually over time it will be scrapped for one reason or another
Is it worth it for 1800 USD   Base Model in India   I dont think so S 22 Ultra is priced 1000 USD
Dope intro 
1730 was waiting for him to bring up no USBC and we got it
Dynamic Island sounds cool But if you think about it too much it just seems like apple didnt want to bother with finding a way of eliminating the notch completely So they just covered it with some fancy tricks that im sure will be useful to some to make it seems like a feature Its pretty much software that any phone can do without having that pill at the top
Another mediocre improvement for the iPhone
Any link on the wallpaper
Apple people are so weird its an ugly cut out its not a feature It still makes watching full screen content or playing full screen games shit Bezels are still unforgivably outdated too
Ill get a new iPhone when I can get a decent picture of some stars
"Probably the most lackluster iPhone year I have ever seen The pill is so gimmicky youd be the the biggest idiot to get this phone for this Also camera was underwhelming you can tell we are really reaching the limits of iPhone 

They need to do something dynamic next year cuz this aint it"
That Apple Watch tan is legendary
237 maybe jerryrigeverything guy
Kinda booring
Marquess voice literally makes the video a hundred times better
ill wait for the 15 with usb c hopefully
becoz of satalite connectivity some movies should work without iphones especially for the kidnapping and struggling with no network twists
Why in the world should we buy hes hoodie
lg v20 
The Studio did an absolutely phenomenal job on that intro Absolutely stunning   
Main attraction of iPhone 14 pro is dynamic island what a joke  And AOD is another joke
Just put the phone inside the car which is being tested at NCAP facility You will know if crash detection works
Music link is broken
The idea of V10 and Galaxy S Continuum is separate screens This Dynamic Island on iPhone 14 Pro is screen on screen idea which makes the screen experience more fluid
30fps over 24fps 
Apple let other companies get past all their notch designs before doing theirs and working around it it might be hard for other companies to go back to that era and copy what Apple is just doing
If they have any sense no they wont copy a massive notch for some crap features
Your hands are so big I thought it was the mini version 357
That wallpaper tho 
"Removing Sim tray is so so Awkward 
What if i travel other country 

Apple focusing only for "
I would definitely turn off crash detection I dont want some jank b happening to me while Im on the road
"Seriously did apple real made it right with the iphone 14 You have got to be joking all their so could revolutionary features are so stone age tech nowadays or should i say apple really has been so incredibly great at scamming people

Mag Safe new feature you say Been in the market for ages ask alibaba or ebay You just havent heard of it prior to apples gimmicky introduction and it messes up your compass Does your iphone allow charging wirelessly other phones Mine does wired or wirelessly its decade old tech and yet apple have not figured yet how

You said apple is the only one who made a light indicator for privacy matters really Its been in existence for like ages ago

Dynamic Island Revolutionary or just a gimmick for a feature they havent out figured yet how to hide a camera under the display Why would you want a notch or a bigger than pill cut out on a screen when you can have seamless screen just like this which i call a disappearing blackhole

Always on display on iphone revolutionary Oh please tell that to my live AOD

Multitasking anyone I bet your iphone can do no such thing like this

2000 nits of brightness you say Lets say you put your iphone to that much brightness your iphone will throttle down because of the heat it will be producing in just a few minutes ask other iphone users Iphones are incredibly incredibly incredibly bad at heat management And oh mine also has what you call super brightness so really not something to brag about

True apple may have added some very new features like the satellite texting and car crash SOS but thats just about it and its not a feature that youd be wanting to try out for yourself anytime soon right If you know what i mean

For all of Apples gimmicky marketing their iphones should only be priced  13 of their asking price really Old tech after all Probably same as a class B phone brand Their asking price for the new iphone is really Far out literally Their best phone is already nearing the price range of a Foldable phone of yeah i forgot to mention im using SAMSUNG FOLD 3 its gonna beat the hell out of any iphone youve got there   Care to fold your phone in half anyoneapple fanboys  Ill let you borrow my hacksaw"
It is my understanding Crash Detection only works when the iPhone detects its being used inside a car ie connected to your infotainment similarly to Do not Disturb while driving so technically it cannot trigger accidentally just by falling down or even if you launch it against a wall with a T shirt cannon
"It makes sense to have the multitasking features out of reach of the fingers If the dynamic island was at the bottom of the phone people would keep triggering it accidentally

That said I think that the intention wasnt to design a new multitasking feature but to make use of the new design in the best possible way"
I feel that Apple has been working on a new display front and back throughout the past few years Agreed the phone has been looking the same for almost 4 years now but think about what they did from iPhone 48 123 look similar too 5 models I believe next year they would be changing the look of the phone just as they did with the X
The apple way
Looking for an upgrade from the s9plus
As long as the AOD is optional and can be turned off I think its a non factor
iphone 11 or later me with my xs 
I just wished those phones wouldnt cost a fortune in europe Im going to slow down my upgrade cycle to compensate for a starting price of 1449 in germany for the pro max
308 heart attack moment 
Why do you think that the tap and long press features of the Dynamic Dsland are backwards   should be swapped I dont really understand the gripes on this and The Verge review was the same Before the Island we had to tap the green and blue bubbles in the top left corner beside the notch on older iPhones and that opened the app Why is this any different Similarly long pressing on UI elements in iOS has generally displayed more options and controls which is what a widget is for
Another great MKBHD video I have the 13 Pro but Im selling that to a friend for the same 600 Apple was going to give me for a trade in and my 14 Pro Purple 256gb should arrive tomorrow Im retired military so with the 600 sale of my 13 Pro 256gb and the 100 military discount the 14 Pro is only costing me 448 Thats worth it for me
Thanks Marq for brute honesty People with 13 Pro Max wont even blink at these gimmicks
Great video Marques just a quick question though would you recommend upgrading from a 13 mini to a 14 Pro
The hole on the display Wtf
How will the always on display fair in terms of burn in since its like the whole screen is on
Great video  I think folks with an iPhone 11 or older would benefit with the upgrade like Marques said but in no way do I feel like I need the upgrade from my 13 Pro  Honestly I think Im not budging until they bring USBC ports into the iPhone  The 48MP camera is a gimmick as its still really a 12MP final pic for most users  Dynamic Island is a cool concept but it didnt really make it a game changer  iOS 16 is great and Im very happy with the features on my current phone  Love the customizable lock screens and changes they made to the notifications  You dont need the 14 to see those updates  Heres hoping the iPhone 15 finally brings the USBC port so it doesnt take forever to get a video off of the iPhone
what about when u accidentally dropped your phone out of ur vehicle
I really dont like how they dont include a charger in the box I know its nothing new to stop including accessories in boxes and I do have so many extras lying around but I cant make a helmet out of chargers if they dont keep giving me free chargers
How can noSIM tray be legal in the EU
Cant wait for mfs to hack satellites cos the iphone got satellite connectivity
Thumbs up for iOS16
1047 it makes sense because its like the other icons on my Home Screen Tap opens the app Long press opens some options and shortcuts and things I can do
Bruh as if apple dont copy Samsung till this day especially with this notch
It better be the new GR Corolla 
Its 1100 for a slab phone with what animations on the notch no reverse wireless charging and some fancy lockscreen widgets Yay
No 8k video Yet the LG V60 does hmmm
I go to the Philippines a lot and iv never had a problem with not changing the SIM card always just let carrier know and used roaming and never had problems dont see the reason for people getting mad especially because its Philippines and most people cant afford a phone plan and just load there phones every so often
Speaking of 305 every time Im getting busy my apple watch thinks Im doing an elliptical work out and always gives me the amount of time I have lasted  Then I can show the wife it was in fact longer than 3 minutes because 5  3
yo break the phone on purpose and then taking it to a iphone shop
eSIM isnt new either The samsung galaxy s3 sprint version didnt have a sim card slot
Is it possible for individual apps to have separate notification sounds It unfortunate that all apps notifications are the same Well except the Xbox app
Bro that chevron hoodie looks dope
you amazing
can i get the wallpaper from the first scene
Not gonna lie while watching the apple keynote for 1phone 14pro and they showed off the dynamic island I was like that is genuinely genius an excellent way to actively blend the cutout with the interface Im surprised no one else thought of this or did they
Tbh this was boring
Luv u man
320 I think it might be an issue if u go to a theme park
Beautiful intro
Amazing overview and review like always My entire family has Iphones and everything I really wish I had one of these as does my gf and she wants me to get one for facetime and Imessage so Im really thinking about switching but I have had android for so long Really hope you do a give away I would absolutely love to win and finally give an Iphone a try Keep up the amazing reviews so detailed as always  Everyone stay blessed and healthy
Crazy that the intro is not an actual apple commercial
When is Apple going to get rid of the notch
Was that bon iver tune in the intro 
It did get copied Xiomi released their mini dynamic islinad alr
Upgrade my iPhone 12 Mini to iPhone 14 Pro
Those intros are getting out of this world I would buy the iPhone just because of your intros thats just pure masterpiece
"i think he forgot to tell your front camera will be dirty all because of dynamic 
also when you watch video that notch look more bad then the old one"
Bro just dropped the phone
Love the introooo
Why Most gnes are trying to get rid of the hole so why would they stick anything next to something t hats not there
"hopefully next year 
astrophotography and periscope usb type c if not ill wait for them"
Dynamic Island  a way for people to show others they have the newest iPhone Its Cosmetic Clout
Whats wrong with your knee
Hahaha needs to be copied   androids users and the innovation
RIP LG  Never gets enough credit for their innovation that didnt go anywhere
So basically he politely said we dont need this phone Another year with my 11 it is
888K views in 2 hours 
i prefer samsung always screen
Satellite connectivity will be a game changer for not only adventure people but cross country drivers many cell dead zones still in US crash protection is cool also its like personal onstar no matter the vehicle camera will be interesting to see if its a major boost or not but so far looks good that front display and dynamic functions are what apple is known the tight integration and fluidity between software and hardware wasnt planning on upgrading iphone 12 pro till next year but the new hardware an software integration features make the 14 pro a different phone
Great conclusive video as always 
personally im just disappointed with the lack of innovation and the design seems stupid on the dynamic island if you use it your selfiecamera will always have fingerprints all over it impacting the quality of it its a cool feature but stupid design
Have 13 pro wont be upgrading
Its just another giant notch with extra steps
Chevron hoodie ROCKS
like the AOD copied by Apple  Right 
T eu aqui no Brasil assistindo essa recomendao sem entender nada de ingls mas admirando o novo iPhone que espero em breve poder conseguir ter o meu
Bro not Testing anything thats so black of you MKBHD
1253 curious if the fingerprints makes it into your selfies
MKBHD with 20SYL is so nostalgic
why the f they would leave a tiny little gap between the front camera cutout and the edge
Was look I forward to this
Its a cop he used the damn phone camera in the video
Does pro has 120 hz refresh rate
Im not a big fan of your content but your one of the most professional presenters all media combined You could work anywhere I would be surprised that head hunter havent tried to recruit you for broadcast As for the content as a photographer iPhone 14 Pro Max is a game changer Not because it will replace pro mirrorless cameras but how fast its evolving and how much closer its getting to replace prosumer DLSRs or mirrorless Thats not to say seeing this that someone like Canon wont step up and move forward much faster to win the race Canon actually have technology available to go to production years in advance The release is governed by marketers who only release in response to competitors
dirty front camera  10
Im using iPhone 7plus considering to upgrade 14 or wait for the 15
Ay have you heard anything about the  galaxy note if they coming out with a new one
i stay with my iP 12 PRO MAX till iP 15 PRO Max
Im confused about the cinematic mode comment The complaint was that it ran at 1080p30 and that was dumb NOW it runs at 4k24pwhich is what everyone wanted
MKBHD with chapters Love it
They should make the tap vs hold on the dynamic island a custom user settings
Its A GimmickPlain And Simple
"I dont see the point of upgrading from last years or even the 12 since they look the same and only the internals and display and camera is the only thing that slightly changes
I dont think iPhones are that innovative as other devices on the Market thats why I switched from an iPhone"
"The photos look way too processed that sharpening effect kills the photos for me
The new Xperia looks a lot more like a professional camera imo

Makes it seems like a low quality JPEG 
Miss the days when iPhones had natural look photos"
I have it preordered This will be my first iPhone ever after rocking android since forever and my current daily driver is getting a little long in the tooth after 4 years of use The ecosystem I own an iPad for creative purposes and all those conveniences that an iPhone provides tipped me over the edge so Im looking forward to it Would love to hear a little bit more about the battery life but Ill turn the always on display off just in case
RIP LG They had such cool phones
Thank u for ur explanations examples and visuals Greatly appreciated so we can see and now know the difference with the new iPhone 14 pros etc
I am just wondering  how the phone itself will survive if one is involved in a car crash
The most underrated  useful feature would be the battery percentage within the battery icon
"Me Watching video about iPhone
YouTube Plays a Samsung Flip ad"
Are the 14 and 14 pro 120 hz
Anyone that knows what widgets and wallpaper he has
landscape orientation dynamic island
Bottom line nothing new as usual   Dose not worh the upgrade
What is that black colored tesla item behind you Looks like a surf board or a missile
Last thing I would care after a car crash is to turn off that notification on the phone Imagine the police swamped in minor accidents across the world
Taking a limitation and making it an offer people cant refuse  Dynamic Island
An amazing video as always Which calendar widget are you using on the lock screen
"Im gonna be testing an Airalo eSIM tomorrow for my trip to Scandinavia I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max that already has my main tmo eSIM and an empty SIM tray

If the dual eSIM with Airalo works thatll give me confidence to take my soon to arrive 14 Pro Max on international trips "
Dynamic island is something first step of machines being human like or sth like that
So you are encouraged to smudge ur selfie camera  looks cool tho
Watching MKBHDs iPhone review on my very own iPhone for the first time
why no body talking about how the iphone 14 has old design  design should have been same for the the models  not everyone can push their limit to buy pro
The dynamic island is a cool feature but I cant see that being the one feature thats gonna make people run out and buy the iPhone 14 The thought of constantly touching the camera and smudging it makes me dislike it slightly
I think its time to upgrade from my 7 plus to the 14 pro max lol
It looks amazing and supper innovative deliver solutions not features 
The notch face id unlocking need to change
iPhone 10 im chillin 
too many fucking ads
My goodness that Intro 
Fuck the new iPhone Marquess content has consistently been growing
Marques is hands down the best and most consistent reviewer on this platform Ive been watching for years and Im just in awe of how he continues to push the bar
"It still has that giant ugly notch What an eyesore

It seems the future is all about reducing portability  mobility Were expected to pay ever higher prices for reduced features no headphone jack no earbuds no charger no SD card slot  now theyve removed the friggin SIM slot  

Their laptops are no stranger to this reduction Theyve reduced  of ports  CDDVD player Pass Ill keep using Samsung"
I work in mobility for my company and all of the phones are carrier locked anyways so eSIM prohibiting the use of another carriers SIM card whether domestic or foreign wont be a big issue I see far more carrier discounted devices being purchased than unlocked devices Also most international carriers should be able to provision an iPhone now using its EID number The user just has to be logged onto WiFi to activate an eSIM
"Love how I got a 9 minute iPhone ad while watching this review
Great work btw"
Dont feel like its a good idea to keep touching the front camera to acess the island
I like marquess reaction pretty much says eh its alright
I live in Poland and the problem is 14 Pro Max starts from 1500 USD If it would cost the same as in States I would definately buy it
I mean this is cool and all but honestly I want the notch GONE and adding features like this just means its going to stick around longer 
Yep iiiii said it  and you just did too about the E SIM cards how about for people that need to go out of town or they have businesses out of town and they need to switch phones and switch SIM cards they cant do it anymore so thats to me seems like a lot of people are not going to update to the new iPhone 14 and just stick with their 13s or 12s or whatever mainly because of that
Daaamn that intro
Why does the intro look so lores
I feel like even if we get USBC on an iPhone itll be part of a 2 year transition to make it USB 3 speeds So rather Apple add USB 3 speeds on the lightning port like we had on the 1st Gen iPad Pro
Once again Apple is starting a new trend even if LG is the first to do it lol
The island boys need royalties from Apple for copy right infringement 
Please talk about that iphone pro 14 is 1000 just in US In Europe everything is more expensive by 20 
Apple gambled with its always on display approach Keeping clock and other icons in the same location for a long period of time increases the screen burnin risk drastically Lets see how many complaints we see after a year of use
453 
Apple doesnt innovate 15 years from now theyll suffer the same fate as Nokia
I decided to upgrade to the 14 pro this year Im coming from the XS and my phone is finally starting to show its age specially in the battery department
been waiting for this
Give me one iphone
Im upgrading to the 14 pro max from iPhone XS Max My wife is getting the regular 14 proc coming from an 8 So big upgrades for us
I think what Apple has been selling for iPhone is its software side I used to hate it because they release the same phone every year but I realize their software side and ecosystem is well refined afaik I guess even the old ones are still being used by people after so many years
Has anyone concerned over the burnin on the AOD I mean it is dimmed down okay But will this cause more burnin
Whole budget on intro
1489 in italy 14 pro max
I truly believe you have some of the most professional and high quality content out there marques Im not even going to buy an iphone and i still find it very enjoyable
Whatever youre paying the guy who does these graphics it isnt enough 
Ill be switching from my note ultra 20 and trying
Of  all the tech channels MKBHD has like the best animations and transitions lol Big up bro
"0 Innovations 
100 Dynamic Island"
Havent heard him use that intro song in a long while
"Im wonder which satellites will it be communicating with 
If it can communicate with satellites and have the power to do that why it doesnt communicate with emergency land stations also 
This system is half baked at best"
Bro youre a giant 50 feets above the floor Took forever for the phone to reach the floor
"ProRAW just means not having that over processed look with wayyy too much sharpening

Ill take that any that and compress it back to 12MP thank you very much "
Shout out to the V10  The design was amazing  I wish more phones looked like that
Marquees has been so loyal to using Altta for his music intro
Cant wait for the AirPod Pro 2 review
Great Videolike always Im waiting for mine on Friday to compare it with my Z Fold 4
man you and your team has the best production videos ever you guys really make this vids so good
The amount of Gs experienced in a car accident are very anomalous Id think the g sensor is a crucial criteria in detecting a car accident
"Something that no one talks about for some reason
The dynamic island is a cool design solution for the screen cutout but it has a significant drawback compared to the old notch  you are literally FORCED to touch the front camera you will have to wipe it much more often than before"
Full color AOD like that is definitely a battery drain especially if it is an OLED display like who needs to see their wallpaper at 1 brightness The pixel devices AOD does similar animations with transitioning from the lock screen to the AOD and does it better IMO
I gotta an iphone 8 do you recommend me to buy new
As per your tittle of vids said  if they are good ppl will copy  Thats when you know you are reallyyyy goood 
"Samsung 4 years ago  Forget the notch  meet infinity O display
Now Apple   Forget both notch and infinity O  meet the dynamic island 
After sometime Xiaomi  Forget all of them  meet our new blah blah blah island "
Maybe a video explaining how to tell which camera is giving which resolution It is hard for me to know how I would know that I am actually using the right camera to get the 48 megapixel resolution Most times I am using the wide or close up lenses and I am assuming that those would not get that resolution It is just confusing It is just a video idea Thanks
125  Look into zip hoodies as most people tend to find a pullovers too constrictive around the neck and too much of a commiment like once its on its on for the day
Honestly Im really happy with them taking the current design and just making it better I think the iPhone nails it in so many fundamental categories for how we use a phone that some flashy new feature that doesnt quite fit would sour the experience Its also the same price which accounting for inflation makes it about 58 less than last years model I love androids innovative crowd and am thankful for them beta testing the next apple invention 
"me watching MKBHD review of iPhone 14 Pro
me already preordered iPhone 14 Pro last week"
U should do a video on 2 in 1 laptops Dont think Ive seen a lot of info on that out there
The only reason I dont have an Iphone is because its still not using USB C
Dynamic island is definitely more functional than the notch but in my opinion its even more invasive than the notch I dont think smartphone manufacturers will copy this feature The whole idea is to get as much screen real estate as possible and the dynamic island is in the opposite direction of that goal My 12 Pro Max works perfectly fine I dont see this year as worth it for an upgrade not until we at least get USBC
The need to put back everything in the box cause it useless buying everything separate
They have been working from home and it shows
Thanks for reminding about the lg v10 I remember how cool that phone was when it came out Its sad how lg couldnt survive in the smartphone industry
I cant beleive my eyes no Big YouTuber has yet to make a video review about Samsung Galaxy Z fold 4 not even mr whose the boss hell he didnt even made 2 videos like marquess did on Z fold 4 he did made Z flip 4 do these YouTubers dont like Z fold 4
Nice touch with dynamic island on the globe in the back
Me waiting for iphone 14 to release so that iphone 13 gets cheap and iphone 12 gets cheaper so that i can buy i phone 11 
Awesome Phone Ever
real subtle flexing that you got your wordle in 3 marques D
Whistlin Diesel will so test it
Wanna buy list
Thankfully none of the android phones these days feature such horrid screen cutout I am sure it will be super distracting to watch movies Having said that Apple has embraced their shortcomings rather than try to hide it like the android phones did early on in terms of screen cutout Both Android and iOS have  adopted features from one another in the past and should continue to do so albeit with different aesthetics  But I am still not sure how the dynamic island is going to hide that ugly cutout during watching multimedia content other than that they exclude the whole top part from the cutout from the viewing area That would be a shame considering these phones cost so much money I am big fan of their ipad and mac books pros and a regular user but I cant quite justify their vision for the iphone pro models
1643 is this the same as Samsungs super steady
"922 
Bet you 1000 next year theyll make it in an i shape just to be abble to say theyve  now extended the display Like never before
Mark my words Every major phone company Holds back on hardware upgrade and desings because they wouldnt have anything to change next year"
One thing I think worth mentioning is that they just slightly changed the dimensions so that you need to buy all new cases despite using 999 similar design Its really unfortunate that apple who supposedly cares about the environment continues to do this Cases are rarely recycled and used 2nd hand they also have no utility outside of the phone they are with contributing to tons of plastic waste Its high time phone companies cared about this If youre going to recycle design at least think of the planet when you do it
Nice promo as per usual Marques
would yall say that I should upgrade my XS Max to the new 14 pro max like is it worth it
Love the introduction epic
Mkbhd hoodie looks like a honeybee priest  who drank red dye
Hideous phone Im out Auto dislike 
When I first saw it though how dumb is that Not sure how much Id use it or if dynamic island is in the way
The intro is freaking awesome
Soo basically the display widgetlike notch should have been in the iphone 13 
Was there a special turn the island into a notch setting for reviewers
So did Apple copied the dynamic island from LG I thought its an innovation what a copycats are at Apple
I would consider this as an upgrade to my iPhone X but it starts at 1300 in Germany So basically 30 more and thats a whole other league Still havent made a decision yet if this or a refurbished 13 Pro
Ill keep my 13 pro
The intros are getting dope
Why would someone get the iphone 14 its so similar to the 13 pro feels like they just made the 13 pro again Any thoughts
I hate Dynamic Island but I fear people will love it just cause its apple People have been eating Apples ass for the bare minimum which is why theyve barley innovated since the X Soon people will be calling other folks broke for having a notch instead of the DI too
Whats the airport code for that dynamic island Id like to take a vacation there
iPhone 15 will be better in cam
It would be a great comparison if you took photos and videos on the 13 pro and 14 pro of the same thing I would like to see the difference
iphones have became boring
where do you get these wallpapers
As an Iphone 8 user the 14 pro is going to be one of my best investments of the year Night and day it should feel like
"iPhone 14 Pros arent available to public as of this moment Dynamic island theme on MIUI has been since a day or two ago
This has already been copied

Edit HE MENTIONED IT MKBHD DOESNT LET ME DOWN"
after how many taps on the pill do you think front camera images will start getting blury
that wallpaper  where can i get it
BRUH youre completely right LG did the concept of Dynamic Island with the V10 I completely forgot about that phone
They take that much away from the phone they maybe no phone at all in the future lol
Ill buy apple again when they make true notchless full display 
LMAO if ntheyre so worried about water just seal up the SIM card tray Everyone else does This is the same as Apple removing the headphone jack because they say It makes the phone more waterproof by removing it Next thing Apple will start removing buttons because it makes the phone more waterproof or whatever theyll say about it lol
but price
Correction 1500 in most countries
would love a video on why you prefer 30fps over 60 or 24 cos i have no idea lol
Im looking forward for iphone 15 pro  Not upgrading this yearpreety sure im getting the airpods pro 2
8 years later Apple comes up with Dynamic Island  Android chat bubbles for the notch
That intro song its the best
Mmmmmm nice keyboard man
Stop buying the new iPhone
Basically the same thing as an iPhone 13 Pro nothing new
"Throw the iPhone with full force on a  cushion wall and simultaneously start a car crash video with blasting sound
Then you can test the crash test alert"
It will be either be copied by everybody or it can become exclusive to 14 pro series only just like the home button iPhones
What about rolling shutter since its a bigger 48mp sensor
I Still have the 11Pro cant wait for this upgrade Love the mat black Tesla Surf board
The sooner you release your rant on lightning the sooner they will listen maybe
no way im paying that much for a phone with a 60 hertz display
I am not even sure if others will have a notch or pill shape cutout in 1824 months
This is what apple fans get excited about now 
The music at the beginning is the same as the iPhone 10s unboxing I remember it because I was so hyped up for that video of yours Brought some memories back 
"What kind of review is that without testing the NEW features never seen before No satellite no crash test Just showing colors and showing the notch
How stupid Marcus How stupid I pass on this one"
I missed that intro song so much 
yeah id rather have a full screen display with a slight larger chin
i think imma buy this
why the hell they are still using Lighting port and not USB C Apple is using USBC in other products like ipad  Macbook but why they still going with slow lighting port I am sure they will bring USBC in their future iphones perhaps next year Iphone 15 and will advertise as something huge This is ridiculous On one hand they talk about minimising the carbon foot print  but they still want to use that specific slow lighting cables and ports In present world when most of the phones and the laptops are coming with USBC these guys are still on lighting 
1430 finally a real life shot of using a phone in a situation we all use it too often
Youre right they gonna try to copy but they will fail Apples software implementation is unmatched
You are basically the Apple of youtube reviews
Waiting for the pixel 7 iphone 14 what a let down even my huawei p40 pro was smoother
Bringing back that intro I love it
I feel like removing the SIM tray and going to ESIM was probably one of the largest steps back any company has done in a long time I used to sell phones back when there was no removable SIM card for the phones that I was selling for Sprint They didnt have the option like TMobile or ATt to have removable SIM card at the time It was a giant pain in the ass and like pulling teeth getting somebody to set up the correct international stuff on the account and then have it work when it actually gets over to wherever the person is going Having people travel from other countries into the US who came into the store asking to get a phone with a removable SIM card tray because a phone they wanted wasnt available in their country and they wanted to buy one while they were here They couldnt do that they had to be sent to ATt or TMobile this will be very interesting to see play out because I think itll be one of those one and done things Apple try it once see it backfired and wont do it again
mkb so disappointed he never picked up the iphone after dropping it 
Bro these intros are fcking insane
Dont you get fingerprints all over your front cameras from using the dynamic island
Holding out for the pixel 7 pro
1100 dollars but EU 1499 Euro wtf Apple 
Okay satellite connectivity is greatbut the question is since you will not be using it everyday how often you will recall that your phone has a satellite connectivity that to in panic situation  you can send a msg via satellite
Nice review as always But honestly it is so lame to have bad battery life with Always On display Im using Pixel 6 with always on display and i did not have a chance to kill its atomic battery even once in 2 months of having it It always 2040 left before sleep Apple should do single colour dark Always On display and the battery will be not affected badly I think they will come up with this solution eventually My GF uses iPhone so i hope one day i can test Dynamic Island Bad that front camera will always have fingerprints on it tho
Just watch Google make their own version of the dynamic island and watch Android devices especially Samsung start copying that on their phones I can guarantee it will happen soon
can we get a 14 review asap
sorry but still not purchasing this gona wait till the notch is completely gone
Didnt talk much about the battery How was the battery life
1505 that dog is so cute
apple guru
Actually people need to really know the difference between Always on Display and Always on Text in terms of expectations
When will the day come when I can afford to buy this phone
Im here for the new camera system 4K in Cinema Mode
Yes thanks for mentioning YouTube music 
Hows the focus distance for macro compare I was surprised that the focal point was farther with my iPhone 12 compared to my 10 when I upgraded Hope the 14 Pro Max can focus closer than the 12 Pro Max
"I want this wallpaper on my iPhone 
Where can I get it"
Ngl the dynamic Island looks pretty cool
Il donne vraiment envie de passer du 11pro au 14 pro Pas trop de nouveaut mais assez pour sauter le pas
This is my first time getting an iPhone I think its worth it for new customers
As an international traveller I am pretty disppointed I was going to upgrade from 11 pro to 14 pro this year But lookin at this phone I might just pick 13 pro at a lower price
Thats dynamic IslandWhen u said its taken from LG V10 just as I speculated
hideous design as always
 on the phone is so distracting 
Always on display should have just been a iOS 16 update
What about 14
I think the dynamic island wont catch on since its at the top of screen so it will be a hard reach with one hand
"As for USBC on an iPhone Apple would prefer you spend your money on a USBC iPad instead 

If you just have an iPhone and you have tons of photo and video and you dont want to use iCloud probably cuz youll probably bust through your iCloud storage  and you rather not pay for more iCloud the thought alone of using the lightening port to backup all your pictures and videos to a Mac or PC would be so terrifying youd prefer taking all your pictures with a USBC iPad do you could back up to a Mac or PC thereby avoiding iCloud almost completely"
I dont like how it looks too obstructive
I would know
I have a iPhone 12 should I upgrade Part of me just wants to get the iPhone 14 plus but idk
Keep my note 20 ultra or get one of the two iPhone 14 pro max or galaxy fold 4
Floss
your videos 
Definitely bored with Apple products
The notification center doesnt show notifications in sleep mode on IOS 16 which really sucks
I just need to see you in person with a phone in your hand to know that its a NEW PHONE
One thing Im worried abt is the blurred and cloudy selfies youre gonna get because of all the smudges on the front cam lol Youll need to wipe every single time
Mkbhd i love everything that you do love your work but can you please stop saying lowkey because its getting annoying
Still on a 12Pro Max and its working like a champ Maybe 15 Pro will be worth the upgrade Thanks for the review though
Interesting at 1132 the orange mic indicator when to the right of the battery icon instead of in the island Good I hate its called an island
MKBHD with the quality reviewYESSS
i always get white iphones but that black and darkish purple look so nice im stuck between which color is nicest
2000 unread emails wtf bro
same camera as the pro max
sorry its still tshirt and shorts season
Is there a way to turn on the always on display in specific places or at specific times There must be a focus mode or a Siri setting you can mess around with
why didnt they implement a notification led feature with the pill or would that be a third partys responsibility for example whats app notification can use a green led blink feature around the pill
Would screen protectors cause problems with dynamic island UI
Im glad you have a shoutout to TylerStalman He definitely doesnt get enough credit
As a developer I wouldnt invest too heavily into that punchhole since its temporary I understand that Apple did the AoD better than every other Android manufacturer but I wouldnt wait 9 years for this
Crash detection that Google pixel phones has had for years
Is the front facing camera gonna be all finger greasy now
YOUR INTROS NEVER DISAPPOINTTheBestByFar
the dynamic island makes it feel like there is no notch at all its pretty insane how well they integrated it into the ui
why it have black circle on the screen
Does it still dim automatically when youre outside for a long time when your phone is on max brightness I hate when it dims and i cant get it brighter and my phone says max brightness is on
Honestly was waiting for this review
Will Be Copied nah even chine corporations remove chin from phone
"Maybe the Chinese manufacturers like Xiaomi Vivo etc might copy it But I dont see Google and Samsung copying this There is literally no reason for them to do so Sure it looks cool and funky but it make zero sense in practical use

 Its at the top Bad for onehand use
 Smudges Youre having to constantly touch it because its interactive Youll have to clean it all the time WellI guess thats what the microfiber cloth is for Lol
 Its still hideous when watching videos

And that implementation of AOD makes no sense We need to stop giving Apple a pass for doing things that dont make sense We keep calling it the Apple way even when we know other manufacturers will get ripped apart for doing the same things"
"I got a phone less than 2 weeks ago I was talking to the dude about SIM card slots and how I expect Apple to get rid of them in order to fuck over the consumer and try and limit the user AGAIN 

Tickle me pink I am either a genius or Apple fans are dumb for always falling for this crap and in turn forcing other brands to follow suit and in turn screw the consumer over across the board AGAIN

The ONLY reason tyo be with Apple is for the security they provide in case the cops are trying to get in to your phone AKA for criminals lmfao"
"The dynamic island thing  although it probably has some good points  at the same time  Im thinking people are now going to be randomly tapping on it putting finger prints all over the face ID  sensors and selfie cam  its going to be a pain in ass cleaning it all the time 
  Re the always on display  there are so many different versions on Android  my old Galaxy S8 always on display works like an old Windows screen blanker that every 20 or 30 seconds moved to a different location on the screen"
Apple  were innovative we found crash detection
Another great review from MKBHD and I fckin love that intro 
"This will be copied but Apple cant copy few basic things from Android

ios sucks big time 3 months ago I have purchased 2 iphone 13s Thought of giving iphone a try after using android for 10 years

 Security sucks on iOS We all know how many times icloud and macos has been hacked No lock exist without keys
Been using internet since 1999 Stopped purchasing  installing security softwares during launch of Windows Vista My saying is if 1 knows what he or she is doing on the internet they dont need a security software Been visiting so many underground websites and downloading cracks  dlls but never ran into security issues
 What I have found is that ios is a joke and an iphone is a dumb down device It doesnt have some of the basic features
 Cant record calls
 The biggest joke is cant block SMS  text from senders without numbers So be ready all the movers to get spam messages i usually get 10 minimum spam messages from bank finance groups etc Its pathetic and painful to delete The filter option is useless and block feature doesnt works at all unless the sender has number and is in your contact list Cant use third party messaging app such as google messages
 Audio panel is another joke in ios cant do multitasking Such as I cant play clash royale and take an incoming call at the same time If i low down a volume the volume goes down for the game and call at the same time Its seriously a joke Android lets the user lower the volume of an individual app
 Credit card  debit card  option are disabled in India Cant use it any app store Its seriously another joke To purchase anything in app store 1 needs to add money to apple wallet adding money to apple wallet is another headache and extra step
 There are very few apps in app store compared to play store
 The prices are different and plenty of times higher in app store compared to play store
 In app ads are long and at time freeze and have to rewatch it
 Apps staying in memory is a lie plenty of apps dont
 Apps not crashing is a lie plenty of apps crash from time to time In fact apples default apps crash from time to time Check recent reviews of any apps created by apple and you will come to know the truth about how stable apple is
 At time getting simple task done on apple requires an extra step and its frustrating
 Itunes is necessary for windows gaming users or ordinary windows users
 Its not a plug and play device
 Cant install apps from unknown sources at times its required for office purpose
 Plenty of features do not work as they are intended to do such as screen minimizing
 When shared a live location the feature is not working on the receivers end Maybe they need apple maps or iphone as well
 The imessage additional feature send with effects doesnt works even when the receiver has same phone and is using same version os and app
 Call history oh my this is the feature which I wish to get combination of Android and ios Its good that I get to see calls from all the voice applications in call history so that I dont have to go into app and check if anybody called me on Teams vonage etc I really like that feature in iOS but at the same time its still horrible I mean Androids call history is far better and advanced one
 Hotspot turns off automatically that is 1 of the pathetic thing to happen Whenever the hotspot is turned on if we do not connect a device in seconds the hotspot automatically turns off At times by the time we connect the other device to iphones hotspot iphone automatically turns it off and we have to switch it on again Also the blutooth turns on automatically every night
 The last but not least where every one brags is the camera I dont give a s for the camera features Its not going to make me look like Hritik Roshan or Tom Cruise The youtubers speak about colour accuracy But they wont tell you that it depends on 2 parties 1 is the capturer and 2 is the viewer If the viewer has different device or color profile the color wont be accurate to the viewer Cell phones can never come even close to a dedicated camera The fact is that they are never going to get any better unless they increase the size of the lenses

Youtubers push iphones because of the ads the viwers cant ignore ads like they can in an Android

Android is an Android and its going to take ages for an Iphone to catchup"
speakin of island  you have one growing on your headscalp
Oh I wanted the lack of USBC rant Thatll keep me waiting another year
"Already used LG v10

Apple always copies and names it as a biggest innovation"
Team Apple Unite
Bro galaxy does this tf he talking about lol
Rollercoasters especially launch coasters could be a problem for the crash detection on the brake run
Ok but does the pill cut into youtube vids at the aspect you use
I feel like the advertising on this is ridiculous Im getting board with Apple because I want to do more things with it The safety stuff is okay but I dont buy a house just because it has a fire extinguisher
How can I get this wallpaper Its cool 
looks way too much like an s10 dot but with apple logo on
I will never buy a iPhone bcz it is expensive but I watch all the reviews 
Great content as usual Did I hear you mention that you record these videos with an iPhone
Marques never disappoints but have been watching his videos since 2014 superb introduction 
Fun Fact just like the apple stage event this video also talks about cameras for 6 mins 10 secs  thats almost 33 of this video Well done MKBHD 
Well done lgand well done Samsung
"Isnt AlwaysOnDisplay something which is not in trend anymore
Like my current and previous phones had it I never use it because why"
Siri not on the notch
Almost a million views in less than 4 hours  Arent you the true GOAT of this stuff 
This hoddie looks exactly like the Egyptian flag lol 
Anyone else just want to wish Marques luck with physical therapy for his knee
Link to the wallpaper
I d love to have the ability to turn on the pixels of the notch between the selfie camera and the Face ID sensors it still blinks green to show if your camera is in use so why shouldnt those pixels work while watching a landscape YouTube video
charge ur phone
can you give a try on bumper cars and seee if it works
Excellent review
Meh I was waiting for iphone 14 to upgrade however now I am pretty sure Ill by the iphone 13 in a discounted price and use it until Apple actually come up with something innovative
Marcus talks about rumors on the podcast but they still send him a phone early without  blacklist Props
in conclusion keep 12 pro max for at least one more year
That intro is   
Wow did they actually do something to improve the repairability of iPhone That is nice though
I literally felt the smell of fresh new Hoodie 124  What is wrong with me 
The new Stacy Malibu 
Let me guess the Iphone 15 will have a slightly better display a slightly better camera and a slightly longer battery life And the Iphone 16 will have a slighlty better display a slightly better camera and a slightly longer battery life And the Iphone 17 will have a a slighlty better display a slightly better camera and a slightly longer battery life Amd the Iphone 18 will have something brand new curved edges Lol
All I can say is with that lockscreen give or take 23 years later screen retentionscreen burn is gonna take over your display
Apple users will be the first to get the implant you can tell smart phones for the in crowd have hit there peek
254 My watch thinks I am doing an elliptical workout when I play trombone lol
whos ready to tap their selffacing camera lens
Man the iPhone transfer speeds really make me dislike the iPhone I take a lot of photos of my work for social media and my website etc and I like to do graphics and things on my computer obviously and it takes ages to dump photos to the computer over lightning It almost makes breaking out my full frame faster all things considering
Trash name but great innovation for dead place
Mkbhd always predict right future  Others company will also copy iphone notch like they did before 
Dynamic Island is the 2022 version of what android has been doing with notifications bubbles and widgets forever
That hoodie definitely has a My Hero Academias All Might vibes lol
Im in the the nonpro iPhone is enough camp but honestly the Dynamic Island enough tempted me to upgrade not the cameras or display but the freaking pillshaped notch lmao
the only thing I like about the iphone is the ability to stop apps from tracking I find that moveable notch to look horrible
"Im confused how you can clearly tell the outlines of Face ID and the camera in bright light 

I thought OLED tech could completely turn off pixels to make that portion of the display true black"
It still has a notch is all I see Waste of money but people will buy it anyways
You better test crash detection I dont want see your name in obituary Safety is a must
They are really trying to get hired to film the next iPhone ad
Should I trade in my Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra for the iPhone 14 Pro Max
Its so innovative and new I cant wait to get my hands on this when it comes out got mine pre ordered 
Hey I bet no ones going to reply to me here but Im a bit sceptical that when Ill want the pill to be smaller it will just cut into my content more or am I being stupid
Yoooo I called it I mentioned LG V series doing this first
the pro is the one im gunnin for
what about a review of an iPhone 14  marquesBrownlee
Dynamic island
the island is so dumb having the island isnt dumb but forcing the you to have it because you put fake dead pixels where it isnt needed
"Apple Watch Ultra 800 and excellent headphones 
 But the iPhone 14 and its siblings are  very disappointed
 No screen hole no weight loss no LPDDR 5 no higher RAM no 2K screen no higher charging speed no higher ppi
 No more powerful telephoto no screen fingerprint no split screen
 Unfortunately Apple is years behind the rest of the companies and flash phones
 Design iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max
 Dragons are uglier than some
 And the best and most beautiful Apple offers a phone with one hole
 Like the rest of the flash phones and a fingerprint under a screen instead of all the slander notch and mustaches 
 Everyone buys a phone and an empty carton
 The first word he says is all right on Apple
 All because of Apple there is no charger no headphones no protection cover no memory card entrance 35 headphones socket or 2 SIM card inputs in most phones
 And like Apples battery it doesnt announce numbers including the battery capacity of its phones because the numbers are sloppy and few with the iPhone 13 Pro Max the battery is long
 But people need to know why and that Apples specifications and technologies are old and outdated and do not consume a battery like the rest of the high specifications of the rest of the flash phones
 The only iPhone screen among the real flakship phones from companies with a resolution of Full HD the rest of the flakes with a resolution of 2k and Sony with a resolution of 4k
 And LPDDR 4x instead of LPDDR 5 and many more
 Apple software does not contain a quarter of the features of Android phones especially Samsung phones
 Apple is living on an audience that is hidden lying and paying the drummers to polish its image and the company that pays the most for marketing the drummer
 2 billion dollars a year and people buy the majority out of love to show off a feeling of lack inside them
 This fact is crystal clear and every day about the day people know and make sure that Apple is No 1 in Aleppo users
 And cancer in the world of technology and everything is idle with technology for Apple to have a hand in"
One doubt in crash even mobile will get damaged right Then how come it will send SOS
Marques how do you live with 2800 unread emails And yes the Dynamic Notch is cute
Cant wait on next android phone I know they will have dynamic island
That the dynamic island is all that people talk about in this phone really tells you all about the current state of innovation speed in phones
I guess Im an island boy makes sense now
"iPhone 13 was already a very minor upgrade from the 12 
Now the 14 seems like an even smaller update 
I think most people should get the 13 Pro or 13 Pro Max as itll drop in price in the next 6 months"
Cool 
Wonder  how tap on notch would scroll up with dynamic island 
Xperia 1 IV vs iphone 14 pro camra comparision
Cause Im an island boy
Notch Pinhole and now Dynamic Island Apple always brands their version and try to take the stigma that was previously related away from it Touchscreen stylus Apple Pencil
Long live the Dynamic Island
Jerry Rig will test the crash protection feature in his hummer ev by rolling into a ditch with it most definitely
1822 that tan thoo
Honest trusted review no huge or innovative changes so unless youve an iPhone 6 or 8 theres no major need to upgrade unless youve that 1000 hole in ur pocket Ill hang on to my 12pro for at least another year
Ride the slingshot ride to test the crash
Can I upgrade my iphone 13 to thisI really like the island
even 200 dollar android phone have better always on display than this one
You saying youre not gonna test something makes me feel like youre definitely gonna test it lol  MKBHD in the deep woods
A 69 cameo everytime Battery percentage this time
definitely a tick upgrade as opposed to a tock waiting for iphone 15 before upgrading
Lol ok if they know who you are and see you taking photos they 100 knew
That is great phone  my problem is I aint gonna buy a new phone just because they made one  because  I dont use half the features on my current phone so dont need anything more because I dont use it  What percentage of the features do you use on your phone  Beautiful new hoodie
If you cant disable that stupid feature Im gonna be pissed The i looks so much better
An AOD that bright is just begging for screen burn
I have never had an issue with the notch its never bothered me so what they have done with the dynamic island I really think is stunning
That screen will be a total fuck up I had a friend who got a computer monitor with such huge nits and it literally heat so much it broke down in no time The reason why nobody want that bright screen is simple it drains stupid amount of battery as well as generates immense amount of heat Direct sunlight 100 brightness say bye bye to the phone
I want variables F or internal ND filter
I believe that If u put the iPhone in a bag and yeet the bag out its a pretty good way to know If the crash detection work as indeed
Whats the outro song
LG did the second screen ticker a while ago
Anyone know where he got the binary clock on the lock screen from
They NEEDED to add usb c
My brother actually said connecting airpods twice
A volleyball workout will always trigger fall detection on my watch when its turned on to your point about detection sensors etc
But did you kill that spotted lantern fly
Damn those circular studio light reflections on the first shot are rough surprised you didnt remove them in post 016
After 2 weeks with the phone none of you guys gonna be using dynamic island lol
All gimmicks They just change lipstick and charge you a grand for it That said Ill be getting one Upgrading from my IP6s 
"Magic pill makes more sense than the dynamic island 
Cuz it is a pill and definitely and addictive drug"
1300  or Euros in Germany 
This style of video felt fresh
Apple is giving 600 to trade in the 13 Pro so I thought 400 for the new 14 Pro was worth it Not going to care about the 400 for small upgrades in a couple months from now lol
Idk why you hate the name dynamic island so much I think its cute to think of it as an island than a dumb pill
 THE INTRO SONG FELT SO nostalgiac coz the intro was also used by LOGAN PAUL
Its already copied
"Microsoft We have basically removed the taskbar for Windows11 to make it more mobile friendly
Apple So we introduced task bar for iPhone
Microsoft Surprised Pikachu face"
And the question remains How about our oily fingers always around the front camera
I preordered the 14pro max Im upgrading from a 12 pro max that Ive had since the day it was released So about 2 years Ive had my phone and I think this will be a good solid upgrade Im not mad at apples technique of constant refinement rather than reinventing the wheel
a lot of the new features could have been deployed as a regular update figures
"Samsung Flip phone fold phone 
Apple Dynamic Island "
One bad thing I can see about the dynamic island is youd have to constantly wipe the selfie camera from fingerprints
This AOD transition was in Android 12L Now everyone is saying it unique 
Crash detection I am not gonna test that 
dynamic island is a genius name bc nobody likes saying it they are trying to kill the word Notch
This gives me 3D touch energy Its a great feature but will be gone in 2 years
I was just about to say didnt lg do that Android skins are like BMW they have lots of tech that years later come to regular cars 
The intro video featuring Iphone pro was so satisfying to watch Made a good kickstart to the whole video
His production quality is insane now  loved it
How did bro get it early
"Funny I saw so many post about how simple it is to do the dynamic island work that well And Im like sure buddy why dont you guys implement then 


Agree it looks simple but theres a lot going on"
What was that dotted widget on the left of his Lock Screen
I love how always on display turns off when it knows your not around or phone in pocket  Apple probably will not implement 8k bcos no 8k smartphone beats apples 4k so no need 
Island is just a cheap gimmick to fool customers
I definitely want to interact with the top of the screen very frequently using one hand on a huge screen if I were a member of the Hypermobility Syndromes Association HMSA This HypermobileDynamic Island seems to be a niche product
Im coming from a 12 mini so the 14 pro is gonna be great but if you have a 13 pro or just a 13 wait for the 15
My favorite reviewer broke my heart by not testing the two most amazing features the humankind have invented Please Marques I beg you take your car go to a stranded island and crash it to a huge rock so we can test Satellite and Car Crash
"The SIM card degrade really irked me As someone who likes to travel internationally getting a SIM card is such an easy and economical solution to expensive international fees by my carrier 
Seems like another improvement that will only end up costing consumers more"
Do I see a Window logo 1528 xD
"the new video design love it the recruits really doing there work looking forward for more studio videos 
keep it up"
Honestly Im here just for the intro
"Maybe android will copying soon

Back with Galaxy S10 notch design and then apply similar technology of the dynamic island"
Ha Sounds like you REALLY dont like this iPhone Tims gonna be mad with you for this one 
Who all paused at 1023  D D D
Slightly is the key of the i14 for sure
Nowadays Marques kinda become more advertiser rather than frank technobloger
Why comparison with low bionic  lol what a marketing by Apple ya dapple 
Will esim only setup allow for multiple cellular accounts at once Does the iPhone 13 esim capable of multiple cellular accounts as once
1322 hey u cant just say that and not show us the fottage cmon dude
I wish you brought up the point that architects say all the time if theres a flaw instead of hiding it you should emphasize it Apple clearly took this approach and thats why its a big deal and other people will copy it
how to Only review   show
Honestly Im happy there no stupid 100x zoom I want a phone if I wanted to look at the moon Id get a telescope because Samsungs phones use ai to make up the pictures taken of the moon its not actually a pic of the moon its the AI filling in the blurrys on the photo then you end up with a photo thats more AI then real moon
yo
i wonder how easily the front camera will get dirtyoily from all those taps
Look at this graph Nickleback starts playing somewhere
Friends dinamic island is a hole on the screenwhat we critizied on samsung phones Sudently now is better because is biger
I swear Marques is a legend What hes done with YouTube and reviews is nothing short of amazing
I am looking forward for a iphone flip next year
"1105 1113 glad to know it show connecting airpods XD thanks for telling us that twice Marques

edit please dont see this as we only see what you mistakes happen 
I love this channel and the other ones Maybe it even was intentional idk
I just think its funny so I mentioned it"
Hats off to the editor for the intro good job 
Ill upgrade my iPhone when they finally give me USB C 
Guess whos alone on the Island
This review could have been less than 8 minutes long Marquis is grinding that YouTube ad revenue by making videos longer
Puppy Though I doubt Ill upgrade from my iPhone 13 pro Ill probably wait another year or two
easy test for crash detection is to put it in a RC car or a kids small electric driving car and let it hit on to a wall or something lets see how it does
Only apple could convince their minions that having a notch in 2022 is a feature
The price hikes in Europe are insane and they make the Iphone 14  14 pro extremely bad purchases especially the simple 14 model  most people are better off sticking with their iphone 13 or upgrading to 13 if they are iphone fans
Next year apple is gonna sell the people just a software update just wait and see
In europe the prices are 200 higher compared too America So far the same price announcement of Tim lol
I sure hope there are GOOD phone devices coming out in the next few months So over the Apple trickle technology Game over
Cool review
Is it possible to change the iphone 13 or 14 screen in to 14 pro screen
That born sinner amazing
Haha people are going small punch hole to UD display dude  apple include a Phill and they justify it by dynamic island thats all
the dynamic island is the statement that you were looking for apple is not giving up the notch any time soon
Is the name Dynamic Island that bad I happen to like the name lol
"Its so hard to decide to upgrade from the X The full screen form factor with great internals futureproofed it too much With a battery change every 4 years it probably could keep going for a decade 

Its still smooth after many updates does the stuff I need and still fits well in the Apple ecosystem 

Ill go check out the screen and camera quality in the Apple Store to decide but probably will keep the X until they get rid of the notch and go USBC"
"Has Apple done anything at all to make this phone more user repairable

Edit Oh you did answer my question towards the end of the video thanks"
So let me just clarify something they made the notch smaller so they can make it bigger with software DDD
truly LG was ahead of its time
As someone who is currently iphone 11 and those who have the same or lower this is a great upgrade for those lagging behind the tech curve Besides thats its one of those buy it cause i want it not because its substantially better The dynamic island is a game changer for api cutting out having to swipe to tapping and choosing what you want on screen at anytime
Something that comes to my mind is how much Dynamic Island will cause the selfie cmera to get dirty or FaceId errors because of the grease dirt or fingerprints over the lens let alone micro scratches and other damages from users scrubbing finger just in that spot
Great review Ive been watching your channel for years now and the videos get better and better
Please make a camera comparison with Xiaomi 12S Ultra
iPhone is so expensive in India  I rather prefer to pay down payment for a Car instead Shit a phone that loose it value in just 3 years As iphone starts in USA from 999 In India It starts from 1650 lol are average Indians richer then USA  Who the hell will buy this
Always on display wasnt needed imo
Its okay Andrew just keep the clamps as it is there
Can disable Dynamic Island
Did you know its called an Island because Apple filed the trademark in Jamaica It makes me love it even more now 
People used to buy iPhone and would want to use them worldwide now thats really hard eSim
MKBHD wont talk about basic features which we need on daily basis like no finger print sensor in the era of mask where facial recognition option is useless No super fast charging it takes 2 hours to charge with that useless charger  That ugly pill notch He always promotes  licks a of USA brands
I wont change my iPhone 11 Pro until they move to USBC Lot of neat features and stuff but practically all my devices except my iPhone are USBC and with the EU regulating Apple to use USBC I think they will move to USBC in the next release I can wait until then Pretty disappointing they just didnt switch it already
Wait At 1709 Apple clearly said that the iPhone 14 pro 48MP camera can record in 8K 24fps now I would think you know
wasnt it so hard to add the battery percentage
400 I gotcha I can read Apples mind Sim dongle You travel internationally and need a foreign SIM card to use a different network buy the adapter 
Really disappointed they removed live wallpapers with iOS 16 I want to downgrade back to iOS 157
Manh LG
Intro song link Bonnie Raitt bite
Apple should put the magsafe charging onto the iPhone like whats on the MacBooks or thunderbolt 4 with usbc That would definitely be better than lightning
So dynamic island is only on the pro
"Apple doesnt really invent anything new they are just using some old features and revamping it and presenting it as if it is new or it is their own In Android it is different whenever a new OS upgrades comes It seems different always It is just a matter of time till companies like asus xiaomi etc will push that front camera inside the display  they already did it earlier but need to rework in design and tech ofcourse  But Once thats shipped and adopted by android industry apple will then use it and overhype it to sell their devices 

Next 10 years we may see a huge growth in tech industry it will be interesting to see where apple will head or it will just sink with time the most interesting thing is companies like google are out of risk because google has lot of software products  so they are like deeply rooted into lot of things in tech Apple has closed ecosystem and services and It only plays within that ground "
Always with the amazing intros Amazing job marques
1106 and 1114
"I can watch the intro on repeat
Please make a studio video on that"
Apple is pro in developing a perfect feature It nails it when it does
HIW DID YOU GET IT TO SAY YOUR BATTERY PERCENTAGE IN THE BATTERY BAR
I love that youve added Dynamic Island to your globe 
So no one is going to talk about the finger print left on the front facing camera after interacting with dynamic island 
I thought low light performance was based on individual pixel size not amount of pixels Ie if you have a 1inch sensor with 12mp vs 48mp the 12 would be better in low light
A lot of national parks have zero cell services and seeing no EMS while driving down a dirt road 4 hours from home is quite terrifying super excited for the satellite feature gives some peace of mind
Satelit connection you have to have battery
Cant wait for this years blind camera test 
Shout out for using HOCUS POCUS music
Android already copied the dynamic island 
Everyone is a Pro nowadays Garbage update
Im patiently waiting for the iphone to use 1 inch sensor for its main camera before making the jump
am i the only one who find it ugly  u have to use 2 hands to use it and it take too much space
I love how MKBHD asks himself his own questions and answers LOL 
This feature will never hit a samsung 
That always on display is too bright Its kind of defeating the purpose of pressing the power button
"Iphones are the phone equivalent to Facebook or Instagram
Slowly dying minimal inovation to keep it going  continues to drastically lower expectations for anything better to come from the company year after year

Of course their loyal followers will purchase one any ways even through the phone is essentially a total flop"
"Way to put lipstick on a pig and make people think you innovated a genius feature 

While Apple stubbornly sticks with terrible face id they have to go to great lengths to overcome the massive shortcoming that is that gigantic hole they need to house a bunch of sensors 

Just put a fingerprint scanner back on your phones and quit already Anyone remember FORCE TOUCH er 3D touch Apple tries dumb stuff sometimes too but they hold on for too long in order to save face because of their massive ego 

So now you have a new software feature super useful not gimmicky at all to draw even more attention to the  thats supposedly a super useful not gimmicky feature too  

I actually wanted to switch to iphone this year because the pixel 6 is so horrible but it looks like Ill be going with Samsung because they actually care about visual design I know they used to love throwing in software gimmicks too but at least you could turn them off"
Honestly speaking dynamic Island is nothing new and exciting
nice intro idea didnt really look 4k idk if its the bitrate but good idea
"Theyll bring back the max or introduce the ultra which will have usb c and 8k video with up to 15TB 
This is my prediction but it wont be til at least iPhone 16 although the EU are getting pissed about lightening so maybe USB c next year"
Really love the dynamic island Because its like a very well designed task bar
Me happily enjoying my weekend riding a roller coaster  my iphone 14 pro be like ohh so ur in a car crash let me call sos 
 626 did anyone else go sure sure sure after he said the apple way 
Bring Mate 50 Pro this year pleaaase that could be a big rival for the 14pro
If Apple had a foldable Id buy it so fast
Dynamic island is stunning feature but always on is not that much needed I turn off on the second day of my galaxy phone But it very useful for watch
"If the pixel series can do it well then apple can

My pixel 4 xl detected me getting rearended at a stop light"
the incoming messages appearing under the dynamic island now looks awkward af
eSim only is not consumer friendly At all
Hard pass on dynamic island
That dynamic island thing is HUGE compared to other pill shaped holes Would you rather have a display with a huge hole in the screen with widgetsicons or have a tiny camera cut out tucked in the top
No USB C simply stubborn
How does the dynamic island behaves in landscape
Pixels have had crash detection for a few years Not something we want to test but just cool to call out
Is that an Tesla surfboard in the background
I cant afford these but watchfull video
Suprise he didnt talk about the battery life at all
I rather no the island is horrible because it basically removes 1 handed use no thank you and it can stay away from any phone I use
Am I the only one who noticed Marques say connecting to airpod twice while explaining the features of dynamic island
Dynamic BLURRY Selfie From you touching the selfie camera all day Lol
great video still waiting the full review of Samsung accesories Watch and buds
Hands down the best phone reviewer in YouTube Detailed and unbiased reviews on all products unlike those who are clearly biased on Apple products and cant find a single fault on their reviews Love love your channel
019 I knew you were going to use the pill for the name This and pixel 7 series are my most anticipated phones of the year I like what Apple did with the pill and the UI
I love the start of the video
Can you share please your wallpapers Great video btw Ill stick to my iPhone 13 Pro Max since there is not much of an upgrade
Upgrading from the 8 Plus to the 14 Pro and Im very excited for it I probably waited longer than most I wouldve upgraded to the 13 Pro but got lazy but the difference is big for someone like me Ive never had a phone with Face ID Im even amazed by that lol
Apple turned something that no one liked into something that everyone is praising marketing is everything
Good video man  loved the transitions of the chapters
Did someone forget to roto out the tripod in the final shot of the intro 
Awesome
My Apple Watch kept thinking I fell when trying to start a chainsaw
What about bike accidents Will it send location or not
That intro was insane 
Nostalgic feeling to hear those 20syl and Hocus Pocus songs 
dang what a turn around alpha was yesterdays wordle
My heart dropped when he dropped the phone LOL
Did he just agreed that he violated the NDA 
all these name drops and subtle pyschological queues to remind you of other brands the subtle zoom in camera movements when mentioning lists of things and the background items to symbolise other cultural tropes to influence viewer it is video on the iphone 14 pro but at the same time a video about you and how you are influenced by everything else in the video which does feel a bit cheap and derogatory why not be ernest and talk about the item you are reviewing rather than playing mind tricks with your audience is it to see a cultural zeitgeist how much you can influence a change in consumer spending habits
Iam gonna wait for pixel7
Apple be like  where the NDA he signed wheres it
Why do you say Dynamic Island is a terrible name  You wanted them to call it the cutout or the punch hole  Get over yourself man
Videos continue to be even better  Esim is actually great for international travel when you cant find a store to buy a SIM card Works well in Europe these days
LG has made significant contributions to the things weve normalized today like a dedicated wideangle camera double tap to wake or sleep and now the shortcuts bar Kinda miss having LG as a flagship competitor
That intro is wow
Good luck on your physical therapy
Thats a nice dog
"This might be a good value in the US but the prices in the Europe or in Poland at least are insane
Last year 999  5200zl
This year 999  6500zl"
"The satellite emergency SOS feature is NOT A RARE SCENARIO Plenty of the US even large cities have areas of absolutely no reception due to high amount of connected devices dense foliage between towers in rural areas the list goes on and on I think its one of the most undervalued new features and well likely see other manufacs scramble to copy something like this 

The fact that Apple had to create relay centers for this should tell you that this is a necessary feature not just a gimmick 911 call centers in the US are not required to accept texts and the SOS relay centers are there for this exact reason Im upgrading for this feature alone our power goes out and we lose cell signal we live in a rural area very often If I cant even call 911 in these times wed be SOL"
Shoutout to my LG V10
Waiting for lg to sue apple
I dont understand even Marques also being fooled by Apple new iPhone  Always on display only I use this in Android features are about 4 years ago 
What still pisses me off is that Apple hasnt updated the SLOMO since iPhone Xs Max  Yup still 240fps 1080p So disappointed
That space black looks amazing I havent been exited for lack of a better word in a new iPhone pro models in a very long time This year they really surprised everyone with the pros Cant wait to get mine
Since when Jidion does reviews
Isnt the 48 pixel sensor just a pixel divided into 4 on one pixel So isnt still a 12mp and not a true 48mp lens
IPhone 15 Always on display customization
does the 14 pro have 120hz refresh rate
I want this gorgeous looking wallpaper plz link
Did you guys forget to edit out the stand in the intro or was it meant to be seen
I keep hearing people say that the satellite messaging is a niche feature Im a backpacker and often find myself in the backwoods without any cell connection This sounds like an amazing feature something that would actually finally get me to switch from Galaxy
That hideous notch is gone at last Well done Apple
"Why it will be copied So I can use my phone with 2 hands 
Apple wanted to cover the new ugly floating notch with something that looks nice It is clever thats right But it is useless Good luck with keeping the selfie camera and sensors clean Not to forget the ergonomically it is stupid keep stretching your thumb to the top of the screen or else use both hands which defies the purpose of the well designed GUI 
Bro you are turning into a typical apple fan boy"
what if you got your phone on a roller coaster will that be a way to test car detection 
umm EDITING video are all good BUT dont you think apple SENT YOU the phone you were a lil bit of bias whereas before you did critize apple product too
Whats the title of the song you used for this video bro  I remember hearing this song from the af1 history
What about if you drop your phone will it trigger crash detection 
That intro is mad 
Can I ask where do you get your wallpapers
Uber knew I was in a crash using my phone so I guess thats already been done by Samsung cuz thats what I had on me and what the Uber driver was using and that was like 6 months ago
Always keeping it real thats why I subscribe to MKBHD
116 its not selling out if its your brand  Barby of Geography Now
iPhone review from a Apple Shill
You guys will realize all this will be a gimmick unfortunately I was expecting something better than this
Apple is very smart with their product I havent seen a single person who said how not removing the notch is basically stalling  for other iphones thatll  remove the notch  in the future Imagine if they removed the notch  then apple wouldve missed out on 2 possible I phones 
Was that a Tesla surfboard in the background
"Only Apple has been able to continue with a design for 4 years as a new very big innovation 
If any such company did in the Android market everyone would praise that company Since Johnny Ive left Apple there is no new design in any Apple product "
Shoutout to the guy that predicted the intro in the wvfrm comments 
LG V10 was one of my favorite phones
Love you bro
I almost cry when just saw the 30s intro Stunning
Thats cool and all butCAN WE SEE BATTERY  ON THE ICON YETTTTT
Dude the opening transitions GTFO
It wont be copied I think your delusional its just like the touch bar on the MacBook Pro a failed excuse for apply to justify the price  it will be dumped next year in favour of no notch  as Apple copies other smart phone manufactures
1754 the 48mp shot looks way way way better than the 12
Can I bring up how tight the videos graphics are clean
"I think DI has kinda revolutionized the iOS experience enough that at the very least fanboys and girls  will flock to this new experience on the Pro 

Cheers Love your channel"
not moving to that stupid ios cant even get the copy paste of text right and fast
The removal of the sim tray is the second step in going portless since the headphone jack I dont think they will ever have USBC they are gonna just remove the last port
Wonder if they will ever try to work in the Mac M cpus into iPhone
"I dont know why dynamic island reminds me of Galaxy s8s fingerprint scanner placement where every time you want to take photo it prompts you to clean the camera lens
Now were going to have smudgy selfies"
Isnt the dynamic island similar to the Touch Bar that was on past iterations of the MacBooks
"Nice  video MKBHD  
If u have done reviewing I want my phone back  "
People paying 1100 for a lgv10 Lol
The internal debate to wait until the new pixel 7 pro or ultra come out is hard
Hope your PT on your knee is going well
iPhone 14 x MKBHD
"So just to recap the iPhone 14 main features are just to catch up with other flag ships features 
The new notchnotification bar is something that can be added to almost every phone with a software update 

And still no type c cable 

The fact that people freak out when a new iPhone comes out still amazes me"
The dynamic island is a neat feature but good luck reaching it with your thumbs
I just feel like the dynamic island is going to result in a lot of people touching the selfie camera Maybe it wont be that big of a deal but then again maybe it will
Actually why do we need 8k video most phones have resolution below 4k right so does 8k make sense otherthan some high end tv
how did you manage to get month calendar on Lock Screen  iPhone 14 pro
Arent they forced to switch to usbc with the new European ruling
Im sticking to my 11 Pro till the 15 series comes out still very powerful and feels fresh after the iOS 16 update Gonna wait for USBC to finally come to iPhone
Accidental triggers could be track driving or acrobatics in a stunt planefighter jet as both will pull more gs then a normal car crash
Wownow we have a low notch
Simple solution to the cheesy Dynamic Island name Refer to it as the DI
You can easily test the satelite SOS communication in Germany where cellular coverage isnt great if you are not in a city
Apple keep playing yall 
Beautifully crafted vid Like damn All the questions I prossibily could think of ANSWERED ty
Dangg people sold their organs for this  get ur life together Coming from the person who hasnt changed her phone for since 2015 lol Ive been using the same gifted iphone 6s I still dont wanna change it but since the quick changing world is evolving daily apple decided not to give us software updates anymore that means soon most apps wont work on my phone and these phone wont be able to support 5G as well I knew It is out of my control but since im a frugal biatch Ill crawl my way up slow and steady Ill probably get used iphone 8 and wait until it fades thats how I crawled through since iphone 3gs iphone 4s iphone 5s then iphone 6s  why iphone Thats what my brain is used to im not a phone person  Id rather invest on my gaming laptop coz I can also use it for work I had only spent 90 for each phone everytime  and use the same number throughout I still have all iphones with me all working i sim unlocked all those by myself reset the factory and all updated to the max Im always shook how quick people change their phones  I guess this is because I grew up poor I have this mentality of not changing it if it is not broken yet Ill get iphone14 in 23years 
You forgot about new flash Marques 
I cant wait to get my phone Friday Im loving the DI lookIts the reason I brought the PM this time
Dynamic Island is a good name for bald patch that starts at the back of the head and grows over time
They should implement it in all iphones notch or not but yeahhhhhh
You probably can just throw the phone against a wall to test the crash sensor
Hey make sure to floss
"Dynamic island wont be copied  Its glorified pop up notification that all androids have in their notifications or in bubbles Have you noticed that apple cant fit more than 2 notifications in their notification bar
You still have to stretch up there to interact whats the difference between a tap and swipe to get to those controls Nah this will go the same way as Force touch 
I will hand it to Apple though those animations are gorgeous But functionally not quite there"
no it wont be
I dont know whats the world is saying
Why dont you test them
I miss 3d touch
Not at all impressed with their island
Man youve come SO far Insane how things go
DONT GET IOS 16 YET IF U HAVE A X XS OR 11 IT BREAKS UR PHONE
The dynamic island is kind of clever however you will have a dirty front selfie camera all the time from touching that area of the screen
What happened to those YouTubers with ticks that used to camp in every MKBHD videos
What widget is that with the dots
THANK YOU FOR FINALLY MENTIONING LG INVENTING THE DYNAMIC ISLAND 7 YEARS AGO 
"Alternate title 
This has been COPIED"
Tesla surfboard is the ultimate flex
The 128gb model costs 14k euros No matter how good it is it now costs almost as much as the base MBP Thats just crazy no matter how good it is
what is the dot widget thing you have on your homescreenlock screen
14 pro racism 
My broke ass watching this video just to know what the phone I cant buy can do
These NDAs and expression embargoes NEED TO BE BANNED
I dont like the fact that theres not a Sim card tray anymore because what if you pay off the phone with your carrier doing that 36 months plan and then say your little brother wants to have the phone Because originally you just had to swap out Sim cards and hop into your account with your existing carrier and bada boom Bada bean someone else has the phone Hopefully there will still be a way to do it just without the SIM card tray being there hopefully
Can I turn AlwaysOn Display off
Hate to disagree marques BUT This WontShouldnt Be Copied Having a broad notch is outdated inconvenient and non useful Apples customization does make it bearable but other companies have moved to a minimum hole punch design sooner willing to replace it with an  under display camera Its a shame that apple despite being so cash rich is spending literally nothing on innovation RD and leaving others to do the hard work Showcases their laid back approach with min upgrades in launches every year same processors different colors and still charging premium Hardly exciting anymore
As always superb video how does the camera compare to the Mi 12 Ultra
4rd time apple doesnt copy someone on the iPhone designs
You just killed it again with the cinematography of this video Good that you keep the ultra good shots separated from the bits of video where you talk
"Ya right people talking in the comments about copying notches 

I mean wow an always on display thats something Innovative"
Whats the size of your hoodie cuz I think that could fit me
Such a minor feature but its a good one
Apple is the best
I heard someone laughing in the background at 849
I was planning to upgrade to this from my iPhone 12 Pro but I will probably upgrade to a Samsung Galaxy Ultra instead
This is the most detailed review Ive seen from MKBHD
738 Seeing that cool always on display customization on  oneplus those were good old days with my one plus 6t 
Where can we get that wallpaper
The king of intros Great review
Apple used to be the leader of innovation 5 years later you can get a 300 dollar phone with no notch Now they have foldable glass phones Why the fuck is apple ballsy enough to pull this shit This is insulting on so many levels
Boring phones as expected
HeyBroLove From IndiaKeralaThis was a very detailed video
anyone elses preorder still say preparing for shipment
Dont forget to floss MKBHD
All that juice to run my various To Do list apps
Waiting for Dynamic SHORE on base iphone 15 next year including island features to a notch
Aint nobody copying this lil bro
Who here went to watch the lg phone video midway then came back to finish this
I smoked weed and saw this video and tripped over the whole video thinking that the globe behind Marques is the end of video annotation
Seems just like the touch bar
I work at a mobile retailer and well they run a promotion where if i trade my 12 pro max I get 1000 off the 14 pro max so thats the only reason Ill upgrade
Thats a genius way to sell old phone like something new 
yeeh i had lg v10
Coming from an hardcore android s22 ultra user  good for Apple great  Integration notification problem solved
Those intro graphics 
Feel like they couldve added a dynamic notch update to iOS 16 Wouldve been cool
why is a gap between sensor n cemera lens why dont just give a smaller pill shape its just weird dicision 
Yeah really nice
Semoga saya bisa membeli iPhone 14 Pro tahun depan Amen U can translate it 
u mean nobody in your town noticed you had no s i m s l o t
"Great review as always Thanks for posting The Dynamic Island moniker needs improvement for sure My suggestions perhaps equally awful are

Power Port
iWindow
Apple App Pill cringe"
I still feel like an all screen display with zero cutout would have been way better Fingerprint sensor on the screen or power button and all
People in cities and urban areas forget the USA has vast areas of forest and wilderness that many like to adventure in  These areas rarely have cell signals  This satellite feature is huge and may be used in all types of situations where I live and play Add Ill add this goes for the whole world not just America
The LG V10 comment was CLASSIC He called out  for doing something yet again Android had years before
iPhone degrade
"no one 
absolutely no one 
Apple Dynamic Island"
Watching this on my iPhone 6thinking it might be time
I heard the birds on the dynamic island animation  Awesome
You have to use an android for a week to really appreciate how great an iPhone is
"Its a great phone no doubts all iPhones are but im disappointed at the lack of something innovative Yeah the satellite thing is nice but youll probably never use it hope not colors are normal charging is the same still usb 20 speeds which is embarrassing for Apple battery is the same capacity or very close cameras are an improvement yeah but no excitement also like cinematic mode last year screen is good but it was already good That leaves the crazy pill or dynamic island which i dont like Because in practice robs more screen real estate than the notch because it sits lower into the screen and youll notice it when watching a video in full screen and no one talks about that lol
I guess ill try the new Pixel 7 Pro coming this October think the photography is gonna be awesome google is doing an amazing job in that area with their algorithms and the AI The Pixels are becoming a reference and possibly an icon in the near future Furthermore im invested in Android ecosystem so"
You really did drop the phone didnt you
1326 the LG V10 had a separate display up top How is that the same thing as the dynamic island
Do a review of a new Huawei mate 50 pro
Does anybody know what size iphone 14 PRO he is using
Gonna wait for iphone 15 pro max to jump from my 11
215  is that some sneaky ad
The dynamic island its another gimmick from Apple Yeah its a bit cool but nothing revolutionary as many things that Apple did
I hope they keep the sim as well because today I use my iPhone 13 Pro as dual sim for having my private phone and work phone by combining the esim and normal sim
Im still on my 11pro maxI may as well go ahead and upgrade Im tempted to check out Samsungs new fold until iPhone 15 releasesIm still thinking about it
Saying that the iPhone is just a thousand dollars is pretty easy for anyone from the US but for the people in India this same device costs 129990 or 1600 It just aint worth it for half the price we can get the Galaxy S22 which will work just fine
220 My Samsung S21 already has that feature Was in a car crash 2 months ago and my phone called 911 for me by the time i picked in up from the floor an operator was already on the line
Aye props to marcus for playing Born Sinner J cole be the GOAT 
There is more to the NoSim US Only Model iPhone 14 I believe Apple has made a conscious business decision to stick with the lightning port for the US and nonEU countries after the European Unions new USBC port law takes effect This way it will be difficult for people to import US iPhone models into Europe after the new law takes effect Thats a boneheaded move because business travelers will now either have to carry two phones or switch to android really stupid and unnecessary mercantilism I hope I am wrong
"The aod part of the video helped me clear something up

I watched a video that explained apple didnt have an aod yet because they were concerned about battery life so waited until they could get a 1hz display 

I would have preferred if they had it be all black maybe album art or something but not like this It would clearly affect battery life more and provide little advantage to just having it be black"
MKBHD is an honest guy 
no sim card and more ways to track your lifesign me up
Howd you get that wallpaper Id love to have it 
Best review
Marques with the Apple boner again
This guys video editing is not of this universe
bro i still have an I phone 8 se imma upgrade
Why didnt they make the Dynamic Island at least  have the ability to be moved around the phonelike on the sides or anywhere the person wants thats convenient to each individualits a cheesy little gimmicky that Apple has done to obviously cover up the notch thats still thereApple should have concentrated more on trying to get rid of the notchinstead of putting this gimmick around it lol
Waiting for crash detection test
Great vid bro I appreciate the honesty Time to get that hoodie in 4xl lol
worst iphone screen look ever I wont pay 14001600 for a phone with a mouth like its out of plastic surgery
Cool hood
Jesus died for our sins so that we can go to heaven He payed our price Put your trust in Jesus Christ and he will grant you the gift of heaven
This Dynamic island will stay for another 5 years
Im upgrading to the 14 from a regular iPhone 10 you can imagine my excitement lol
The LG V series thing isnt the same
I want to compliment apple iOS 16 The battery life  standby time definitely improved and much better than iOS 156 on my iPhone 12 PM
always on display KEKW
For me i will pick andriod phone any day coz they have the biggest batteries fast charging biggest cameras   wireless charging   and much faster   a lot of innovation  every year    what else i need  i get it Android is not as good as  apple os
If I have an iPhone XR with 128GB almost used should I upgrade to 14 pro max 
The always ondisplay feature is the most dumb feature Ive ever seen developed by apple I think they should call it alwaysondisplay instead lol
I have an iPhone SE 2020 so its about 25 years old Battery life is 80 so it doesnt last that long and the internal memory is almost full Ive been thinking about getting the 14 pro Anyone have any thoughts about this
Apple is great for introducing smart phone ideas that other android manufacturers than copy and keep refining for years to come 
forget the iphone whoever see marquese brownlee using anything is better
I play a game and name the fonts they use for intros this was dunkin week
Wait that intro animation was genius dude
Maneh gokil pisan
Didnt expect the v10 comment 
Lg rocks
Can you turn off the island
"Nobody

MQBHD LOOK AT THIS GRAPH"
Still refusing to buy an iPhone with lightning port Otherwise its made me excited for the 15 Pro which I definitely buy
Good job flossing 
almost all the new features were already in android the only thing different is the dynamic island
I like the idea of Dynamic Island but I would love it to be combined in the future with the underdisplay camera
Basically its an iphone 13 pro thats called iphone 14 pro with an island
"The best at given us accurate information about the iPhone
  Island "
"What happened on minute 1031 iPhone went from a network state to sos state  

As always great video Marques

Cheers "
That dynamic island is a gimmick
So apple spying 247 for car crashes What an excuse to spy Is the spying why they need a faster processor Scam
1851 min Cinematic mode was always 30 fps even on iPhone 13 Pros Its 24 fps that was added this year 
Does anyone know how i can get the international version iphone 14 pro max that takes a sim card this e sim wont cut it for me 
Can we disable the dynamic island in setting Thanks
"Interesting question regarding how the iPhone will recognize a car accident My Garmin smartwatch has also a functionality to detect whether youve had an accident like for example while riding your bike and I had to disable this because everytime that I had to brake in a corner due to a traffic light it detected it as a crash due to the sudden velocity change

Im sure there will be videos of people simulating a car crash with speakers recreating the sounds flipping the iPhone in the air and such things D"
Can you please do a review for MOTO Edge 30 ULTRA It might be a good flagship killer in terms of price vs features I value your reviews the most and your insights were really helpful too for me and because of your reviews only I bought my previous phone OnePlus 6  It was worth it
Video length was not worth it
Miss that intro song 
Im good with my android phone with punch hole only Good for them they like but android freedom Anything is customizable
Sony is far ahead than Apple but how did apple managed to fool people decades on Really i dont know
I would really like the option just to have the black screen for always on display instead of the wallpaper
I think next level they should add customizations to the island like for example changing the color from black to red
With the dynamic island does it open up all the time Like when youre watching YouTube or playing a game Just open up to show you notifications
Awesome video
1114 little flex here
I miss LGs V series 
I dont want any holes at all  God almighty
That island is just animated smoke and mirrors hiding their hardware failure of notch Cant fool me
Marques  Did You Floss today 
Space Black or Deep Purple
That intro animation though
As in they copied from Samsung
Umm in 18 months there will be one or two more generations of under screen selfie cameras and most android flagships will not have any hole punch or notch at all and will still have a good selfie camera
usually apple does a lot of things better even if they do it late but this is the one time where they clearly did always on display worse thats way too bright for always on thats literally on not even asleep also the esim is a huge deal breaker one of the biggest drawbacks of this lineup i wanted to upgrade my iphone 12 and now im not sure if i want to even though i like the pill style notch better than the notch on iphone 12
When will the new update come out
Im almost 100 sure samsung will not be doing that i thing the s23 will have the camera hidden under the display Team samsung on a different level
It looks like an android 
"No USBC really killed the 14 Pro for me
I use my 13 Pro to shoot videos with friends and transfering files is a pain in the a especially from iOS to Windows
I was hoping this year might bring USBC to the iPhone but it looks like thatll come next year

Overall these phones look cool and I cant wait to see how Apple improves upon them next year"
Idk I just lost interest in the phone after this video and I was actually excited about it
wat wallpaper is this
Cole world
712 i am usually not the one who say ooo android got it first they copied it but sorry that animation is 11 stolen from stock android and you even give them credit for that and act as if apple invented it sorry man but i thought you had been using a pixel i mean you made like 500 videos ranting about how bad they are so you should know
i missed that AllttA intro song i havent heard it in so long 
This review feels so comfortable 
As far as ESIM They wont be able to expand this to Europe since the EU would probably see it as consumer hostile etc I think it is Needs better regulation especially in the US in order for it to be a smart thing
Hows YouTuber in the USA E Sim going to effect you guys
Apple will innovate yall to death with stuff you wont even use 
Next year when they finally switch to usb c and my galaxy s21 start dying then maybe Ill consider iphone 15
So how many max bg apps can the island handle If anyone knows
Please share wallpaper link
What about Low light mode  They claimed 2x better than previous year 
The old intro song of mkbhd 
Please verify the statement of iphone 13 pro cases fit 14 Pro the button layout and camera cutout are different 
I lost it at the seagull sound effect Its such a terrible name
Like for the LG mention
When is the iPhone 20 coming out
Is the calendar widget on the lock screen looking like that 14 exclusive I dont see that on my 13pro
Lg was soo good I wish they still made phones
I wish we had hoodie season here in Florida but its just way too hot Even in the winter months
I really want to know the battery life of this phone especially without the always on display but I think its gonna be later on
Iphone 14 and 14 plus Iphone 14pro and 14 pro max actually amazing and a bit innovative in a way
Im upgrading to 14 pro max from 12 pro max Wondering how the Dynamic Island will be with the larger screen and the reachability for it
"Still not better than Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G IPhone is simple  basic for those who want something easy Samsung is for those who want the best in every category from customizability new word to average everyday necessities 

Not to mention Apple is only copying  pasting Samsungs exceptional features like having a bigger phone which Samsung did 1st in 2011 till now Always on Display in 2022 "
Good video but title Not really
Wont the AOD leave screen burning through time 
you are so much talking 
what do you mean by overexpose
Always love the intros this channel 
Me watching this on my iPhone 8 because its still a totally fine and usable phone
One issue I think will be Is that smudges on front camera more often 
My God Man  How can Apple continuously print money without doing anything remotely innovative in a decade
What if the phone detects youre in a car when someone drops the phone out of a helicopter for a drop test
The Dinamic island is already being copied by 3rd party app developers The whole industry just sits back and copies Apples every move thinking that its going to benefit them
Ffs apple just give us the normal alwayson display for ALL oled iphones no need to do these dimmed wallpaper stuff and making it exclusive to the totl pro models
The Dynamic Island looks beautiful
He doesnt talk about the battery life in the Pro Version 
Run the stairs Yup gotcha
The flip z 4 is the only real upgrade and change of lifestyle phone Everything else isnt worth the upgrade
That into is Sick
Why is dynamic island so cheesy to you Youve called all of their processors bionic for years At least this is what it says it is A dynalic island of notifications on the ocean of your display at all times
Does anyone see a big black hole in the picture Is quite noticeable and  very distracting
Wow Dynamic island so good Can it make itself completely dissapear and stop blocking the screen
Ill miss the Sierra Blue on pro models
Thank you so much for your honesty
Marques you are not alone  whenever I ride my motorcycle slow my Apple Watch is like you did this much of outdoor cycling  
For someone coming from Android Would it make more sense to get the 13Pro over the 14 non pro If they are at the same price point
Not if the market was any good  so yes
"This will be copied
Its not even been 3 days 
Xiaomi already copied it the day after the Apple live event "
I always watch your videos just for intros
"itoddles be like the notch is a feature tho 
"
Does the AOD have the option to only turn on on new notifications No Still worse than my 200 Samsung
Yeah the phone stuff is great but can we take a moment to appreciate the return of a classic MKBHD intro music  major nostalgia
Apple clowns will call dumb Island revolutionary How ridiculous
Others will TRY to copy it but will fail miserably Apple slam dunked on everyone and everything this year Nobody will come close
black and purple they going for that GameCube look
The no physical sim card slot is BS Im an American living in Italy and the American iPhone is so much cheaper than the European one to now Im screwed if I want to buy one
The iPhone cinematic mode always supported 30 FPS This was a problem considering films are shot at 24 FPS so not very cinematic The big update this year is that we can do 4K and 24fps vs 1080p at 30fps
Usin LG wing
Clap for apple theyve done nothing
"I watch lot of movies and you tube videos
But that big notch just hurt especially while watching full screen video
Its a pass until notch gets removed
I dont need dynamic island"
Ill be upgrading from the iPhone XS Max
Please give your views on bloody old stock with New name i phone 14 and 14 max
Most impressive thing is that you got alpha in three 1241 Daaang
Watching this on my iPhone 6
love the 69 battery Lol
This intro sequence is absolute gold
the intro is just WOW
Why will Android manufacturers copy the pill when most of them have a hole punch camera cut out and the notification tray does all that and more than what the pills does Youre reaching Hard Lol
I was doing something with my girlfriend and my iPhone was in my pocket and it thought I was driving  might call emergency services cos my heart was raising
What about Screen bleeding due to always on display Those led which are always lit can burn out or deteriorat over time leave marks on screen
Ever since I updated to iOS 16 I cant use CarPlay anymore
Thats one sick intro
Even though i will still prefer the punch whole over this but this is surely better than the old one and keeping the fact apple tries to keep its look as signature
oh that shot on 1250 of the finger smudge on the front facing camera not great for taking selfies anymore i guess
The Space black color is gorgeous
I sure hope not
"whats the widget with the dots called that you use and shows up on your lockscreen
btw YOUR CONTENT VIDEOS ISARE AWESOME"
iPhone is the biggest scam ever 
That Google Doc at 0202 is actually showing the script for the video Very meta 
Hows the battery life
Heres the question why does it only have 18 charge
I noticed for some things that dynamic island is pretty bad like airpods It doesnt really show  anything useful while a simple pop up would be way usefulim just thinking that ioss way of app switching and seeing whats going on is a very badly made on after using it for two years Animations are tooon the nose and too specific with location that also corresponds to how you use our fingers on the screen and after a while it just sucks and is sooooo unaccurate Its not fast cause apps will crash if you do anything too hastily Also it shows too little and switching isnt as dynamic as on android which recognises that you have that app and automatically opens them and so on That island is a full on gimmick and you fail to recognise it as such Nobody will copy it
samsung and google will probably copy them and then make fun of apple
"Please please someone tell me the name of the song at 527 

Whats goin on whats goin on its the return on and on "
Brilliant always having to tap right on the camera when using the dynamic island no iPhone selfie camera will ever be fingerprint free
MKBHD just proved apple sells the same device to everyone lol
Junk
How is the battery life Or did I miss it in the video
Honestly even if you want the phone just wait one more year to teach apple to listen to their users and put USB C in their phones
Excellent run down on the 14 Also love the music interludes you chose Keep up the fantastic work Love the dog too Woof
I can feel this vedio is not edited by mkbhd
I travel OCONUS too much the esim US only killed my interest Nor do I care about the always on display  magic pill Ill pick one up internationally should I decide to purchase
Isnt all that animatingelongating black pill block all the info at the top when its stretched out wide and its doing an on going task Call me weird but I want as much info at the top as possible at a quick glance Like for ex on my android now the time is displayed to the seconds not just minutes My immediate reactionquick solution was They shouldve made the whole pill transparent and give option for how opaque vs transpent
that intro was everything 
HOT TAKE since touching the dynamic island requires two hands to reach the top the screen its not actually convenient at all
Isnt it a problem that call notifications appear on the dynamic island notch How will you answer with one hand
The dynamic island is even more noticeable than the notch
They copy to samsung
What happens when you play a video full screen Can the full screen be resized to exclude the island
Heres a thought an esim on a Apple Watch is regionally locked to only certain providers I wonder if this is a thing with the new iPhone
Cant wait to get mine
Removing the sim wont work in Canada
The dynamic Island is a very smart futureproof idea Its basically the new notch and that means its here to stay for a few generations Considering the way they worked the OS around the pill and made the notification system interact with that area means that a lot of time was put into it and also the fact that they really made a big deal out of it its a thing that theyll stick with for a while
Hoodie season my ass not where I live lmao
Full screen
2 seconds into that intro and hearing Disarm INSTANT LIKE
1502 This looks funny for some reason lol
I appreciate Apple just didnt say there your notch is slightly smaller buy this phone They actually implemented some nice software to make it different However love my iPhone 13 Pro Max with its all day battery and wont be upgrading unless my carrier gives me a great deal on my tradein
does the camera come with the wheel i found the speaker its ontop of the phone
id STILL rather have a SAMSUNG BABY
Andews ads please keep the clamps hidden in the back Only legends will understand this
You couldve show the LGs mentioned a clip would be enough 
Dynamic island when playing video will  look like 
A very refined up date 
At 1 per hour its still 24 of wasted battery life when always display is on
the battery life on my wifes iPhone 12 sucks so we are upgrading
I have a pixel3 are the pictures really better than that on the iphone 14 pro
"I love how apple took something people found annoying and made it convenient 

Very smart I really want to get this 14 pro it looks incredible"
Dynamic intro 
so much product placement slow down man you are not yet listed on nasdaq
I really like the dynamic island Its a neat way to integrate the notch But the AOD isnt very useful Because if you arent using your phone chances are you arent looking at it so I dont see the use of it And if you have one of the Apple Watches with the AOD I really dont see the point But overall I wont be upgrading from my 13 Pro Ive upgraded all my Apple devices this year and I cant justify giving apple more of my money
Dynamic Island is me in the morning
I will buy an iPhone the moment they switch to USB C I would guess theyre going to make the change with the pro lineup first Im going to start saving now
Dynamic island Cant wait to keep touching my selfie camera until its too dirty to use as a camera
Order the 14 Pro Deep Purple lets see what I got myself into
They brought back the cool intros 
He said Cinematic mode now supports 30fps  Thats what it was before  It NOW supports 24fps
So theyre making them more like android now A result of losing their market share steadily in the last few years
The pros of the animation on dynamic punchole is ok but should talk about the cons of how terrible the cutout looks on videos and games
Love the video as usual however I HATE the transitions  DO NOT USE AGAIN
Do you think the iPhone will experience a burn in of the display with always on I know its common on android and with OLED displays but covered under warranty
Its all Bullshit
Battery level went from 96 to 69 in a few seconds at 1140 
Awesome video Mkbhd But Im pretty sure Im not gonna be the only one when I say this But where do you get your phone wallpapers Because they look really really cool and I can never seem to find them So if someone could please tell me where Mkbhd gets his wallpapers from thatd be greatly appreciated
Should have just called it the pill instead of dynamic island 
When will reviews for the new AirPod pros release
Wow truly wow I wish I can get a newer version of lg v10 right now The second screen is even better than the island
1114 12500
Only reason why Im upgrading is the 800 dollars offer for my 13 pro max trade in
conclusion save money and buy a 13pro
You have the best put together videos in the world I wanna be like you when I grow up You make nerds look cool Imma grab one of those hoodies too
My iPhone 11 is crapping out just when the new iPhone will be released  
Is it esim to pro models too 
iphone 8 or later
Punchole with Dynamic island saved for iphone 15 pro to small update for apple sheep and they will say its a big update 
Does anybody know the song when  internal shows up
I really hope other phones DONT copy this dumbass pill feature
Anyone knows what widgets he uses on his lockscreen The calendar dots etc
1242 first attempt on wordle AUDIO Relatable
I hope the glass on the back being separate means its a lot cheaper to replace
So the dynamic island is basically Androids floating apps done the Apple way except the HUGE pill  interrupts your media viewing experiencestill late to the partyhard to swallow pun intended
How does YouTube videos look without Zoomed to fill On the iPhone 13 Pro Max videos fits perfect without notch showing Guess the Dynamic Island will be visible now as it sits lower
Is it a coincidence that the iphone 14s wallpaper he had is the same as my wallpaper 
1323 You just couldnt help yourself right Marques LG isnt even in the phone game anymore Why do you constantly want or feel that Apple 1 phone maker has to innovate everything first compared to a thousand Android OEMs SMDH
I absolutely hate the dynamic island and think its a way too cheap gimmicky feature All it does is embrace a problem instead fixing in screen face camera problem Makes me skip this generation and stay with the 13 Apple is all about impressive techsoftware not trying to hide a notch and act like it was intentional Remove the notch entirely bring back a touch id button and put a small screen in the back for all picture Or even do a motorized camera come on now
I think Ill wait until the iPhone 15 or 16
Strange that Siri isnt a part of the dynamic island
Amazing intro and review Hoping some features trickle down next year to base models PS Please clean the video sensor my OCD cant unsee the sensor spots on the right side
I dont see the hate with the iPhone notch Apple is distancing themselves with those cheap looking android phones
"Why can we see the stick holding up the iphone in the intro  Was that intended


Edit watching the rest of the video  I guess it was intended"
the cut out looks like crap when is on landscapereally hard to ignore now
Having the battery percentage back is the best thing about IOS 16
Making the switch to the iPhone 14 Pro after my Pixel 3a is finally too buggy to use Excited to switch and see what Ive missed from Apple over the past 3 years Solid content as always MKBHD team
Nice Apple Watch tan line
Feels like lg was way ahead of its competition
Touch Bar 20
Not going to upgrade
Big downside is the ESIM only Not every country uses ESIM only A lot if not all countries especially in Asia mostly uses physical SIM So Apple might lose a ton of consumers here Bad move
Typical iPhone keeps looking the same every year The need to come up with folding phones  soon
No one will copy this shit
I think it will be better to give accidental crash detection than to not give at all during a crash so few accidental triggers are fine
Great phone would have ordered it but in Italy it starts at more than 1300 Thats more than what I paid for my MacBook
the dogs smiling thats all i needed to see to make my day
Nice into using the dynamic island
I really wanna see Macbooks adopt this cutout with Face ID implemented It would be super slick
Dynamic  island  is a nice way to put fingerprints  on your front camera 
I dont think the appleway for the always on display is a good way to go about things Interfaces should be designed differently depending on if youre actively looking at them or glancing at them laying on a desk somewhere and whether or not they take any input    What they have done is repurposed the lock screen dimmed a few zones and then called the fact they didnt do anything better revolutionary Modern OxygenOS for all its faults does a way better job at always on There are big icons for every app that has a notification on the alwayson these icons get shrunken down when switching to the lock screen to make space for the actual content of the notification The amount of stuff that is displayed is KEPT TO A MINIMUM since its constantly draining the battery Why on earth would apple think putting a fricking wallpaper that covers the entire screen on the alwayson is a good idea
Cameras are still 12 megapixels
That intro was insane
"Someone copies dynamic island 
Users THATS APPLES FEATURE BOOOOOOOOO

Apple takes out features from android from 10 years ago and puts it into iphones
Users OMG THIS IS BRILLIANT TIM COOK IS GENIUS"
I dont understand how my iphone is gonna survive the crash if I didnt make it
This is my favorite song on this channel 
Am i bothered by lipsync feels like video is ahead by a frame or two Anyone else is bothered by this
Tbh man just shit on apple the whole video 
THE only difference i see is the camera bump getting hillariously larger
love ur vids and takes on new tech bro
Shoutout to Kanye Wests Graduation completed 15 years
you know if they are so keen on having a notch its atleast nice they made it fit in with the phone
dope intro
Now waiting for the intro BTS on the The Studio Channel
Thank you for the V10 shoutout I loved that phone XD
138 I want that wallpaper 
Why not everything else is copied 
"ANOTHER prores iPhone with no capability to transfer large files in a reasonable time is SAD

A highenergy consumption implementation of AOD with bright and colored pixels is just silly Running fewer pixels at lower energies is how OLED saves enough energy to stay on Samsung knows it and they make the OLEDs

Catch up Apple"
smudge on the selfie camera on 1302
From an idealistic art peoples point of view that Dynamic Island is the absolute harmony between hardware and software that can be the only major point that drives them to upgrade
Can someone tell me what that widget is It looks clean
1805 that sounds weird out of context
Dynamic Island might be copied but it shouldnt be What Android smartphones doing is eliminating the notch why should they put something there Its hard to use with one hand If it only about some more obvious notifications than icons then some Android UIs have already tried something like it
You should probably be careful openly admitting to taking it outside against Apples wishes lol
Iphones always on display feature copied from Android apple is the main copier of android
Intros are on the next level now
They put the iphone in a car crash test
I wonder how the crash detection will work for those of us involved in Motorsport For example being at a drift event and crashing into a tyre wall
The always on display do you think it will burn the OLED display quickly
"I am actually most excited about the AOD because ever since I started wearing an Apple Watch I have been missing the auto screen wake for notifications

Almost always when working at my desk I prefer to glance over to my phone rather than raise my hand

Also sometimes I want to turn off annoying haptic feedback for my watch so then I have no audio nor video feedback for incoming notifications because my phone and watch are forever silenced"
Dont know why but this Dynamic Island looks like a failed effort to hide something
If you watch enough iPhone presentations than you know that the Pro iPhone really is and has been all about the Cameras They spent 23 minutes on stage talking about the iPhone 14 Pro and seven of those minutes about 33 just talking about Camera
whats your primary device
How do YouTube videos with this aspect ratio look with the pill Is it cutting in
Better support iphones man if iphone fails americas economy will definitely fail
Dynamic island reminds me of the second screen on my LG Q8 we can set shortcuts time media players and is even used as a zoom dial and shooting option in the camera app but this feature is not used by any other apps beside the OS I think that there is some inspiration taken from LG but no one ever thinks about it LG has lots of good idea and its just sad to see that brand died
Apple calls it Always on because it is Always ON 
The Porsche 911 of smartphones
Well if you buy iPhone 14 pro max good luck with interacting with your island in the top of the biggest screen
I like how they did that dynamic island Now its functional No more need to get rid of the notch I said the same thing regarding that the other smartphone manufacturers will most certainly copy this feature It solves a lot of problems
Worse battery performance due to brighter display peak maybe
Bro that notch is doing nothingits just a black cutout how can they call it a feature
"Nicr shout out to the lg v10 
RIP LG and u should have been loved much more "
"One thing Id like to say
Its a pleasure watching MKBHDs video 
Whereas
Its fun watching MrWhoseTheBosss video"
Yes the Dynamic Island is a good reason to upgrade for me
Ofc it will I bet Samsung will be the first
Google has had accident detection for a while now on Pixels
I just want the Apple Watch ultra I have the 13 pro max not much of a diff to upgrade honestly
Just bought the z fold 4 but this one kinda made me wanna go back to iphone Ill probably switch back with the 15
Didnt like the notch
No HDR support in Netflix in iPhone 14 series
I cant get over the intro
Why didnt samsung thought of the island with the puncholes  Im feeling left out tbh i own the s22 ultra 
"I love yr 
videos"
crack
I will glady pay  1000 dollars I dont even need rebacca my gilfriend will be impressed all my epic megapixels will show her and then she will get to my island and we will be contextswitching between foreground and background application all day long with my new sillicon adhesive
Bro last la load aachu bro
The watch tan line 
Guy nails the intro always
Holy shit he knows what an API is Tickle me impressed
Where is clear all open app button
"So you going to test the watch ultra in the sea
Will wait for that for sure "
"THE BEST IPHONE EVER

HANDS DOWNN"
Apple has smartly reduced the aperture size of all 3 back cameras as compared to IPhone 13prowhich means they will be able to launch iPhone 15pro with better aperture claims Consumers get fooled every time
CONnectivity
Does the island cut into and block YouTube viewing
The dynamic Island baby What are a terrible name  bro u r 
Always on display will burn in
1555 not the spotted lanternfly 
Transitions keep getting bette Marques keep it up 
It would so stupid of android to copy dynamic island Android already has all of that in notification panel and then notification panel has icons for new notifications too
I dont even know why I watch these videos I wont ever afford or want these iphones
Good Luck for using always on display in an iPhone
Live wallpapers have also gone
That intro is Apple commercial worthy
"Now we have to wipe all the ketchup and mayo getting smeared on the front cam before getting a shot right Honestly who came up with this ridiculous dynamic island idea though 
And literally the whole world runs on USBC now wake up Team Apple"
Ill be back in a few years when the 16 is out
If Im going 40 mph and I hit a big jump on a snowboard and its a bad fall is it going to think car accident We will find out this winter
Im actually kinda disappointed that Apple didnt add more cameras  I know in the past people poked fun at it for the longest time
Why is Marques Brownlee losing so much subscribers
The AOD is implemented in a very cool way unfortunately its a function I never use on Android At first it seemed interesting but when Im not using the phone it keeps distracting me when the time changes and I notice it from the corner of my eye So I have to put the phone face down which defeats the purpose of AOD The wake up function when you move the phone is way more useful to quickly peak at the time or notifications
You could test the emergency feature on one of them crash tests they do with cars
Marques do you think the same thing can be done even with a notch Like a dynamic notch
Imma say this Listening to On and On again on this channel just brings back weirdly Iphone 5s  Nexus 5 vibes
You can use DENT Wireless data packages for your esim Any data you dont use your can sell it back on the market or gift it to someone else
Hmm maybe it was the No Cell Coverage that was affecting your battery more than it was the always on display
Just call it Dyno Dynamic Notch
It says floss on my mans to do list
is it just me whos curious about the thing popping out from right at 1426 
Actually cinematic ONLY supported 1080p 30 before the new feature is actually 4k 24 
AlwaysOn isnt even new for apple watches have had it for a few years now
Yearly new devices might the dumbest thing ever for innovation same as how fifa and cod releases games every year 1 year is not enough time to make any significant innovations or improvements Its a waste of resources and is just pure greed tbh
I wanted to get it but being a military family moving overseas in the next year Im not sure Im totally on board with esim just yet
I do wish you went over how the selfies are after having used the dynamic island and if your front cam is smudged with your fingers
058  I like the way Mr MKBHD pushed the older version of iPhone
Didnt all the iPhones have autofocus on the front camera
It wont be copied Samsung got rid of it and made it tiny nearly 4 years ago
The whole time I was waiting for you to say that text messages and other notifications come out of the dynamic island and they dont Which kind of bums me out as I want it full advantage of it I hope a future 161 update allows that
ah that good old intro
That moment  dbrand subttle promotionWow 
The dynamic island is a dumb gimmick They basically said we cant get rid of the notch so lets do some dumb creative stuff with it But people go nuts over that kinda wack stuff
Ill just call it the island if I ever find myself referring to it
Great Video MKBHD 
I thought it was called dynamic eyelid 
The pro review nice
Did the ip14pMx get a speaker upgrade
Love Your Videos MKBHD  Great Video MKBHD 
FINALLY ive been holding off on buying the phone bc ive been waiting for this review
The dynamic island is cool but when you really think about it it is still a gigantic black bar in the screen They just moved it from the edge into the screen
Im just a dynamic island boi 
No thanks The hole punch is a compromise marketed as a feature by Apple I want a different solution for the front facing camera
Wallpaper is quiet impressive 
Can we put like an island with sand and some trees  around that In a wallpaper
The watch tan lines lol 
rock solid performance shows Broll of it stuttering and taking a long time to load 
FOR SURE ANDROID WILL COPY THIS 
You meant the dynamic island right 
I have zero interest in iPhones but that was another great review 
third party app should make a dynamic island like feature for samsung s10 that would be cute lol kiddin
Want this wallpaper 
136 Notifications dont have the solid gray background but the background is blurred anyone knows to enable this 
Man i havent listened to Kanye in years That album is so nostalgic
In China iPhone have 2 SIM cards  in US we got 0
Once again Apple fails to impress me
I upgraded from a 12 Pro  I generally try to upgrade before the  Buyback Value Drops the most Which for me is every other year
so there is no physical SIM card on iPhone 14 pro
Is that a battery percentage D
nice tan at 1453 D
Dynamic island is a normal software feature kind of task bar The major issue is it will results in smudges on front faceid censor and  selfie camera In practice it has more issues Samsung had  edge task bar on its earlier Galaxy phones It was not a success
But does the screen still get hot and dim when the brightness is all the way up in the sun
Cinematic mode on the iphone 13 pro was also 30 fps It was the only option
My boy just seems so sad while doing this review 
HOW WILL PEOPLE KNOW IM BETTER THEN THEM IF THE NEW PHONE LOOKS THE SAME  s
At work my watch kept thinking I had a hard fall when I would drop a heavy metal object on the ground It would drop and vibrate my arm and trigger the SOS warning
When s22 ultra came out with 1700 nits brightness every youtuber was quick to point out that brightness scale is not linear and it is not such a great upgrade and now when apple does it everyone is going gaga over it like it is the best screen I dont understand this biasness towards apple and iphone in particular
Biggest dislike of iOS 16 is the notification being at the bottom  have to swipe up now instead of just glancing at it  all of it shows  yes I did change the notification settings but it is still at the bottom
Not buying after seeing the review
They are going to switch to usb c because of the eu but not before like 2024
No one talks about how that hole blocks videos and full screen apps
I bumped my arm on the door frame while entering my vehicle and my watch asked me if I had fallen and offered to call 911  It does not take much to initialize the shock sensor
"Honestly Im glad they finally found a way to make the stupid cut out useful and yes what they did is a fantastic way to do it but they could still do the same effing thing with a fake bezel that stay black and dont cut into the app content in landscape
I use HideMyNotch on my S22 and it blackout the status bar which hide the hole punch camera and leave the icons and clock floating on top of the screen and add rounded corners to mimic the real curved screen It looks like a Palm Pr from 2009 which is perfect"
Wallpaper pls
U should start doing iPhone ads
"I didnt like the Dynamic island i honestly think its ugly Plus its on top of the display and out of reach not very covinient
I also think that in some years it will disappear like the touchbar of the macbook"
Yes Youll notice the 2000 nits of brightness outside for a split second before the phone overheats and iOS throttles the system turning the brightness straight back to dim dim
Wouldnt this cause burn in overtime
The only thing that was amazing and interesting in this review was the intro other than that iPhone 14 line up overall is meh
That Intro   
Whats the big deal in it bro The notch is still there Its just a notification bar Anything apple do is uselessly hyped Reviewers might be getting paid well Good for them anyway
That intro was straight 
I can assume this new feature will cause fingerprints covering the front camera and sensor after repeated taps on the dynamic island necessitating frequent cleaning 
When you watch mrbeast too much and think 1000 is a low prize
roller coasters have triggered the car crash detector on my watch it checks many of the boxes speed noise rapid deceleration etc
Anybodys got the link for wallpaper 
Sorry But bet lots of folks buying this because of the Island I did 
How much noticeable dynamic Island is while watching video 
Your review of tech by Apple that is painfully behind and being enthusiastic about it is mindblowingly numb
Again not a word on speaker sound quality 
1106 and 1114 he said connecting Airpods twice XD
I think that esim only would increasing data which iPhone 14 series sold in Canada
Cant have enough appreciation for the intro  From sound design to color choice for background to the wallpaper and the sick motion graphics the team nailed it As soon as I saw the paint brush effect i went uuuuufffff Marvelous MKBHD  team 
"941 

Talking about thumbnail"
Im not even excited to watch Apple phones anymore its all the same
"What will apple do with this gimmick once cameras are fully concealed behind screens without degradation in quality Seems like a short term investment to me 
To say this feature is useful is like saying phones without notches should also have a big black island in the screen lol Its just a great way to hide a big ass hole"
Whos going to test the car crash detection I want to know if its working
In EuropePoland decision is even simpler Its much more expensive than last year model Its funny how Apple treats different regions Its even more funny when you know that in Poland functions like Siri or Live Text and a lot more are not supported at all
This is what is known as flagship content 
Is not the first time I hear you say that there is no touch capacitive sensor where the camera is now the dynamic island because there is no pixel there Just to clarify the capacitive layer is on top of the display and is transparent
marques please give me an iphone i will be happy with 111213 anyone 
Hes always digging down the rotten  to find a good part is he an affiliate 
Another Nothing phone
Surprised he didnt mention battery life
I will still stick with my 4 years old iPhone XS   Just want type C if Im willing to upgrade
"As an android user I dont like the dynamic island 
1 Its a silly name
2 Why would I want my notifications to be persistent on top of my screen real estate
3 The black bar looks ugly its asking for smudges on the front cam and permanent screen burn in Imagine watching a movie with that uglyass bar

Why would I want to go backwards No thanks Ill wait and see what they do with the 15"
I think that Dynamic Island is a great name It sure beats the hell out of pill lol
Dont you smudge up the camera like crazy with the dynamic island 
wallpaper pleaseee
"115 hoodie season 






My fellow brother its averaging 95f with a dew point of 5070 It is not hoodie season It might be where you live but In the lower parts of the US its still humid as hek"
You should have said  this is a copy of its predecessor 
Why does it feels like youre extra soft in the presentation this time 
They say 48MP but its crammed down into a small sensor its definitely not a replacement for cameras
The dynamic island design will probably hit the regular iPhone 15 next year and i feel like the notch will be gone At least that seems to make sense
"Give one to a demo derby  banger racing driver you know someone who literally crashes cars for fun on weekends

Also as they usually have airbags removed so you could see if it still works without the barometric information useful to know if you unknowingly have an airbag fault"
what a intro made my day man thanks for that
Love it
The fact that u brought up the LGV10 Is why imo you are 1 lol Im thinking The iPhone 14pro Max may be my 1st IPhone because of the lil quality of life improvements  the camera upgrade
The only thing other companies should be copying from Apple is there marketing Because they got people buying expensive phones for yearss Its the phone on the market how can that be true when they just got battery percentage widgets and Always on display Like we in 2022 folks
Apple doesnt innovatedynamic island announced Apple still copies everyone else wah wah wah lol
I want an always on display to show as little as possible why the fuck do i need to see the wallpaper with it Its things liek these that make apple an absolute garbagge of a firm to me people take this as something ultra important and useful when its the other way around just because its apple Get a grip with reality people Its not hate its just stupid what the software implementation of certain aspects has become in their sense Im honestly thinking of leaving the apple store where i work cause fuck all of this brainwash
hai
Is that a Tesla branded surfboard
No sim No thanks Having residencies in Europe Central America  the US this is a deal breaker for me
Ill be upgrading to the 14 pro from an 11 pro in a few weeks Really is a shame theres no astrophotography mode but Im loving the dynamic island
How do we imagine screen protectors working with this Any impact
Superb
"My soul iPhone 14 pro max 
My heart Samsung  S22 ultra
My wallet Nokia 1110"
Brining back LG from the grave
Is Marques holding the Pro Max or the regular Pro Model in his hands
Waiting for 15 Pro uprade from 13 pro its a no sense
These intros are getting unnecessarily complex
Of course Apple uses UI to cover up hardware limits Quintessential Apple
Just one thing you couldve just removed the dust from the camera in the cinematic shot in the intro and other shots why didnt you remove it I Know you couldve
iPhone sucks low light shots
Bro dropped a review before the rest of the world can get it
LG proud of Apple in heaven
Do you think its worth an upgrade if one owns the iphone XR
Ok so how many of us did a search in YouTube for the LG V10 and then find a really young MKBHD
maybe i will buy iphone to use crash detection 
The island will go the same way as the touch bar Im not a fan
Ill wait for the iPhone 15
Dynamic island eventually it will be called the Status Bar
"Youre testing the Hasselblad x2d
Cant wait for that"
So if I want to take a picture at 48MP I have to take it in ProRaw
This is the least excited Ive ever been for a new iPhone is this what it feels like to be grown up
Respect for the honest review as always
apple makes people fool on 14 pro and 14 pro max by saying their notch to dynamic Irelandits all about software and some foolish YouTuber behaves like it is marvelous 
"Crash Detection  Dude this is for them to say You didnt take out the accidental drop insurance We can see by the crash detection data that you dropped the phone You need to pay 600 for the repair
Crash Detection  Insurance sales for iPhone repair cover"
The intro was sick 
"What is that puppy noise at 846 
Hearing it in my headphone and at full surround sound on it almost scared me"
Now Im waiting for Samsung S 23 ultra 
HonestlyIm upgrading to 14pro from my iPhone XR that I had from 2019 I think its worth it 
Did people really hate the notch that much I had an iPhone X and now 11 pro and the notch has never bothered me I barely even notice it I just never understood why people moaned about it so much
What about the speakers The little speaker at the top is so tiny how does it sound
I remember in 2019 when everyone was talking about how huge the 11 pros camera was Now it looks like a baby next to the 14 pro Now even the massive 13 pros camera looks small Sheesh
Too bad of a review since you really are harsh on other brands
Even tho apple are the one who did copied they copied from  huawei and samsung and centerlized a little bit
"I used to own the V10 and when I saw the dynamic island mentally I immediately thought of the V10 

Thank you for that inclusion I miss that phone"
I like the fact that everytime when you review a phone when you open spotify is always a J cole song playing Big J cole fan too
I wonder how much use or how practical would be to use the island when you have to go out of your way to interact with it when you are not in landscape mode
You need to get the Tesla widget on your home screen
Everyone absolutely hating on the name dynamic island whilst simultaneously knowing exactly what it is and what it does is just an example of freaking epic allstar level marketing  1000 they gave it a horrid name on purpose just to keep people talking about it  PS yay alwayson off toggle
Wtf you mean 24fps
So new iPhone camera can give your dog a personality 
The AOD should get better when it gets the dynamic cards at the next update iOS 161 hopefully That could mean scores navigation media controls etc adding value As for having it on if you do not need the distraction just face the front display down
I do miss the second screen from LG V20 That was easily one of the best implementation of widget on any phone It served as Always on Display and widget at the same time
Marques Heres my iPhone 14 Pro review shot on the iPhone 15 Pro Enjoy
the AOD is WHACKKKK
8K video is nothing more than a gimmick You dont need 8K The 8K video on the Samsung s22 ultra is literally less sharp than the 4k video on the iPhone Its not true 8k and you dont need true 8K You dont need 8k at all because you cant even see the pixels on 4k without putting your face on the screen So 8k is a completely pointless gimmick the video will be choppy and full of aliasing They just need to keep improving 4k video on cameras
After ordering iPhone 14 Pro Max and Apple Watch 8 my wallet was dynamically emptied
"esim is not a sim anymore which is no sim
google drive is not a drive it is a network

without agreement of the carrier you cant transfer your esim by yourself
without internet you cant access your file in google drive"
At this point why even continue to lie about not having early access to these devices You always have them we know you do So why lie
Highly upset with Youtubes compression because I KNOW that intro looks gorgeous uncompressed While it still look great I know it was probably 10x better in the timline
I was never annoyed with the notch but now theres weird things that happen with apps where they want to use the full screen but then stuff gets blocked by the notch Like the other day when I was watching my YouTube videos vertically it shoved the screen up into the notch so part of the picture was blocked by it I know theres not a lot they can do to avoid it but it would be cool if it wasnt there
Crash detection is kind of a feature you will never get to see if it is really triggered or not Hopefully your loved one will get a call from Siri saying you are KIA
Just realized that my phone has a static island nice
Should have killed that Lantern Fly  1600
I trust in Steve Jobs favorite Child who graduated from Stamford University in science So no I will wait for 15
PASS I will keep my 11 pro max until iPhone 16 is out lol
Do you use a wallpaper app to find all those wallpapers
"Buying this iPhone in EU market right now is crazy due to EURUSD rate crush it costs a couple hundred more than it would be worth

Hoping the currency bounces back in a year or two and getting the next model at a more closer to US prices price"
This shit looks amazing
SoI know Im being pedantic but the word notch is the irritating name to me  A notch is a physical cutout an indentation or incision on an edge or surface  There is no piece cut out of the phone  Dynamic island as an identifiable portion of the screen real estate is more descriptive of that portion of the screen even though its nothing but pure slick Apple marketing  Before the 14 Pro it was just dead space not a notch
"Funny When android does it you call it a gimmick but when iphone does it its revolutionary 

MKBHD may as well collaborate with everything Apple pro Hes moving towards that direction"
Lil Observation They didnt had the Iphone 14 Pro Max yet so used 13 Pro Max so they lit it with purple light and tracked the front screen with masking I hope I am not wrong 
Couldnt you test the crash detection by throwing the phone out of a moving car
The dynamic island will hamper one hand use and will make front camera fingerprint magnet
it is me or this video looks like a publicitary video from apple
The always on display being in color is an odd choice I was really excited about it but I thought it would be like the pixel or moto X where it just had small whitegrey icons on a black background to sip battery Ill give it a shot when mine shows up but probably end up turning it off sadly What I love about always on displays was that it means I can check my notifications at a glance rather than having to grab my phone and look and pull me away from work
My man was so smooooooth in advertising the dbrand case 
As a samsung user This is probably the first time ever I may consider to switching to Apple Fighting the urge tho 
When they get to 15 they should go to Roman numerals and go back to iphone 1 Roman numeral
So I gotta wait for 15
I feel like the intro to this video really didnt get the bitrate it deserved Screw youtube compression
Dynamic Island  worst iphone strategy ever its make display so bad  looks like a cheap phn 
I literally like MKBHD vids before even watching them once again top quality video
As a android user Ive been tempted by the battery life of the 13 pros and now the 14 has actual solid improvements over the 13 but the one thing that just kills it all is the lightningport Usb c is just so usefull to be able to charge your speaker controller headset laptop and phone with 1 cable is amazing Ashame that they think differently
As always thanks for the excellent review Fun fact sometimes Ill watch you reviews in 480 to remind myself of old YouTube lol
Whats up Broski 
Most copied Some android phones had it for years Apple actually copied it and just modified it 
Im in so confused state Im using vivo without notch  with pop up camera But IPhone has notch is it worth for upgrading
blurry selfies have entered the chat
Give us the link of your wallpaper please 
"This review is skewed since we all know apple only works with YouTubers that wont really point out the obvious or talk bad about the brand

Hoping on other YouTubers real revews but i wouldnt upgrade this year"
at 1142 at the very top right isnt there also an indicator for mic Looks a little misplaced especially if its supposed to be sitting in the center of the dynamic island Or am I missing something
Anyone happen to have a link to that dope background
fantastic Intro
you dont want to say dynamic island anymore but then you go and say things like techtember your loosing points man
I am so annoyed with Apple taking features away Marquez please rant on the fact that Apple took away Live Photos from the Lock Screen Apple could still allow this if they would just allow the Live Photo to automatically play when you wake the phone You can still long press to customize the lock screen Please please please Rant about this to Apple
Apples AOD is disappointing
The more he explained it the more I realised I dont need an IPhone
drop the wall link
Unsubber not a word on the price hike for everyone else but the us why say a 1000 when you know fullwell thats just for the us Selloutt
"U are the best out there
i think u are one of veryyy small group of People with whoom I would screamm can i make a photo with can I make a photo with u

Im a sub since u were small with subs look at u now Bravo"
Do u also seethe mark left on his arm becoz of the applewatch
Upgrading to a 14 Pro Max from an 11 so excited I wrote a 6 month retrospective during lockdown 2020 and got it published might have to do the same for the 14
Alwayson can also reduce your battery and perhaps increase burnin no Thoughts
Dynamic island is a twohand feature
How odd that notch might feel while watching videos and playing games
If u have x111213 theres no point of upgrading
Marques please tell Andrew that we didnt want it hidden at the back What would the point of that be We want it bold and conspicuous
553 Who dat bear
"That new notch thingy seems really intrusive while watching a video

Far worse than the old notch"
Hope this only esim collapse becoz this is  not good remember every new thing Apple start every one follows 
Upgrading from my iPhone X is definitely worth it in my opinion my battery health is on 60 
Come on We got this before a fold or flip 4 review
Sweet mother of Cthulhu what an intro 
1330 LG V10 use secondary display aka narrow strip
Did I miss the battery section of the pro max
It definitely makes sense that long tapping would show a little widget of the music player while tapping it would launch it directly into the app Why wouldnt this make sense every function in iOS operates in this manner lol Weird take
You are a success of a YouTuber bro Damm Great numbers
So the US IPhone 14s will have no resale value on the used market because of its lack of SIM cards slot hence NewUpgraded buyers are buying the IPhone 13s like crazy driving up the prices for them
If they have 4 pixels of the same color how do they get the 48 mpx Is it interpolating the color from the nearby pixels or what Im amazed how no one talks about this because a photo diode can only sense light intensity so each diode in the pixel array is black and white and to get R G or B it has a filter over it which only allows that wavelength of light So did Apple invent a variable filter that can change its size to allow smallerlonger wavelengths of light so it can shift from 4 green pixels to 4 smaller RGB pixels or do they interpolate a physical pixels color based on the values of his neighbors
Too long video
Also I think they said the car crash thing only activates once it knows that you are in a car driving Otherwise it stays off That should keep accidental triggers like throwing the phone or accidentally drop it not trigger the crash detection SOS
"Tbh I hate the dynamic island as its brought the camera further down and looks like itll get annoying with full screen videos ect The iOS 16 update has the notifications come down around the island I I hate it Keeping my 13 Pro Max will the 15 hopefully they actually work away to finally get rid of it or 

Tbh Id have preferred the notch stayed and made the current one dynamic"
Im waiting for the line so Im been using   Err
Apple fanboy brownlee
Always love your down to earth matter of fact thoughts in your reviews
Should i uprade from 13pro max to 14 pro or wait 1 more year to 15 ultra whatever
"Notch  Welcome to 2016

Do you think the Notch will negatively affect sales"
"those finger prints on front facing camera though 1300 
dynamic fingerprint magnet"
looks crosseyed bends over  grabs wallet out of my ass ah hurr 1400  sounds like its worth it  cant wait for next year  lmfao
That intro is just insane 3
Wen I heard look at this graph  I was slightly disappointed not seeing Marques holding a printed graph Minor complaints though
The new phones are unimpressive and underwhelming at best Its just gimmics which were already there on other phones nothing new and nothing worth while Think im gonna skip this one and wait till next year Cant believe they marketed a glorified pop up display
Thanks for the review Not even half way through the vid and Ive already decided to stick with my 13 pro max lol Definitely not worth the upgrade imo
Waiting for Iphone 15 that would feature USBC nil notch and 120Hz screen
1403 I understood that reference
What a quality bro
Couse I m island boy
"Using iphone is drem of my life 
Because Im too poor"
Why is the intro quality so bad I was able to see the pixels I thought that my laptop screen had issues but then I watched your Tech Rewind 2021 video and I did not have any problem over there which mean your intro was not exported correctly
Amazing video and the transitions were just insane also shoutout to the dude who predicted the intro having the island transitioning to the i in iPhone
IMHO Dynamic Island is a decent execution of turning the hindrance of the notch into a kindof neat feature Is it a gimmick Yeah But at least the notch does more than just take up real estate Kudos not even mad
Is the front camera still at the top notch Thats one area I try to avoid touching but with the DIsland kind of hard not to 
Holy sht That 48mp raw shot looks astonishing and like a proper camera Im actually shocked Will definitely be using it occasionally in pro raw The camera on this phone is on another level
Finally I have a reason to POSSIBLY upgrade from my 11 Pro Max
"Dynamic island  D i  the i 

The renders were correct they were going to call it The i but Tim did not like that"
For these you tubers s22 ultra small camera hole effect watching movies experience but this big dynamic island doesnt do that none of these so called unbiased reviews mentioned it
Im still keeping my phone not worth the upgrade
can you use the 13 pros cases on this new 14 pro
So ipad faceID could unlock in vertical and my iPhone couldnt
raptor xl wow guess review coming soon
Is there any chance Apple can launch Iphoen 14 pro with sim tray in USAbecause the eSIM activation is not so easy other than US marketsas you said in case of roaming it will be difficult for travellersatleat secondary sim
Is it worth to upgrade from 13 pro to 14 Pro
I really dont see the point of upgrading to a new phone right after one year since ether last model released There really aint no giant leap in a lapse of a year if you really want to feel an upgrade Id say every 5 or 4 years you should upgrade your phone
The selfie camera is definitely slightly prejudice 
I never clicked so fast
Yea Ill pass on this one
With the esim only it will always remain findable when someone steals it they cant remove the sim so it will stay online
Dynamic island  notch
Mfr got ALPHA in three
The intro was amazing
Why is that guy standing like that in the background 1500
That was a great intro
Ill still buy the Iphoney max 24 Pro Plus from passionfruit over the Iphone any day of the week
eSIM to travel is not more complicated than a physical one Theres a bunch of providers that let you buy prepaid eSIM for a lot of countries There is already some website to compare all prepaid eSIM plan out there
Remember when phone companies tried to be original Me neither Hate hole punchesislandsnotches Also know every other equally unoriginal manufacturer is going to copy Apple like they always do and I just hate that because I dont want a stupid iPhone if I did Id gobble Apples crap and buy a stupid iPhone Wish phone companies would realize people buying notiPhones for the price of an iPhone do not want an iPhone clone
I love that we act like those of us on the ATT network wont be using that satellite feature on a weekly basis
Talk with apple Get them to a SIM card in the 14s
Dog was a paid actor
Im a dork and the dynamic island is legitimately making me want to buy my first iPhone since the 3GS Thats such a simple but fantastic idea
Definitely turning off that always on display
They cant get rid of the BIG notch and now they call it the DYNAMIC NOTCH
Its great how honest are your reviews Thank you for that first look
The dynamic island looks like itd be painful to use on the larger Max Thats a long stretch of the thumb
Dynamic Island is the worst thing EVER on any phones display Imagine watching videos in full screen lol
No it wontwe already have a status bar on Android Sighs
Instead of a Dynamic Island copied on every smartphone they other manufacturers should just put more effort into perfecting underscreen camera and display
Its the same as every year
trash
What is that location on the globe behind you on the left Marques
Im waiting until next year USBC new cameras plus the dynamic island should hopefully good enough to upgrade from the 13 Pro
iPhone is just a rip off  I will never buy apple products  They make them in sweat shops in Asia and sell them at such a high premium double the price of some premium Android phones  American profit driven corporate culture at display  repulsive
Isnt it Every year I phone tell this one have all day batteries  either they lie or didnt improve 
"Should I trade in my iPhone 12 Pro Max to Apple for 530 towards a iPhone 14 Pro Max 

Need some help deciding 
little FYI I am a full time photographer videographer"
Satellite connectivity is not only useful for stranded situations but it can very useful for basic communication in any place where theres no carrier connection like if you are going on a trail or a boat and you just need to update someone about your eta etc
I wish it would cost that 1099 but in Europe this year the price has been increased a lot As example I ordered the iPhone Pro Max 256gb and here the price is something like 1600 1600 The same model last year was around 1379 
and the microphones heard a loud noise what else can microphones hear without the owner knowing
I gotta say that intro was beautiful
Marques your voice sounds a little diff
What I really would have liked was a comparison to the iPhone 13 Pro Max battery life since the 14 Pro Max claims to be an hour longer
Imagine seeing Marques irl and not noticing which phone hes using
We want rather 24mp sensor on all lenses a closer telephoto 6k 60fps 4k20fps and all with lens switching while recording Thank you
Is it just me or was this intro diff quality than usual
bro squash the lantern fly dont just take pictures of it
One thing is sure about the crash feature dont go on a bumper car because the situation isnt going to be funny when an ambulance shows up
As someone who owns a 13 Pro Max best phone ever there is absolutely no single reason to upgrade
Id rather have no hole punch or notch than the Dynamic Island
can someone tell from to get that wallpaper marques has on his phone
Will interacting with the dynamic island result in the front facing camera getting blurry from all the touching on and around it
That intro was awesome
I just had to go grab my LG v10 and youre right Great review 
in the US its 1000 outside the US it starts from 1300 and so on
Hate the island Go notch less and island less and Im in Until then going to burn my 8 plus into the ground because I like the rectangle full scree
"Samsung laughing at apple

Also Samsung next year lets make a dynamic island"
RIP Dark Sky apparently its shutting down on 01012023
The Glass over the cutout can still have capacitive touch sense No need to go around Does he even research what he is about to say
As it relates to the always on display Its indeed the Apple way in that they only include it for the 14 model which is ridiculous I get that not much is different between the 13 and 14 but software limiting the 13 because you want the 14 to feel better is the most immature thing a company can do Apple really doesnt give 2 shots though so I guess my ranting is pointless
Ive an 11 pro and honestlynot feeling like Im missing out with the 14 pro Only thing is Im a photographer so the camera upgrade is very tempting Is that alone really worth the upgrade though Any thoughts
Did marques try the emergency satellite feature Just wondering because at 0816 you can notice the highest battery usage is by No Cell Coverage Or is it only because this was tested without a carrier 
Such a fluid intro
Damn that intro
where can i get that rubiks cube
Cool hoodie 
How did you make you calendar app icon bigger than the rest of the icons
Oh My God the photos are amazing
The OCKY WAY
I dont use plastic SIM card from the moment eSIM option was released Not only one time but many times happens to demagnetize an plastic SIM card and obviously when I need it most or when I dont have an quick option to change it Thanks to eSIM i have some years without problems
Love seeing the production team continuing to use the Laowa probe lens for those intros Exactly what it was meant to do
I remember pausing one of ur videos from last week to take a proper look at the back of the pone you were holding Something looked different about the camera cutout size
Where is that gorgeous wallpaper on his iPhone from
Can someone tell I have I phone 13basic did I need to buy 14basic
Nah Im still satisfied with my Xiaomi
Whats that  new battery indicator in the  video
the 20 remaining battery worries me a bit
Stop right there you are not gonna test that Come on dude whats the point of the reviewers if you dont 
"MKBHD rarely makes a mistake but here it is 

It wasnt clear when you said cinematic mode added for 30fps They added support now for 4k30 now Earlier it was just 108030fps on 13 pro Additionally they added support for the actual cinematic frame rate ie 24fps as well which I found would be much more useful "
Love the b roll about the todo list install inside joke
For me the dynamic island is a game changing feature Cant wait to experience it
Missed opportunity in the intro  i  in iphone couldve been lower case i by using the dynamic Island feature
Did Apple insult MKBHD in any way  He seems to bash them at every thing Lol
Awesome Now half the people I video chat will have fingerprints all over their cameras
I will definitely give it to apple for their marketing strategy when it comes to iPhones they are the best Something so small called a notch Im sorry I mean dynamic island can be this amazing 
Huh I think I might actually buy merch
800k views in 1 hour good job man
Notification Bar Dynamic Island  now like android
A Pro Review indeed
WALLPAPER 
There is no dead zone on the screen because theres a digitiser on top with the glass
Whenever MKBHD makes use of Allta in his intro it instantly makes it better
Floating Turd Hole
My question is how will emergency services react to the emergency call from a phone how will they know its not a prank
This dynamic island thing is just another gimmick It definitely has its uses but thats another feature i can live without I would personally chosen a hole cutout rather than this dynamic island which uses much more space than the notch does
The BIG problem about notch appears when watching videos  HOW dynamic  joke  will solve that 
Some other youtubers MR BEAST is on his way
So basically iPhone iis going to bankrupt all satellite based SOS companys
I prefer the aod on Android especially those on color os
The dynamic island is just brilliant Typical Apple fashion at its best
Where is the vidoe for the Z fold 4  
How do you feel about the Dynamic Island and one handed use of the phone  Are the interface elements such as buttons convenient to use with only one hand
Dont act like apple hasnt copied things themselves And pro res 128gb models are limited to 1080p 30fps is a joke
we miss you LG
lmao
Here we go again with unreasonable prices yet seeing small or no changes at allllstill the same with the iPhone 13 Sad me
No coverage of the cinematic mode Would like to see how its been improved
Who else noticed Marques installing yet another scheduling app Love these vids
The small array of pixels above the notch is ridiculous Its a mockery to your average consumer to label this as a  feature just make the notch smaller until its eventually eliminated Very stupid
smartphone industry is ded
Flossing 
E Sim has zero benefits Arent the pro and pro max identical aside from the physical size
There is no reason apple cant do dynamic notch for old phones  but they wont be makinh 
"Dont tell u have new iPhone 
Really 
They keep same design for every phone no one gonna realise u have new or old one"
Man the V10 was 7 years ago damn lol
What if its a bike crash
Wish you would have brought some attention to the increase in price pretty much everywhere outside the US
That into was so smart
Dynamic Island  It seems cool and VERY smooth to use However having to constantly interact with the very top of the phone to access the feature will get old VERY quickly especially on larger iPhone models Most people will be fascinated for a few weeks and then get sick of using it because it is an inefficient UX design
that intro music brought back memories 
Its a fancy notification shade
ESIM to physical SIM has me without 5G on ATT after weeks of customer service saying they have no idea This will be a nightmare in the USA
My iPhone Xr still works very well Im considering it but I can wait another year
Shout out to One Plus for having a highly customizable Always On Display
Dynamic Island lol What a terrible name Even when they come up with a good feature they cant give a cool name
At 829 you mention about having an Apple Watch on and walking away will turn the display off will walking back to it or coming near enough if an apple turn it back on then
I think you are not getting money from Apple 
Is this deep purple color
"The Dynamic Island is unconventional cause the fact that youre always must touch the notch and the camera is a twohanded annoying operation on the IPhone Pro Max Its odd that Marquez doesnt label this as a downside but thats probably because Marquez is a classic iPhone Fanboy 
Markus always had something to complain about when something was set too high eg with the Z Flip 3 for example that the volume buttons are far too high up but also for many other things are difficult to reach for onehanded use
And I really hope that other Companies dont copy that and if they want to then they have to put it on a reachable spot"
Great vid
best reason to get it if you need a brighter screen to fly your DJI and you love the hope that it wont dimm down in mid flight even though you are sitting in the shade
 dynamic glory hole is a copy of Huawei phone   Lmao
Dynamic island  Glorified widget 
ooo
What is the screen refresh rate Same as Pixel 6a
Dynamic island looks horrible It takes up way too much space and its gonna leave smudges on your selfie camera Imagine watching a video with a giant black island interfering with your video Horrible yuck 
iPhone 14 Pro still doesnt have Pro mode First always on display was in Nokia 6303 in 2008yr Pro Mode was in S7 in 2016yr Still 3x optical zoom for that price for iPhone 14 Pro S4 Zoom has 10x optical in 2013yr  Check the S22 Ultra photos WTF with you MKBHD Craig paid you the money It was not test it was Apple sheep review
Im all for the dynamic island stuff but is there any way to turn off the bouncy animation that it does whenever theres a change to that area  I dont have an iPhone 14 Pro in hand so I cant test this out so just curious if anyone else knows  Its friendly and all but its kind of a useless part of the animation
"The no just me 
Nope rest assured not just you lol"
Late Graduation back when Kanye had his sanity
4 years ago honor v20 phone also had a system like dinamic island  But its not as advanced as the iPhone  If you look at it like that dynamic island was first introduced in an android phone
Also following Samsung
That front facing camera is going to get MAD dirty
And since when are you using this as your primary device review duration please
I would know too i would know
 Im just surprised by the number of views in one hour
This phone looks pretty good would love to buy one
Why did the phone say SOS briefly 1037
Nice to see some evolution on the iPhone for once
another overpriced piece of sht waiting on mate 50 pro
Do you think the Dynamic Island feature can be turned off Like turning off the AlwaysOn Display
Youve used this intro song before haha Love it
"Does anyone know why did the apple devices became much more expensive in europe
ven the price of the iphone 13 had an increase instead of a decrease"
Dynamic Island  No its not gonna be copied
I really dont understand peoples fascination with always on display Didnt need it dont need it dont want it dont care
I dont see a reason for it
Apple following android Funny 
What is the calendar view widget on your Lock Screen Thanks for cool review though
I love the concept of the dynamic island but its not nearly enough to upgrade from my 12 pro max  Same with the apple watch ultra  Why only have one color Ill just keep  my black SS apple watch 4  Only thing worth getting out of the bunch is the air pods pro
Bro why you sound like its a new thing  The v10 did it like 8yrs ago hahaha
Excited to upgrade from an 11 to 14 Thanks for the great video review
713 that theee shott
iPhone 15 is the target  new design 256 base model pro lets gooo
So when I take this phone moutain biking its gonna think Im crashing every 3 minutes Great 
Indeed
I preordered the 14 from ATT   I just want improved battery and that it stays connected to my Toyota Bluetooth better
I can see being on a thrill ride triggering the accident mode Good idea in theory but in practice it can definitely be a nightmare if they havent thoroughly tested it
Youre not excited about the customization because you play around with 100s other amazing OSs   simply put GREAT REVIEW AS ALWAYS
I would still be paranoid about screen burn in with that always on display I always turn it off on my Samsung
I literally said what the hell when i saw the intro in a good way
"In iphone 14 reviews 
if you are not testing Satellite and crash test then it is nothing but iphone 13 review I gess"
11411143 what a transition 96 to 69 
Love to watch from India
Do you think that it will be possible in the future to disable the dynamic island having the two holes separated with the pixels turned on between them
I went with Deep Purple but the Space Black looks niiiiiice
Style over content video
I simply looove the DYNAMIC ISLAND xddd
Dynamic Island Boyz
Companies need you for commercials  another quality video
The sea gulls sound in the intro
 I just call the Dynamic Island DI it is much easy to say And it more in line with the phrase UI
Bro are you robbing editors from apple The beginning was really good
Even if I never use the satellite phone service it will give me peace of mind on overnight hikescamping
1500 I hope you payed this phenomenal model They killed it
Lol I cant with apple theyre swindling people with the products Smh
Dynamic Island isnt that extraordinary or an evolutionary technology such a minor feature and people are overhyped because Apple
Imagining removing the sim tray yet still wont implement a sd slot
"Yo those Kanye and Cole albums 

Born Sinner is my favorite Cole album "
Keep aside the iPhone 14 pro the best review and MKBHD video with a sarcasticfunny way i saw till now
You listen to Jcole My dawg
Can I disable the always on display
I love the hoodie because its technically my country flag Yemen
Why do people applaud screen distraction when the ideal is no distractions at all O want all screen for content consumption thats all If you like create a dynamic village to hide your poorly designed notch to fool fans Ive seen perfect face unlock without notches
Where can I get the wallpaper used in this video
Anybody have the Honor v20 with its dynamic hole punch
fixable glass back  whattt
Didnt plan on upgrading my 11has been giving me issues lately The Verizon agent told me 700 off with a trade in opposed to 400 off for a 13pro i thought itd be cheaper I was reassured that the 14pro would be slightly cheaper than going to last years model So I guess Im waiting for the 14pro now  not complaining but  unexpected
Its a big mistake to disable the sim tray card
Apple needs to hire your team to do their promos lol
Im still rocking my 11 pro and honestly I dont think I need to upgrade until iPhone 15 when they redesign the phone itself instead of copying and pasting the same design
 I have to give it to Marques lowkey pushing that right to repair agenda using an iPhone which Apple gave him as a review unit
Watching this on my flip in flex mode
the hoodie is FIRE
Apples ambassador is here
Funny all android user were making fun of iPhone
racist iphone why am i not surprised 
The new hoodie you wearing is much cooler than the iPhone 
I miss Force Touch I know they got rid of it to fit other stuff long ago Maybe Im alone in this forever i used it all the time
I wish I could be able to afford one of this 
1250 apple gonna sell cotton napkins to clean the selfie cameras
Although the dynamic island is an improvement over the hideous notch over the last few versions of the iphone it is still just a bandaid to hide the gigantic hardware at the top Creative yes but only out necessity Real creative will be when they can incorporate all that supposed incredible hardware beneath a full display Apple stopped innovating a long time ago
"Yeah that e Sim is sketchy 
Look at shiny  new thing but well take more control "
Its as if most of these youtubers dont even use other phones Almost all of the functionality of the dynamic island is in the s22 ultra Including calls headphone connections notifications etc The only ones it doesnt have are the utterly useless ones like navigation who the hell is looking at just a left arrow as navigation and the timer which is in the notification bar or as a tiny window in the s22 ultra I dont know why you guys let Apple get away with what has been stagnation for over 5 years The same chip with a boost in clock speed a very slightly better camera that nobody can tell the difference for half the RAM of other flagships a worse always on display that robs battery life for no reason despite others existing for literally a decade at this point and no other legitimate improvements Crash detection isnt even a hardware thing its completely software based and other companies will make apps for modern androids that can do the same There is nothing innovative new or even conceivably better about this phone It is just a cash grab that everyone keeps falling for Samsung can carry the same fault for this once a year garbage but at least additions are made year over year This is the same phone as the 13 and I seriously hope nobody buys it so they will actually have to improve Its genuinely upsetting to see people with the reach of this channel market this garbage Hope the Apple paycheck or whatever payment you get from this video is worth the soulless promotion of stagnation and greed
"Cinematic Mode was introduced as 1080p 30fps
whats new is 24fps  4k obviously"
Ugly notch is still there sorry dynamic island
"When Apple do it Its a refined update

When Android phone comes with 100 new things  This is basically the same phone we got last month 
"
Ill be keeping my 12Pro nothing on these past phones is telling me to upgrade Ill wait till its an actual change in these phones
I doubt Samsung will copy the ugly island
I have the 12 pro max and Im considering upgrading because of promotion and the much better battery If I had had the 13 pro max I wouldnt have even bothered
That intro was soooooo fuckingggggg coooooooooolllll
"Impressive
Waiting on hugh Jeffreys for the repairability"
I would wait for OnePlus to bring out a better designed version of the dynamic island for its Android phone OnePlus is really slick at design of its software and they would design something better than this but at a much more reasonable price
Got my deep purple coming Friday cant wait for my own island
Apple stop inovating long time
How do I get that calendar widget on the Lock Screen like he has Only thing I can get to pop up is an agenda but not that calendar graphic
LG v10  I hear bootloop
Wow you look so bored in this review
I really really hope people dont follow Apple in getting rid of the SIM card tray I like being able to just swap my SIM card between phones no issue Especially as someone who collects phones I want to be able to use them for a little and swap back anytime
"239 yeah we all know a certain bald guy with name starting with J will find a way to test the crash alert
As he always does"
I dont know why people are bitching about the eSIM It just makes international travel easier I travel international and Im sick and tired of popping out the SIM tray So goddamn flimsy and tiny You can have the SIM card activated before you arrive at your destination
I got to say constantly poking my front facing camera Idk I am not a selfie guy by any means but it just seems to be one thing that sticks out to me as wrong lol Hopefully this Dynamic Island feature will help with accessibility in some ways
iPhone 13 Pro pics look better from all the reviews iv seen so far
I miss my LG V10 and 20
"1 I wonder how the dynamic island effecting youtube video with 189 content as we know with iphone 13 pro a line of notch appear not tidy

2 Apple can easily make the old notch more dynamic with software but then they choose not to and introduce this new island 

3 Is this dynamic island takes more screen space than notch Or at least in naked eyes

Cant wait to test it on store "
"That was one of the most epic intros ever 
PS Choosing AllttAs Disarm fg VI was the cakes top cherry "
Dynamic Islamd is already done by Xi
"what a fantastic way of presentation I will surely email you to review my game when it will be launched
Thanks
Zipzy Games CEO"
I inadvertently paused the video at 1016 and got up to take a phone call On my way back I happened to look at my monitor and realized that Marques face in that particular frame had a kind of the Mona Lisa effect I moved around the room and from every spot it appeared that Marques is looking at me Eerie coincidence
Watching this on my 3 years old  OnePlus 7
Yesss the transition 
Im just now getting the iPhone 13 Pro itll be my first iPhone and im getting the feeling that iPhones are the 2kGames of the phone industry Releases a new product every year with only minor updates to the previous but what do I know
I actually had to go look at your lg v10 review
1924 that wouldve  been great
im buying this phone
"ADVICE PLEASE
Ok friends Im currently running with an iPhone 8 which is dying and Ive had countless issues with since I got it and Im debating making the jump to the 14 Pro Id love to hear from other people who probably know more about the actual tech and see what you guys think I should do

 Im on my phone all the time always watching or listening to something in the background
 I love taking photos and prefer to use my phone rather than lugging my dslr around
 Ive always wanted the pro but could never justify spending the  on it

But Im also super cheap in the sense that dropping 1200 with apple care on a phone gives me anxiety Is now the time to go pro Or should I go with the 13 instead TIA"
Samsung will copy Apple with remove the SIM card tray also mark my word
Still waiting for the Mercedes Maybach 
Fun fact  miui theme developer in China has already implemented dynamic Island on their upcoming theme which is launched in China themes app and soon going to be launched on global themes app
No close all apps yet Come on apple yall have amazing features and hardware to be able to do this how hard is it to have users be able to just have a close all button or lock apps that you dont wanna close
I  your shirt and I have it 
8k video is not necessary when a lot of people dont even have 4K tvs yet
I cant justify going from a 13 PRO to a 14 PROnothing interests me besides the dynamic pill 
Trying to take a picture of the Moon is dogwater on the iPhone Not sure if it got any better with the new phone
"this intro wasnt like mkbhd intro quality
i dont know wut im saying but like this doesnt hit like ther other intros which are hyped up and elegant"
Throw in into a backstop as hard as you can
Im sure someones already said it but cinematic mode was always 30 it now supports 24 and 30  cant wait to get mine on Friday And see the new auto focus vid
700000 views 1 hr after posting is CRAZY
The swapping apps on the dynamic island is awesome
Use Ongoing Thing as intro for your favorite iPhone release this year
A new phone for a new year is an increasingly depressing reality
Overpriced
wait so does an iphone 13 pro max case fit an iphone 14 pro max
Another 10M views everyone who has money will buy one bt still watches the review
Finally saying MIUI right
Did anyone else notice Marques say Connecting AirPods twice at 1106 and 1115 for the features of the dynamic island lol not a big deal I just thought it was funny
Everything about the iPhone 14 is overhyped Very very few people use these phones to the max to understand the performance camera etc Phones have been taking great photos for a long time To look at photos this deeply is also not normal
That function is not worth it for me to upgrade from the iPhone 13 Pro the 13 pro already take good enough pictures is fast enough the battery last long enough and the screen is good too
Contemplating on whether to upgrade to a 13 Pro Max or 14 Pro Max This video helped me decided to get a 13 Pro Max not a massive difference between the two
That intro though 
"The lack of sim tray is not going to be a prob very soon I use the app Airalo recently for e sim use in different countries and its hella convenient 
The tech is there Apple is just going to accelerate the move towards it as they always do"
Intro approved by Apple fo sho
Dynamic island is such a gimmick in my opinion The placement is so high that its pretty inconvenient to use Android has had floating notifications for years and you can move them around instead of being it all the way on the top I personally turned it all off cuz it gets a lil annoying to look at after a lil while
The most apt backdrop setup  the globe with the blue bubble depicting iMessage and the pill shape of it for dynamic island also guess the reason why its pinned on globe specifically that place i guess thats island portion  Rest all is marques stuff the Mac the Matt black surfing borad interestingly which also gives us an island vibe reason Island beach surfing
The name dynamic island just makes this  fearure 3x more interesting
Shouldve called it Dynamic iLand
Funfact This is copied from apple because xiaomi had this island before
"Lets gooooooo
Honestly never cared about Always On
It just bothers me if I lock my phone I dont wanna see it"
I have an Iphone 8 Plus  I think I can upgrade now Wife but does your phone still work Me ANC ON
I hope you killed that lantern fly
mkbhd you said connecting airpods twice in what the dynamic island can do
Whats the widget that you have on the lock screen Looks sick
I love how he cringes every time hes forced to say Dynamic Island
i love that marques isnt about messing around with emergency services unless its necessary
Im just waiting on someone create the Dynamic island app
I think its a good update
Well that intro was something everyone was waiting Shoutout to the entire team for the amazing transition and well everyone had guessed it would have to something with the Pill but marques did it the apple way  the interactive pill 
So did you floss
The dynamic island wont get copied the coloured always on will be though
"Anyone else get fall notifications from apple watch after dapping up someone 
Dap up your car for crash testing "
I would like to get Notifications in the dynamic island view
"Thank you Marques Now Ill thing harder about which iPhone to get Thanks for this review
Also the graphics are a really nice added touch"
The initial announcement of the aod lock screen I loved Now it shows too much is too bright and uses too much battery  has been ruined for me personally The dynamic island is way over hyped for me personally as well Long holding it for the widget is backwards Gesturing for quick navigation at the bottom of the phone is quicker than taping small icons at the top So for me personally its a pass
Salla Kitnii Bak Bakk Krtaa Hey  Technical Sandeep Maheshwari He Ye 
There is absolutely nothing about this phone that makes it worth an upgrade It is in all functional ways the exact same as the 12 and 13 it is only different on paper and the only people that will notice this are tech YouTubers and people that are reviewing the phones No normal person is going to notice any difference in this iphone 104 They have been selling the same phone since September 12 2018 and people are just eating it up and giving apple a new 1000 for a phone every year all just for features that they will never use or notice These kinds of phones need to stop it is a joke to consumers and the advancement of the tech world Its not advancement for humanity or curiosity it is only the bare minimum to legally sell the same thing over and over for years on end This phone just like the last few years of apple releases has been a massive disappointment
Am sticking to my iPhone 11 Pro Max  might wait for the 15 or even the 16 I want a new design
Im such a simp my fav part is the number in the battery
Ey shout out to the guy who edited the intro Sick
Also will be a hassle if the phone breaks you dont have the option to put SIM  in anotherold phone
All I care about is Apple Watch ultra for this year
I think those are the aspects every year of what is new of the iPhone
Dynamic island is shit as you can swipe down to access everything
My boy MK drops a video and an hour later its got a million views Thats insane dude
Next year will be usb c 8k  other features
Amazing review as usual I really thought the camera differences would be more substantial But one question wasnt 24 fps the new frame rate for Cinematic Mode
I want that iPhone 14 I got a iPhone 6s my iPhone be tripping big big big fan
Awesome review as always Marques Honest and dope take towards the end Not into iPhones though but still very informative stuff
Link for wallpaper please
Those selfies are going to be smudgy as hell
145 you should charge your phone
I wonder if youre on a roller coaster will it think you got into a car crash
Remember guys the intro music has only been used when iPhone X launched MKBHD got 10 million subscribers and this Says a lot
MKBHD INTROS ARE DOPE  
The background sound of seagulls while showing the dynamic island Nice touch
apple takes old tech and makes it look like a whole new different tech amazing
"You know nothing has really changed when the most exciting new feature is the dynamic Island 
Like seriously the bottom three buttons on 90 of phones already swap things like the multitasking features marques loves so much"
I wonder if the crash detection triggers on a rollercoaster
I think the real target of the sattelite antenna is for parallel imports to certain eastern countries  making the iPhone the new SpiPhone
Samsung not falling for Apple scams
I still have a 10S been waiting for something worth upgrading for 120hz would be nice but not really a game changer Honestly the feature Ive been waiting for is a thumbprint scanner on the lock button to unlock the phone That addition would do it for me Still might get a 14 though that camera is miles ahead of the one I have now
iPhone at it again Is it just me or have you also noticed that iOS 16 drains your battery faster
The INTRO stole the show AGAIN
Lo mejor fue el Hoodie de Chevron 
what will you naming front camera and face id combo then
1422 Marques You gotta start understand Aperture and Sensor Size The camera upgrade is minimal if at all Do some research or check out Tony Northrup Video about it
people are hyped about they can now customize their  screen clock and all is all been there in android from way baaackkkkkk guysssss
This will be copied You mean the thumbnail Similar hand holding the phone on another channel Nice little jab 
Waste of money to buy it for daily use
Thank you for your review 
Hi Xiaomi has allready a phone with this feature Maybe they had it in development before Iphone or they just copied it from Iphone Cheers
You make the best tech reviews Jidion 
Kill the lantern fly
LG sounds Terrible
You wouldnt be spending 1000 on the new iPhone as you would be trading in your old phone which can be worth as much as 500 or anything else you might want to trade in to subsidize cost
please make a review on Motorola edge ultra and motorola 30 edge fusion
I dont think you look over exposed in either the examples you showed The one in the car even looks darker than the camera you are talking to throughout the video
Remeber those goofs Im an island boy
better than the fuxxxng notch
"1737 No Marques RANT NOW We NEED TO HEAR IT LMAO 
Why on Gods green earth is that lighting jack still on a PRO PHONE and PRO airpods
They IPhone when they finally switch to USBC I will purchase that phone in a heartbeat Until that day Im holding out"
yay another video D
Continuously impressed by the production quality standard you and your team hold yourselves to Seriously the best tech channel on YouTube
When Samsung placed fingertip sensor next to the camera lens everyone knocked out Samsung Now Apple make you touch front facing camera multiple times a day and wow what a great idea We all now that apple dont have bad reviews
But is it better than my iPhone 8 Plus with Touch ID
anyone know what that grid lock screen widget is
qabar ki garmi kese jhelogy
God damn that intro
People have been bitching about the notch for years and they decide to make it more obnoxious
whats the calender widget on his lockscreen
this introI love it
Im not that impressed
hate apple software xd android is sooo much better i only got an iphone13 caus it gets 10 years of updates 
The intro is 99 perfect Marquees should have erased that phone holder
Thoughts on the price hikes in every country other than US and China 50 more for the Pro and 150 more for the Pro Max in the UK
1000 is ONLY on the US In europe its 1450 Should have mentioned that
Disappointed about the always on display I was looking forward to using it but it sucks if it used too much battery more than 45 is too much imo I wish it would just show clock and notifications like android
Suggestions on pro vs pro max
Paid by Apple lmao
"God made the universe

Marques So ive been living in this universe for almost a week now

God W H A T"
1452 nice watch tan
LG came up with this 7 I repeat 7 years ago but Apple are the innovators and LG no longer makes cell phones I wonder how tech influencers could have covered this device 7 years ago to emphasize true innovation instead of kneeling at the throne of Apple and acting as if when they wait to do something its because they do it perfectly Consumers and the general space suffers because of this herd mentality
Fun Fact we have the same wallpapers
So glad you gave LG a shoutout I had an LG V20 years ago and always thought the top screen was underrated This just feels like that but like modern and sleek
the intro damn
So its the same phone as the last Got it
Link to the wallpapers pls Ty
The Intro killed and crushed every other intro on this channel Id argue 70 of this videos budget went into the intro Im curious what Apple did with the extra space left by the sim tray cause previous iPhones had an esim Did they put a bigger battery for the US or something If so Apple is nationalisist 
What a lovely intro
"bro how do you get 750k views in an hour 
love your content btw xD 
keep on moving forward"
Im interested to see how people test the crash feature I wonder if you have to hard brake for any reason would that constitute a crash If it did and your phone is in your bag or purse because you dont take it out while driving what will happen
Apples creativity and innovation died with Steve Jobs
A developer already made a dynamic island for xiaomi Gotta love Android developers W can literally have anything an iPhone has 
Most useless feature like you have no idea youre in a car crash without the watch lol
built by forced labour and child labour
Yes thats right on a tap it should show the widget and on a long press it should open the appThe great dynamic island
Wow lg invented that dynamic island 7 yrs ago
Lol so The iphone camera is so GOOD now You took a picture and i bust out laughing Im like i never have seen a DOGS LIPS  lol Like i just discovered dogs have lipslol Amazing Video bro Always  amazing
why would you reach your finger all the way to the dynamic island and long press when you could just swipe down to see the media player in the notifications i dont know if ios has that but this feature would make things worse if it was implemented on android
The dynamic Island seems like a cleverly marketed resell its not that different from how every modern phone uses UI and software to make all these occuring things like charging calls spotify and so on fit in the top or bottom taskbar With apple they simply made it part of their notch and marketed it as revolutionary I dont really think its that impressive if I have to be honest
I hate this island
why would anyone use always on that will just cause burn in
I still cant afford the iPhone 13
Actually the 1st company introduced the  Dynamic  Concept to to beautify the hole on the screen is Huawei
Yes this need to be copied
Does the iPhone 14 Pro use PWM Is it much better than 12 13 Or it flickers crazy
Dynamic island is cool but wtf they gon do when they finally get rid of notch Remove that feature
Should I upgrade my iPhone
I want no notch We are stuck with this design for another 5 years minimum
Di is just plain gimmick
Test the crash detection using remote control car if possible
Apple says they made the hole punch even though Samsung created it on the Galaxy S10
9 1 4 2022
Its crazy that were suggesting 8K video on phones Like take a step back and think about how our phones are the most powerful devices weve ever had
"The fact that Marques could bring an unannounced iPhone 14 to the public for few days or perhaps weeks before the reveal already tells you a lot of things

1 The design changes is minimal and not impactful to tilt peoples heads to it
2 People whos interested in iPhone  Apple products doesnt give a shit about what Apple products you have They only cares about what they have"
Ok hear me out Been a Samsung guy for over a decade Thought about going iPhone so I watched this annnnnnd this is not convincing to say the least  Like iPhones are late to everything and less customizable I just dont understand the hype behind them
Even Samsung thought Apple would be doing astral photography 
So essentially if you have an Iphone 13 pro just update IOS and youre already 95 of the way there
That dynamic island just another move from apple to cover their lame progress from me iphone user
My 13 Pro came with eSim from Tmobile I thought it was normal but apparently not
Should I upgrade from 13pro Max 
Already got a sideloader app to install in android with dynamic island feature
mkbhd Didnt really talk about battery life
What are your widgets They look nice
Is the 14 Pro Max the same exact size as the 13 Pro Max So we can use the exact same cases
Apply implanting a feature for GPS on the dynamic island is a horrible idea It only encourages people to be on their phones more while driving Everyone who has an iPhone will most likely have Bluetooth or some form of connection to their car Apple literally just said lets shrink the GPS to make it harder to see while driving so people have to look away from the road for longer
Notice when he says connectivity he says it weird Sounds like hes being a smart ass with apple Lol
im really hate when IPhone user say always on in next level cmon
ios 20 intro
so it sucks  got it  15 pro will the the shit
I think he didnt got paid enough As this more of criticism video than unboxing
Still there is no night video mode it sucks taking video at night in 13 pro 
This wont be copied by anyone cause Apple copied this from samsung S10 released in 2019
If USBC came to the iPhone 15 what advantages would it bring Im not very well versed in phones so if anyone could educate me that would be appreciated I dont understand the issue people have with the lightning port Thank you
Classic Marques So Ive got this unreleased phone for about a week now Brownlee
nope
What is that dot widget on the lock screen
Not great actually 
Damn its been a minute since you used Disarm for the intro again
To whoever in the studio made that intro just bravo That was gorgeous
Dynamic island seems great
so when apple copies something its late but when they do it first everyone else copies
You could probably swap out the numbers 13 and 14 for 12 and 13 in the first 90 seconds of this video and backdate it for 2021 and itd probably still work
Hoody FIRE
So in 2x are you still binning Or does it not do the binning in that mode
RESPECTING TO THE DYNAMIC ISLAND SAME MUSIC FROM THE VIDEO OF MKBHD OF APPLE DESIGN LEAP OF IPHONE X  GREAT EASTER EGG
Dynamic Island is cool little thing and Apple did a good job showcasing it But I see really no real advantage to it as its way up at the top of the phone As someone who does a lot of stuff onehanded and has set up my phone to make things easily reachable that way I dont care about dynamic island looks cool thats about it Dont need it up there for me
So the 14 13 and 12 is basically the same
Can someone plz tell me if I buy a US iPhone 14 variant will it work in India Also Iwatch ultra if u can plz let me know
LG please come back 
1247 those animations are suuper fun this is beyond any animations I have ever seen on smartphones
I hope they wont do the esim only part outside US because I already tried it wayback in ipXs and I really dont like it I cant use my sim to a nonesim phone
Best way to feel the upgrades made on new phones is to change every maybe 34 years If u got a 12 pro theres very little incentive to get the 14 pro for example
Im getting iPhone 14 pro max Deep Purple 512GB in late November
As always sick vdeo intro
Lol youve got the wawa app
undefeated intros
Broke me enjoying this video and still knowing i cant afford it 
No dont copy The thing is they couldve done a UDC and before you comment but the quality is bleh bleh bleh I bet you didnt realize there was another sensor beside the front facing camera of the fold 4 and it is hardly noticeable So Apple couldve just left out the camera so this whole island is just an islet punch hole
Programmer here what apple does for the crash detection is pretty simple if autocrash  true  sendAlert 
Your dog looks like a annoying breed
The phone has a Dynamic Forehead not a dynamic island
The throwback to some of the songs you used to use all the time was great Took me back a few years Loved it 
Was that seriously an upbeat dance version of I cant make you love me in the intro
So I am touching the camera cut out again and again Is it going to leave a scratch
ESIM is US only That worries me for how apple will handle the EUs usbc regulations
Dynamic is some terrible UX design cant reach with one hand put finger prints on the cameraand so on
The satellite message service is free for the first 2 years I wonder what happens if they decide to not keep it free and charge you for that Imagine needing the service only to not be able to use it because you dont have Apple One or something like that
Very gimmicky  i have the 13PM and this is NOT an upgrade   next
Best Video so far concerning 14 Pro Thanks Love the wallpaper Is it original for the 14 Pro
Ahh you said it yeah it was invented by the lg v10
Marques your content is unmatched bro No one comes close on this platform
"Lets be honest the 14 pro max isnt a big enough upgrade to move from 13 pro max lmao Ill just stick to the 13 pro max 

Honestly if you have a older upgrade to the 14 but if you have 13 pro max then its not worth the upgrade "
Isnt that background song copyrighted
Im glad they finally put the actual number back into the battery icon
Solid as always
You mean to say 4k 24 fps right
Ive been a MKBHD fan since last 8 years And this guy never disappoints Great Video Holmes 
when the Intro is like a spotbeautiful
iPhone 113
Why Iphones still not coming with CType port
I think the SIM card tray was removed to feminist after market prices in poorer regions
Dont quote me on this but I predict Dynamic Island will come to MacBooks
me falling from hill apple oh wow you trekking bro
Surprised that he didnt mention about smudging the front camera when using the Dynamic Island Noticed his finger did go over the front camera and leaving marks on it when he was demonstrating the wonders of the Dynamic Island
Loved the introooo damnnn
Daaaamn that iphone intro is top notch
that intro holy smokes yall are getting better by the video wow 
Thanks for the review I disagree Satellite coms is not really an edge case Lots of people go on hiking trips to places like Montana and Utah where devices like the Garmin inReach are utilized
it is great but i think im just gonna upgrade to a 13 or a 13 pro now my 11s battery is beaten down and my screen also broke plus the new iphones are like 300 more expensive than the last gen in europe so noope
I am now wondering if you can make the AOD not show the lockscreen and just be mostly black like in Android Showing a dimmed out lockscreen seems to be a waste of battery to me and I really am hoping the AOD can be as good as Android because it was one of the things that kept me from swapping
I really hope the island thingy will come to base models one day
Theres already 3rd party apps on the Playstore with this
I want to see the threshold
when will the apple watch ultra video review come out
No need of NDA because no one will notice anything  its looks same thats sums up everything thanks for a very honest review 
ugh this old intro music was a great throwback 
The fact that you cant say its the same as the 13 makes me feel like you were paid for it
I really like the dynamic island feature a lot My new favorite game will be try not to touch the front camera area of dynamic island to avoid having to constantly clean the camera Im still going to use it though
Same StDifferent Air Freshner
Dynamic islands background sound
Is the phone noise cancellation feature on with this one It was omitted in the 13 series and Apple never cared to give us an update
Now it just needs type c chargers
the camera upgrade on apples one flagship phone has been a part of my budget phone from 2 years ago
They should have named the dynamic island fantasy island
Imagine jailbreaking and tweaking the shit outta this phone but apple is annoying for not allowing it Jailbreakerss please figure this out
What does the dynamic island do in landscape mode I have seen one person ask this question at the demo and no one showing it Im sure we will see it once the phones release but it would be great to see it covered
Hope your knee is ok great review on how nothings changed but the island seems dynamic
Even Marques fell for it
I love how everyone is waking up to the reality that apple is very stagnant
A 20 minute MKBHD video Hold on let me get my blanket and a snack real quick
If Android had done this first and it worked just as well no one would give a crap The only reason this is such a cool feature is because of Apples amazing advertising team that makes dynamic island look so good In reality its a bigger bezel at the top of your screen thats just there for looks and you cant even turn it off
2000 Nits is a miracle but how long will that last before the display dims due to temperature
That INTRO is absolute 
"Asks for always on FOREVER then doesnt use it Hates on apple for a freaking marketing name 

Remember people this is why we just cant have and enjoy nice things "
The dynamic island is not just a stupid name its also a stupid feature which will leave finger prints on your front camera lense The only worthwhile features on the iPhone is the always on display mostly for increased battery life emergency satellite connectivity and perhaps the car accident detection Deleting the sim car will definitely turn off more than a few customers but for the majority it will be similar to deleting the 35mm aux jack I have an iPhone 11 and I dont plan on upgrading as the benefits are marginal at best My iPhone does everything I need it to do plus some
my brother pre ordered the iphone 14 pro max in the space black color for me but accidentally said the 128GB instead of the 256GB i wanted Should i return the phone and get the 256GB or stick with the 128GB
Does it have the ANC which they removed it
how is nobody thinking about how dirty the front camera will get
Can I order 1 iPhone 14 pro Giveaway please
You missed the flash upgrade 
Whaaaat an intro 
Does the tempered glass have to cover the front camera
I feel like next years iPhone 15 models theyll walk back the physical SIM card issues I guess itll depend on how many iPhone 14s they sale in US Im not against ESIM I use it on my iPhone XR but majority of people will want their physical SIM card slot
That esim thing without a sim slot is driving me crazy Worried for international trips
"Apple created the most ugliest Punch hole ever Tried to hide it with software aesthetics Praise it public and name it Dynamic island

Do we look like a fool"
The oilly fingerprint stack on this Dynamic  island would be nightmare for face idPlz dont got me worng
Just 15x zoom  atleast make it 30
The new things he mentioned at the beginning are always then same new things lol
Do you need to clean your front facing camera before using it Seems like you keep pressing on the camera when using the island
Im due for a new iPhone this was very helpful Thanks
So confirmed it fits in a 13 pro case
Do you still cube Ive seen cubes in quite a few of your videos Also love the Tesla surfboard in the background lol
I mean its already copying the S22 Galaxy phone so of course this device will be copied as well from other companies Lmao  its bound to happen and if Im correct didnt Samsung started the little circle front facing camera thing And if they diddid they ever Paten it Since it was on like almost every other phone companies phone after Samsung hmm 
I  will stick for one more year with my 11PRO  max model nothing majorly  change since then
YouTubes compression is horrible Im watching this video at 4k but the intro looks more like 360p or 480p
Not yall complaining about iPhones not having AOD and then say Im just going to turn it off smh another gimmick from android like we been saying
Wallpaper please mkbhd
Thinking about it dynamic island is the same thing as pop ups when u get a message it pop up thats the same thing as dynamic island js
camera king among iphones  maybe cant compare it to huawei p30
Wouldnt you dirty the front facing camera touching it all the time 
Wait until some user next year report aod cause burn in oled display maybe
If you cant kill it camouflage it 
apple watch ultra really seems like a good deal for people like me who goes to different places to do different indoor or outdoor activities
Why do if feel like we keep buying the same iPhones every year
Laughs in old phones
Exaggerating  is only
I loved my LG V20 until it died on me and move on from it
Did he release the galaxy foldable phone reviews yet
Gotta say MKBHDs cameras do a good job
why do  notifications have tobe at the bottom ofthe screen
Marques just dropped a bomb with LG inventing the dynamic island before Apple
I love his selfie game
Every Tech YouTuber  Never forgets should you buy or not question
Im gonna call it the super notch
Another pro for esim when someone stole your phone they cant physically remove your sim to disable your phone network
Ive had an iPhone 8 for a while now and I havent upgraded so I know it may have many similar things to the 13 but for someone who hasnt been able to test out the new features of iPhone than I feel like for me its best I upgrade but thanks for the info really helpful information
330 and the heart rate sensor stopped detecting anything
All nice and well but I dont feel it deserves 22 whole minutes of my life 
Be ready with lots of lots of fingerprint on front facing camera 
I get that there are complaints that aside from a few new features its practically the same phone but thats only a problem for a select few people Ill be upgrading from an 11 so this is more than enough new perks to justify the purchase If youre upgrading every year it makes more sense but that definitely isnt most people
Front camera going to be hella dirty 
Sad to see there is no complete review of Fold 4 by Marques
Hope this year Iphone 14 Pro or 14 Pro Max  will win smart phones award  camera test in MKBHD
Did you remember to floss
What about 3 background apps
Its hilarious that no one is talking about the screen burn in that this absurd AOD will cause
Dynamic island makes no sense based on this video you put smudges on your selfie camera and to interact you need to reach to the top of your phone which is clumsy
"from reviewing moto x style to iphone 14 times have changed also sony 4k display phones  guess 22 reached the peak
Guess now we need new tech that will make smartphone obselete"
Can you disable to black pixels in the pill to make the sensor and camera look separated
"In some European countries the iPhone 14 Pro is 450 450 more expensive than the iPhone 13 Pro Making the iPhone 14 Pro an extreme tough sell
The iPhone 13 Pro 999 is actually priced CHEAPER than the base iPhone 14 1050"
Apple has run out of ideas This might be the first time theyve really only upgraded the components and left everything else the same
You have a hole on the screen its ugly
I wonder if going on a roller coaster could accidentally trigger car crash detection
 still waiting for the 45x sizes
Link for wallpaper
That intro i have been stuck on it i swear i will watch the video eventually but that intro though
Unpopular opinion  apple havent really been the same ever since Steve I have been an apple user ever since the first iPad came out and looking at the innovation and the rate of change and the way it has slowed down in the past decade is saddening Apple dont innovate or make life easier anymore The entire idea when Steve was there was that every update and every launch had a motive of change and making the users life as easier as possible and advancing it There are only a handful of products launched by apple thatve actually been able to meet the standards that Steve have left of it Imo the last iPhone that was actually top notch and amazing was the iPhone 5 series Every phone after that has just been boring and not as amusing and remarkable as it were made to be I hope this changes though there is no light ahead in this reign of apple
wouldnt there be smudges on front camera if we keep touching it
I have a iPhone XS Max lol I think its time to ypgrade
wished you would have talked a bit more about the battery life
Although the island is just a software gimmick everyone will copy it just because its apple 
Buying day one
Thanks for another great review Marques The improved camera system does tempt me I think Im going to stick with my iPhone 13 Pro Max for now Youre spot on with iOS16 being as big of a UX bump as the new hardware
I miss the glory of IPhone 4 and 5s
THIS MUSIC
That intro is creative af
if you got a problem cant be resolved just do some makeup and show it proudly to the world
I was holding on to upgrade to iphone 14 the most wanted feature is USB C charging
Wow 12 mp shots looks better than 48 mp
Booooooooooooo iPhone booooooooooo
that intro
This is a very good review Thank you for your honesty opinion always man
So excited to get mine on Friday
This one was a weird video i dont know why
Worst AOD realization I ever seen
this mans intros are simply second to none Incredible Also I remember thats the song from iPhone X review good days
Its my dream but im poor 
Damn that intro deserves a like
This has to be the most underwhelming Apple phone review I have seen
Is it worth upgrading my 12 pro max
I mean saying the LG V10 did it first is a little bit of a reach but okay
I dont know why but audio is not coordinated
Can it detect Bike crashes too
Man the nostalgia in the intro score Damn
How about calling it The DI instead of Dynamic Island
essentially its the same as the iphone 13
Marques please dont make a video on a base iPhone 14 just post your video with new thumbnail just like apple did
The noch looks better but from an android perspective I just think a notification that just dont go away
"Tech youtubers seem to be overlooking the fact that features like Dynamic Island need a name because they have their own custom API that we developers use Even if they hadnt decided to use the name for customers we would have needed it so we can hook into it The name is basically descriptive in this case its an island in the screen an you can do dynamic stuff with it

In terms of the creativity making the best out of a hardware limitation and the branding Dynamic Island lets not complain For Apple enthusiasts we have to admit this might be the most Apple thing theyve done in a decade This level of clever design is what I can hope we see from them going forward its what used to set them apart

Side note I also hope we see it on the next MacBook Pros I dont mind my notch but a smaller pill in the menu bar would be more discreet"
Actually Dynamic island hide more information from the screen than the notch 
nearly a million views in an hour
Apple running outta ideas fast
All those fingerprints on the front camera what a miserable solution Its also at the top of the phone where I will never use my thumb to interact with I liked it during the first impression but seeing it really used I just dont see how im supposed to get my thumb up there and constantly be wiping the fingerprints off
Dont care what the haters say or how similar it is to the iPhone 13 pro ok paper Im getting it   Looks nice Waiting for pre order but no tracking number yet With all the trade in and upgrade deals how can anyone not afford it Dont forget 0 financing at phone carriers
Ive had the 12 Pro since launch and just dont feel the need to upgrade yet
Quick prediction Selfie camera will always be smudged Lonely Island is just another gimmick
"WOWW  an amazing intro
best Intro EVER"
How about putting that phone inside an RC and try to emulate the crash and see it that works maybe
Funny how you mess up so many facts and specs on the iPhone 14 You said several times that the iPhone 14 now has sensorshift while ALL iPhone 13 already had it and now youre saying that Cinematic mode now supports 30fps No It did that previously Now it support 24
"THE POINT about slow Lightning port makes no sense

No one is using Lighting or USBC to move the files from the phone You use WiFi 6 for that it is much faster than both in practice"
I deadass was left dumbfounded when he brought up LG v10  1322
the fact that LG and Samsung manufacturers apples displays is really ironic
You think the upgrade is worth it from an iPhone XS
Bro these intros  they are absolutely insane
1010
So no ones going to mention that he really drops the new iPhone 14 pro People here mustve all been rich
Im dumping my s22 ultra for this iPhone I have so many issues with damn phone Absolutely done with android
Its getting harder for Apple to justify an 1100 dollar purchase when the iPhone doesnt really look or act different than its previous models Now iPhone has better tracking features to pinpoint your location Do you like how they sell that as a feature when you need help
I think Apple is ass
Whoever gave the idea of the dynamic island being the i in iPhone he actually used it and it looks class
"Some upgrades 
High pricing in india"
 Im island boy  
In a few words iPhone 14 Pro its not a enough upgrade I have a XR Im gonna upgrade to a 11 or  12
What apple way Those animations for AOD have always been there Also material you had a better lock screen animation introduced last year
Android might have done things first but theres no one android phone that combines everything in one package the way iphone does Amazon might have a phone with an amazing camera but then the battery is crap lol Or itll have an amazing screen but womp womp lame camera Or old chip Thats what android people fail to notice lol
All the effort to ease the hand strain of reaching the top of the screen undone in one dynamic swoop
What if Apple is coming up with its own carrier as well
i belive still better my iphone 11 pro
I decided to wait for next years samsung z flip 5 and not get the iPhone 14 pro max I hope I made the right choice  
LG V10 supremacy
1325 wow
not only the battery hit by that weird aod but screen burn in after a time oled is oled and that doesnt seen to be executed in the right way not surprised if the pixel 7 gets a dynamic island now is cool idea but with just an camera cut out gonna looks way better
the upgade in numbers is really impressive I wonder if the real diffrence between the 13 pros camera and 14 pro is as drastic Tony  Chelsea Northrup have grate vid about that Im courious how the 13s and 14s pro raw compare
One thing about Iphones is that the software does not stagger like in other operative systems fluidity is the word speed and things just work is the word when you want something done fast is natural and immediate
I have to shout out mrmarques for the editing it was amazing 
Genuinely hope no other manufacturer will copy the notch
Man you are so clever and honestly the quality of your content is superior to the phone itself  Nice try but believe me as you have chosen Pro instead of Pro Max for review we all know that using dynamic Island on bigger screen needs both of your hands also it will interrupt whenever it shouldnt be there specially in landscape mode but it is a good marketing effort to make people hyped for buying this 
Id love to go broke just to have alwayson display lol SMH and the island is such a gimmick Wake up
I dont why but iPhone 13 pro made me more hyped than the 14 pro Only thing I liked about the 14 pro is dynamic island
Yes absolutelyCloning
New notch is annoying if youre watching a video is way uglier than the previous notch
If this is the dynamic island does that mean the notch is the static peninsula
where is the USBC 
That intro though so worth it
mkbhd can you comment on how is watching YouTube without zooming fully on iPhone 14 pro
eres el mejor 
It would be incredibly unfortunate to own  4k monitor and not out this video on 4k so clean
I think that the dynamic island is a very smart way to use otherwise unusable screen space And I like the design But I wont buy any iPhone until it gets USB C Every single of my other devices have it and can be charged with a single charger and cable I dont want to buy separate cables and have them at work and in car just for the phone I also dont like Apples AOD implementation
Im not gonna lie the dynamic Island functions and animations looks great But not enough reason for me to upgrade from 13
ive been waiting
I could very well see the intro being n apple advertisement 
Help where buy this izone phone apples  ia m live in vietnam send me lick wher buy this apples
Intro
no privacy in always on display iphone should give ppl more customization options
Kudos 
Im waiting for iphone 15 
no touch id pass
Its still a notch but now its getting bigger
Congrats to the public yall paid for the phone twice 
these intros 
Intro never disappoints 
When all the budget goes to the intro and they just show a notepad screenshot for all the features of Dynamic island
Fingerprints on the selfi camera dont bother the quality Nobody is talking about it
Im switching from a Note 9 to a 14 Promax  so yeah a big update in my case also always been an Android user except for my iPad
nothing beats an MKBHD intro tho
630 I dont know many advantages of the apple  way I agree 
Is it just me but more than anything I was looking forward to see anouther fine banging intro 
"MKBHD battery usage be like No cell coverage 19

Hes been testing the satellite function"
308 love that you drop it on a pillow but add the sound
Then the regular IPhone 14s are a scam Same Internals as the previous generation
Its an improvementbut not to make us say WOWbut then those in apple eco system for them its a step forward
Sensor shift gone
Someone need to do a test with AOD turn on and AOD off to see the battery drain difference between the 2 phones
I really wanted that LGV10 back in the day Chances are so did most of us lol
That intro was sick 
The Dynamic Island BS is still so damn intrusive though especially during videos More Apple marketing garbahgio
An interesting fact that color difference you see in the notch where display area is highlighted differently in than the camera cut out the phenomenon causing it is called reflectance
Motorola also had foldable phones since the 2000s doesnt mean that the Galaxy Fold isnt innovative Huawei might have had the Island before but it only showed selfie taking tips while Apple does a whole lot so yeah its still innovative and unique
The sad part is that android users have been asking for interactive holes for a while but the most we had was a ring around the camera when using it but now that Apple has it they are all gonna implement it
the intro was too good
Good review jidion 
"320 I hope the microphone isnt turned on the whole time
But who knows"
Soo theres just a black bar at the top of every screen while youre using other apps The quick controls on the DI should only appear when youre on the home page Seems distracting Also with the size of the dynamic island they might as well have kept the notch Takes up about the same amount of space
"Great featureI dont like it
Touching the camera more often than before and it seems to be more intrusive than the notch for watching movies"
Ill say it again the Dynamic Island is a gimmick A software gimmick that was well implemented All that smudge The reach to the very top A great phone is more than fancy Animations And yes every one will copy it Its Apple Nice review Straight to the truth
Im coming from an iPhone 12 Pro Max Im ready for an upgrade Plus I ordered the pro Im over the huge pro max lol my hand hurts from just holding the phone
Hoboken Represent The iPhone 14 Pro its great etc etc What we really what to know is that a calendar Lock Screen widget
Hello I am Humayun from Uzbekistan The apple phones you are using are very beautiful and expensive I have to work for 1 year to get this phone because in our country this phone is sold at twice the price I would like to use this phone
So AGAIN Lightning slow incompatibility having to carry that one Special cable around with you So what about the EU court ruling of Apple having to change to USB C I see no movement from Apple doing this Talk about STUBBORN     
Ive been watching this man for years  just realized I am not subscribed I am sorry about that
As for crash detection my first thought was would a rollercoaster accidentally trigger it due to the speed possible twists  turns and the immediate stop
I dont like how the always on display just makes the screen dimmer All those pixels are still on so it uses a lot more battery than the always on screen for other phones that are just black and white
"Four years ago today my money wasnt good enough to purchase the new iPhone XS not this time Im proud of myself to finally own a higher end  iPhone 14 Pro Max Waited three years for particular this model 
Its a small win but Im happy and yes Im a Apple fanboy and always will be "
You probably WOULD get some benefits of sharpness with this new sensor if Apple would stop doing this terrible oversharpening For some years this had been a terrible trend at Apple I often prefer shots I took with my iPhone 11 compared to my 13 Pro simply because you always get ugly artifacts visual effects thanks to this extreme oversharpening in post
"Couple of points
Apples OS is a little bit confusing and not configurable enough for me
When you set the aspect ratio in photos to widescreen when you go back it defaults to 43 aspect ratio and do you have to reset it back its bloody annoying Android stays in what aspect ratio you set it at  at least on my Samsung and Xiaomi Mi 10
Also when you shoot a 108 megapixel shot and double tap to zoom in The image quality is outstanding Nothing comes close to the image quality when shot in this mode admittedly you dont shoot in this mode often because they are nearly 20MB file size  but outstanding none the less "
I think they should do 4k 120
Let us see the black its so mesmerizing
Gonna be getting one solely because of work need to get an iPhone to figure out how tf they work just started working in retail for a Telco and its hard as shit troubleshooting on an iPhone would be a nice upgrade from a 4 year old oppo
Not Fun fact iPhone 14 Pro in india starts at 1699 USD
nothing changed lol still got the ugly notch and nothing innovative dont why would anyone upgrade this crap
I have an iphone 12 im thinking of upgrading but would it be worth to upgrade this year or just wait it out one more
Does the iPhone 14 have always on display or is it iOS 16
The iPhone 14 trash
The dynamic Island looks like the Samsung pop up notifications 
The Dynamic island would be cool if it wasnt hiding a prehistoric notch Its a very crappy solution in my opinion The notch shouldnt be visible and the dynamic island movable Then it would be great
Xiaomi had it already
Just skipped an ad and got another one within a second wtf
"Review was the most boring video from your channel 
All thanks to the old new phone"
Pretty much every feature we see from iphone has been copied Yet we wont see that in a title would we And yes I loved having this Dynamic Island on LG V10 years ago except that didnt eat into the screen making full screen videos distracting This one will All in all this is a welcome feature but I wish Apple would let users have the choice of turning it onoff Especially coz for ppl with smaller hands this might be entirely useless Constantly reaching out to top of the iphone pro max screen isnt fun and goes against Apples own Reachability But asking for customizationuser control would be expecting too much from Apple I guess
Hey Marques how did you get that dotted calendar on your lockscreen can i apply it to my iphone 11
ive been using iphone 14 pro for almost a year nowmind blowing
You need to end that Lantern Fly
"He mentioning LG 
Me Nostalgic 

Kudos to him for giving credits where credit is due"
They should have a new phone every three years 14 times is not exciting at all
Why dont you just put it screen facing down when you dont want the always on display
So no rollercoaster  rides with this phone or else the crash detection feature will be triggered  noted
I upgraded to 13pm from my xsmax when i saw that cut out I prefer notch more than any kind of cut out big or small But when i saw what apple did with the dynamic island i kinda think that maybe its not as bad as i think But regardless type c is not coming to the 14 so i dont think im losing much here Gonna wait for another 34 year for the next upgrade
Samsung is the future
Potentially dumb question about the Island but is no one concerned about fingerprints being all over the selfie camera
1120 did he say AirPods twice
All hail the king MKBHD
"Welp people are talking about the dynamic island Which is basically a widget While samsung and china competitors are innovating with folding phones 
A decade ago I really admire apple now is just a joke tbh Steve Jobs is really the core of Apple"
The Dynamic thing looks more like a sausage than a pill to me
I wish apple would up their game on the camera versatility I know you said its versatile but ultrawide wide and 3x feels kinda lacking Im interested in switching to iPhone from my s22 ultra but I gotta say I absolutely LOVE having the same wide ultrawide and 3x plus a 10x This to me is what would elevate the iphones camera versatility even further Sure with higher megapixels you could just crop the photo and be alright in most cases but anyone whos used proper optical zooms knows how nice this is
YesI watched LG V10 review in between
I hope 14 pro max can take decently moon shots like s22 ultra
the way he just dropped it
Can I get that battery percent visible all the time in 13 pro If so how
What about burnin when using the always on display Seems like thats going to be an issue
This notch is a distraction more than ever  They dont call it island for nothing floating in the midst of the screen Its sorta halfbaked innovation Its fate will end up just like the touchbar if they dont do more
Dont be hurry Mkbhd Apple needs content for 2023 Sep event They will launch 8K video feature with 30fps
I feel is still distracting the pill or the hole on videos and games I prefer the Sony style
I have a 200 phone i was waiting for the iphone 14 pro but there isnt a big difference with last years iphone so idk if ill get it or wait for the iphone 15 
Apple is the most arrogant and shameless company
I spy a hasselblad x2D
I hate Apple BUT man the Dynamic Island is brilliant
Well I just wait until IPhone with full display and durable
Do you have the link of the wallpaper that you are using in this video please
that black looks so good
The insane aspect is really how this iPhone 14 makes my over 3year old S10 look so futuristic with its minor bezel and single hole punch camera I just ordered a new otter box defender case and screen protectors because I have apparently bought peak tech with this phone I could only loose ports and options upgrading today
Go on a rollercoaster and see if it switches on
"1807 bro exposed to his friend that he has 14 pro  Dynamic island
 Apple marques did broke the rules"
Why does everyone think Dynamic Island sounds cheesy Sounds fine to me
"Intro is sick 
Funny how Apple copied HUAWEI P40  Mate 40 pill shaped notch and named it Dynamic Island like nothing 
1143 Battery 69  noice    "
Nobody wants a notch dynamic or not
This dynamic island is just gimmick to fool 
In the Caribbean ALL our Islands are Dynamic calypso reggae dancehall parang salsa etc etc
Where is the battery details
"Thanks for mentioning LG came up with Dynamic Island concept 7 years ago with the LG V10
LG took many gambles and had some really cool stuff on their high end phones Sure some things were a miss but when they hit they hit hard

Theyre already missed"
"I will name my son  the human child 
Rest of you will envy me"
Love the review As for the new hoodie please consider adding sizes for tall people I have long arms
The way Marques dropped that phone was so smooth 
Its the same
Watching this on my LG V10
Garbage 
The 14 is an incremental upgrade again nothing worth caring about the 14 pro is an actual new phone with a real incentive to buy it
Huawei already did this whole Dynamic Island UI element with their punchhole camera in 2018 A few days ago Android devs also launched this software thing for Xiaomi All in all expect manufacturers and developers to copy and bring this thing to the masses hence its a huge win for Android users too
Its dark knight purple 
Lol its always fun for a French like me that 95 of the songs you use are French 
Fact correction you can purchase this phone in the US and travel internationally and activate the ESIM from another providercountry and you can also activate ESIM for an international number from the US as long as it has international roaming activated The telecom providers from other countries have defined workflows to do this and it takes not more than 2 mins and they have been doing this for a few years now
Xiaomi is definitely gonna copy
I dont know dude dynamic island is a pretty bad ass name Its also pretty hilarious that all the competitors and android fans have been hating on the notch for years now  now they will be coping our notch 
That must be copied
Maybe iphone soon will upgrade solar charging haha by mobile itself
MKBHD X Bear Grills is the crossover that we need Bear tries to keep Markus alive long enough for him to test out the new iPhone in survival situations
Apple had emoji bar in their mac books that didnt go quite well For me the island thingy is similar
Im going to upgrade to the 14 Pro because my 11 Pro Max only has 64gb of space
I was hoping Apple would keep the same camera design but keep it flushed with the rest of the body like the cool renders I saw from earlier in the year which would further separate the design between the 13 series and 14 Pro line
this was like the avengersENDGAME for video editors and vfx guys Theyve put it all
Im concerned a snowboard crash could get recognized as a car crash Fits the parameters of a car crash you mentioned except a slower speed
Dynamic islan will not be copied Its kind of dumb and a step back tbh
I agree that the dynamic island is such a damn terrible name Like literally who the hell came up with tht naming idea
Somebody call for an ambulance Apple just KILLED the competition 
Lets be honest here  that notch is not suppose to be in 1000 phone Anything between viewer and the screen  is a design flaw Steve Jobs wouldnt ever approved that
the intro was shoot on the iphone  always insane quality for the intro but it seems a bit grainy and a bit blocky on the edges 
"why so much dynamic island in your video 
Just a minor feature brolearn from mrwhosethebossfocus on important areas"
I love Samsungs phones and TVs laptops tablets etc I own a Z Fold3 and its been my favorite phone possibly ever because with it I dont need a dedicated tablet or PC for real web browsing anymore but I wish the UI was as smooth and fluid as an iPhone My iPhone 13 Pro Max isnt faster than the Fold3 but it feels so polished and sleek that you think it is I can get closer with dev options and tweaks but its just not there and it may never be but I can hope
the phone is nice but THE HODDIE IS BACKKKKKKKK
Absolute top quality review 
"Is this worth upgrading from my 11 Pro Max

Edit oh wow he answered my question "
I absolutely hate that people say ppl will copy apple while they also copied many stuff from other companies
What if you drive really fast then throw the iphone out the window I guess that would detect a crash Can you test this
This is iPhone 13S Pro 
Honestly looks like Apple are just out of ideas Removing the SIM card tray the sattelite bullshit Man at this point theyre making it worse For the first time Im thinking Im gonna stick to my current IPhone instead of buying a new one Thats very bad Also mark my words theyre gonna release some idiotic accessory to make phisical simcards usable on new IPhones again Its just how theyre planning their marketing now remove something essential then sell it as a separte piece for a 100 Its absolutely the same IPhone 13 PRO but much worse These new screens  its another dumb thing there tryina sell us  NO BO DY would see the difference A regular user utilizes thir phone to do ony so many things call people use it for social networks make unprofessional photos and perhaps play some games Thats it Everyones reacting as if these changes are  WHOA SO NEW AND REFRESHING No You wont feel any difference 2 words  Stupid and Bullshit
This is Copied
Jerry Rig Everything is capable of testing crash detection 
I SEE THOSE RINGLIGHT ON THE PROBE LENS LOL
Dont understand none of this iPhone shenanigans
Already was Xiaomi
insane intro
USBC a rant for another day  I suppose that rant can happen everyday until the iPhone 16 appears in 2024 Thats the moment when the EU will make Apple switch from Lightning to USBC They wouldnt make 2 iPhone versions Lightning and USBC would they
God i swear if it want for the simple fact that my iPhone 11 Pro had an accident I would never be getting the 14 pro yes cameras are great  Great software but I am so damn bored with the look of the iPhone 
God damn this phone is awesome
Marques you guys should open a advertisement company
Im just tuning out to MKBHDs videos and honestly I thought hes a Apple fanboy but it looks like hes not HMMMM SUBSCRIBING
"The no SIM card is a really dumb decision imo A lot of people from other countries tend to visit the US and take the opportunity to buy a new iPhone as its much cheaper than back home

Now this will no longer be an option for them and they will have to pay the 3500 price back in their countries"
Dynamic Island  is also a fingerprint magnet for front camera 
so no go for me thank you
i dont understand that apple always make a new phone evry year thats olmost the same i know there are changes but  the changes are always so small
It will be copied but not by any OEM with any significant marketshare The Chinese OEMs will copy it  because thats kinda their thing
I wonder if Apple banned him from saying Android for this review Theyre petty like that
About battery It could be iOS 16 Many people complain about battery live Im one of them as well
Your wallpaper link please
What an amazing intro Great content as usual
"Im using iPhone 11 Pro from last 3 years and I find no major feature which makes me feel like  wow I need to upgrade to a new iPhone  

That 0000005 faster cpu or gpu anything is not really mean anything for me to be honest plus no grand change in model to stand out deferent"
The dog is super cute More dog footage please
This is another disappointment from Apple
Is there video where he doesnt suck off Apple
Can someone share any resource regarding the Lgv10 feature
"1555 not to be that guy but cropping in on the middle 12MP of a larger sensor is not essentially like an optical zoom its literally like a digital zoom I get what you meant tho its like an optical zoom on the old 12MP sensor Though to be persnickety the 12MP portion of the new sensor is smaller than the entire 12MP old sensor so still not quite

There now im that guy but I did get to use persnickety in a sentence so worth it "
I still wont buy it without the sim card
Apple failing at innovation it seems and showing a promising future as an advertisement company
Indicator sign not seen at times
If they copy stuff from 5 years ago and call it innovation they deserved to be copied
Xaomi already copied the notch thing w the pop up
Yyyeeesss That intro did not disappoint 
im honestly not impressed with iPhone 14 series either uhhh another year of sticking with my iPhone 12 it is
Yes someone created a MIUI theme with this feature
Talk about a gimmick Apple shinning up a turd and calling to the dynamic island 
Im glad this video dropped today  I thought I was going to have to wait two more days
Can Samsung users customize their hole punch to become a dynamic mole
an only when charging option would be nice for the always on display
There is only one problem with this dynamic island which people may face oily fingers can smudge the glass above the camera which may lead to bad camera quality but we will know that only after we test it out
The dynamic island is not a feature Its an ugly notch that they added some utility to I dont understand why people think thats cool
Nice opening I took the unreleased iPhone 14 Pro everywhere but no one noticed it since it looks identical to the 13 Pro Not sure if thats a praise or criticism for Apple I dont care much for the outer appearance though since most people will put a case on it irrespective of whether Apple makes any design changes or not So its kind of waste of time and money making small alterations to the outside when you already have a proven design that everyone is already comfortable with and accustomed to
the iphone 14 is a scam lmao
"Iphone 15
Dynamic archipelago Hear me out"
Type c port is big thing in iphone after 7 yeas
No fast charging  
Dont worry if we see an iphone in your hand we wouldnt think its the new iphone its probably iphone 64 pro plus max or sth
Hey Marques I would like you check out the Moto Edge 30 Ultra It has a 200MP CAMERA
DO you know if APPLE will offer the UNLOCKEDINTERNATIONAL model with a sim tray in the USA  The UNLOCKEDINTERNATIONAL model is only sold by APPLE
Wheres the earpiece
I live in an island Madeira island which is known for its Levadas which is basically trails in the mountains alongside water courses with some places where theres no connectivity and where people eventually get lost some even die and so I can see that satellite feature come in very handy so they can call for help and be rescued
Wait when you take a screenshot do you still see the dynamic island
Many will copy the island but will it be that good though is the question
Intro graphics are touuuuughhhh
I just wish Apple brings a power brick into iPhone 14 Thats all
The original thing has been left out This system is not good It would have been better to have a SIM card 
4 hours sot is quite bad
You had me at Hello Dynamic Island I cant wait to get the iPhone Pro Max Love the hoodie too
Bro the introooooooooooo
You just chucked that phone away 
These intros are consuming me
Presentation is best for this ad n for iPhone n for flat earthers
Im not an iPhone fan but the dynamic island is cool and I actually like the name lol
I cant believe the pass on Magic Pill wow
I do not like the always on display It will use battery even though it is very little draw but if there is a way to lower the brightness then maybe I would like it
"Theres cognitive dissonance about the supposed improvement over the notch with Dynamic Island This is a shrewd copout by Apple

So now we have this capsule like blob further down the screen making it far more intrusive than the notch But we are supposed to believe its an improvement because it appears to stretch in a novel way with supposed functionality that offers features that could be done in far better ways Yet at no point does the intrusive blob go away and is always imposing itself further down the screen more than the notch ever has 

You can see my point clearly in the side by side display of the iPhone 14 and 14 Pro If nobody knew most would assume the old notch as the supposed improvement as it sits less intrusive closer to the edge of screen This is one of Apples more obvious deceptions ever 

And as for the Dynamic Island Well perhaps next time Apple will consult design technicians who possess something above a kindergarten mentality 

I had fully intended to purchase the 14 pro Hopefully something more effective and subtle will come with iPhone 15 Pro Needless to say I wont be upgrading"
Im only jumping from my 12 Pro Max cause my battery is reaching 80 health and where I live swapping it would be a hassle so I may as welI 120Hz screen and the AOD are my biggest things Dynamic Island is a whatever bonus
What is that dots on your log screen
Kanye west graduation 
It will go away just like their 3D Touch bs
Samsung just released the Fold 4 and flip 4 and this guy did a quick two in one Video For the Iphone 14 which is the same exact thing as the 13 there is a full feature video
Man the intro i am just so addicted to it the way the dynamic island capsule got transposed to letter I in iPhone and the same curvature was maintained for all the letters and similarly when the word PRO came  Marques is killing it day by day the smooth transition the 180 degree rotating shot the macroclose up shot of the camera island  marques dude u are killing it  hats off  bow down 
That intro shilling hard for Iphone 14 Ill pass wait for 15
Thats so crazy at 1240 my wordle guess was the EXACT same the day it was alpha I know thats not the most unlikely thing to happen but I still think its cool
Fold 4 still the best phone of the year
Pricing stayed the same for CanadaUS and China everywhere else you can expect 1030 across all apple products so now base iphone 14 starts at 999 eur and 14 pro base starts at 1250 eur now with the price increase idk if i want to upgrade anymore lol
Samsung S10 
I actually didnt know the space between the camera and sensors is pixels Does it ever get filled with content other than showing a dot for cameramic use
Where can I find the wallpaper in the intro
starting wasnt so supper
And what about things copied by Apple
"Thank you for showing and telling the real true reviews of the iphone 
That this is just copy of other competitive companies that Cupertino super nerds copy from  Nothing nerds  created by them self  I do have to say  did improve on quicker time changes  If it were regular time improvement then this copy improvements will take  another 2 to 3 years later  It should be called icopy 14  
I hope U will do put new and improved Samsung Fold 5 at July or August  We will wait on your ture review"
I did like that creative thought behind Dynamic Island but since it is placed too down from top of the phone it will be a distraction while watching the videos
WIFI 6e
"When Apple removed the headphone jack it did for all iPhones region regardless Removing sim tray for US only is stupid 
I have always imported my iPhone from the US because of high price in Africa but it looks like I cant sadly do that anymore Im not alone in this"
cant wait to pick up my 14 pro max purple this FRIDAY
i think tim paid for editing lamao
Yes lets smudge the glass on selfie cam all day and then take a selfie Such a good idea 
"that intro music hits 

nostaligia"
It is interesting well sad really that my 8 year old Android phone can still transfer data over 10 times faster via USB than the latest iPhone
Loved the V10 reference RIP LG phones
Ive preordered mine and it should be here on Friday Im upgrading from a busted Galaxy S7 Edge soo Im super excited 
1812  holy watch tan
it would be super interesting if the island was at the bottom of the phone and the apps when closed would close into it in the bottom just a random thought
shit that intro
whats the name of the intro song its by 20syl but which song
Did you get to test the new gimballike stabilization Apple was touting
845        1306        1322        Anyway youll use iPhone in the end
Man I was thinking of just going to an iPhone 13 Probut I want that space black and island not worth 100 difference but Im a terrible adult and like shiny new things 
Marques should I buy the 13 pro for 899 right now or spend the extra 100 and go for the 14 pro I have an iPhone 11 rn
Tech you tubers always complain about having to reach alllllllllll the way up to the top of theirs phones to have to mess with notification or anything else that pops up at the top of the phone  Now reaching to the top of the phone is cool
Me watching the video with 0 money
Damn that a useless AoD
wow i love the intro so nice
Does always on display with a static image not cause the amoled screen to burn and leave a shadow like in the case of existing amoled screens
No real information on battery life 
Does 13 pro max cases fit the 14 pro max 
ahahahhahahahahh
Jai Shree Mahakal Ji 
1305 a goosebump moment
Not worth it from 13 pro to 14 pro
Where did you got this wallpaper
615k views in a hour sheesh
Iphone is for dumb pplzwho doesnt know anything about technology
Te island is really thick hope they slim it down in the future But seems like a logical next step from the notch which they have kept for way too long
Ooooo  next level production 
always the one i go to for a review get up the good work
dynamic island is overrated
Why the hell does apple not have displays with the same if not better resolution than Samsungs I just dont get it  Im guessing maybe its some planned obsolescence bs Havent Samsung displays pretty much been the same for the last few years now while apple keeps their incremental upgrades to the display The richest company in the world you should be building your own not relying on your competitors to build your main hardware of your main money maker like why
Yeah Ill be getting an iPhone 14 pro I care about battery life and Im currently on an iPhone SE second generation so Ive never had comparably great battery life so thats a big plus for me and the Cameras could use a bump
replayed that intro so many times SO MUCH attention to detail I love it
Intro was soo good
iphone users really are about to buy a new phone for a notification bar animation wow
310 That sounds like the kind of feature a cheap to mid Android phone would haveits there but unpolished
The quality of your videos are just on a whole new level You and your team are cracked af
Is it worth it to upgrade from my 11 pro to the 14 pro 
Lol the camera bump so thick that is so ugly need to use  thick casing for that
Its crazy how these phones are getting upgraded within a blink of an eye  now the 13 pro users dont own the latest anymore
Samsung is all about the megapixel numbers when it comes to cameras I wish they had spent their time refining their image processing
915 Calender reminder to catch Flossys iPhone 14 Pro Real Review Nice 
The back glass being separate I didnt know about
They missed calling it iLand
Amazing content as always Im personally looking forward to the new dynamic island  upgraded cameras coming from the 12 Pro Max It will be interesting to note the overall battery life with the alwayson display Id call it more of a nicetohave because theres that temptation around picking up your phone when its always on  showing new notifications Lastly I think Apple did a stellar job with the island and I completely agree that they should have switched out the press quick press for the popup long press for the full app
No sim try is not just bad for international travel If you break your phone and want to put your sim in a spare phone to still be able to make calls to set up a repair or just be able to still function in the modern world Well you cant its not good
This surely is the Biggest Biggest Biggest Biggest
Apple will do what apple does and there will always be people to buy itI mean Im an apple person Lool The second I saw this into I had to pause the video I love your content so much and the editors did an amazing job omg
Better intro than Apple itself
killing it with the intro again
would love to take the new iPhone on certain roller coasters and see if it detects them as a car crash
Response to accidentally calling emergency services I hope their false positives will be better Past version of the watch called 911 while I was drilling into brick with a hammer drill I had earplugs in so no idea how long the operator was on before I noticed
International ESIM is wasaaaay easier than traveling and having to buy and swap physical SIM card Lots of apps that can do this and switch on and off with a click
This is still of course a new phone for a new year
So does the Pro have a 120Hz display or not Literally the deciding factor between that and Pixel 6 Pro
1349 euros in europeIm in portugal for the pro and 1499 for the pro max sure makes it a different appeal compared to 999 or 1099 in the USjust saying
This is the one Im getting so its good to hear the reviews 
Im due to upgrade in a month so will be getting it as it is cheaper than sticking with my current phone Although I take your point of its a worthless upgrade on its own
I was an early adopter of the LG v10 The second screen removable battery stitching the front and back camera images made it highly appealing for me The design was great as well The battery life though was not Glad for the shout out to this underrated device
Imagine getting hyped over a 1000 case  software update Life must be great in the golden cage 3
So excited to get my own 14 Pro Upgrading from the Huawei P20 Pro iOS is going to be a different world
It might be a bug that is causing the always on to use more battery in ios 16
Thanks for the honest review
Am a the only one or is the camera looks really bad with that over HDR look almost like lightly fried also dynamic island looks like a something thats cool for a week and super annoying in the middle of the screen
I dont believe the display engine contributes much at all to the animations of the island The physics arent realtime its all predone
Lol so the notch feature is a feature copied by Apple and now will be the most copied feature 
honestly this is the first time im not impressed with new iphone
So basically everyone should pay over 1G for basically an IPhone 13 with only a software feature which is essentially free How much have Apple paid you for being a shill
Nice editing Keep it up Also ive been using the iphone 14 pro for a while and what i truely hate about it is the battery life it sometimes just gives my less juice even than the iphone 13 pro and the iphone 14 plus I hope people do look into this battery issue for the new pro model from apple
It is easy to fool and ship similar hardware over and over and over  Thats what apple do and the buyers are dumb and stupid 
They just stole this feature from the LG V10 Android already did it before So how it will be copied though
Its so Apple to overengineer Always On to the point thats not actually always on just for the sake of being different
Dont get me wrong but Ive never given a like to your videos I am compelled to give one to this video because of Kanyes Graduation being featured here and also for featuring LG V10
Just a gimmick for marketing thats all the dynamic island feature is  I havent seen any recognisable changes in the iphone series after 12
marques Dude what about the battery life compared to a 13 pro or pro max Im minding to switch from a s21ultra to a 14pro max to have a good camera but a better battery Can you help me
They guy indicates that he will make a review Then he just repeats every word we saw on the presentation made by apple Using their images and videos What kind of review is this
Ugmonk notebook
Bro the throwback music intro 
Dynamic Island has already been copied by developers at Xiaomi
Curious about the screen captures Think the noew software is going to adapt to the olde phones
There was no price increase because theyre expecting you to go pro 
Thanks you for your honest review good job 
LGs were so ahead of their time first the ultrawide camera which is now on basically every phone now the dynamic island after their top screen thingy
They should work more with telecom carriers worldwide to get a deal that you can use your phone abroad like home So you dont need to buy a new sim everytime you travel We have it here in Europe We use our phones almost all over the world almost with the same subscription  we have at home Data  Calls its wounderfull cheers
ESIM only was a dealbreaker Was so pumped up until that moment and it just killed my excitement Got a 13 Pro max instead The 14 Pro Max also got a smaller battery so the AOD is pointless
Love Your Videos MKBHD   Was Waiting For The Video  Great Video MKBHD 
I call it bullshit island 
Dear Apple fans good luck dealing with this floating notch for the next 5 or 6 years while other manufacturers move to an improved underdisplay front camera 
The LG V10 and V20 had a smaller secondary screen that provided quick access to specific apps music controls notifications etc  It did what the iPhone dynamic island does  I loved that feature  The LG V10 and V20 are my all time favorite android phones based on functionality and aesthetics  Too bad they had flaws related to hardware and now LG doesnt make phones anymore
"The idea of dynamic island came from Samsung Continuum ticker display and LG made the first second screen on V10s hole punch
Apple copied Samsung and LG "
Leaving this here so anytime somebody likes this Ill come back to see this intro
Cool video and production
845 The dynamic island baby 
Is it worth switching from 11 pro to 14 pro or should i wait another year 
Dynamic island  such an epic effort put to mask a screen defect
Yo  I used to live in Kearny
try testing crash detection with an RC car
IPhone is going to peak itself in the next 56 years They are already rolling out features that are not that necessary They soon will shift their flagship focus to a foldable
"Dynamic islandDI

There I think I kind of fixed it"
Why do you have a shark fin with a Tesla logo in the background
Apple really missed a big opportunity to show a pseudo notification LED in the black space between the cameras would be a nice addition when most of the current Android phones have removed it
Wallpaper looks classy 
Well Apple copies punch hole style so what the issue
it is already copied by Apple
So youve had it for 2 weeks
1139 shoutout to the battery going from 96 to 69 Nice
The eSIM is a big problem now
1323 yes absolutely lmao
The notch still makes watching videos suck
nice intro
Yay they brought in the percentage inside battery indicator thingy
What are those lockscreen widgets Marques is using
so at 347 NDA breach possibility occurred 
A Rollercoaster could trigger the crash detection maybe
show off no better place than tesla seat 
Batterylive
I dont like the island Forget the name it looks super bad in my opinion All of the features are ok like sure theyre all really good but its super unimportant and minor
The Dynamic Island features are seriously one of the coolest things weve seen in smart phones in some time I was intentionally going to skip over the 14 series but thats enough to get me on board
Too Soon Lol 
We already have pop up notifications which all the apps are all set up along with floating windows which is much better then the dumb island
Nothing about the speakers 
"Its clever 
They know they cant get rid of the notch so theyve incorporated their software around it"
"Im currently shooting videos on my YouTube channel with an iPhone 13 Pro Max I definitely appreciate the new camera improvements and features and for me it probably is a good upgrade to make event not necessary probably 

Thanks for the top notch review as usual"
Glad to see Im not the only brother that has an Apple Watch tan
Im so excited to pick up the iPhone 14 Pro Max in a couple days here in Australia The dynamic island will be so fun to use
Finally people gonna not be buying the US version ones
I always liked how smooth the iPhones switch cameras at 1558 unlike Samsungs iteration choppy and with noticeable differences in color science
Ok it might be time for some removable storage I always overload my iphones with data iphones for me are essentially a one time use camera once they fill up its not worth removing all the photos and videos
Im not a professional smartphone user but I like expensive phones is this phone a good pick for me
No one is copying that huge notch
I hope Samsung does not copy this into One UI One UI has been focused on moving the touch points towards the bottom of the screen where it should be Everyone is wowed by the Dynamic Island animations but I think its just a gimmick
I loathe dbrand
Lmao the dynamic Island is so dumb as a concept
The way he just dropped the iphone without lookingmy heart
Can you review moto edge 30 ultra
That comes with physical sim tray based on the signal icon above
Funny how Nokia had the always on display over 10 years ago and it was done so that it didnt affect much battery life It was handy to have the clock always on Later they changed the operating system and that feature was done so that the whole screen was on and it took way more battery life than the original one
I love the way you review the iPhone things that others dont 
Lack of a sim tray really sucks for international travel I dont do it that much but not having it seems like its going to be a real bummer
So basically my iPhone 12 with a few tiny upgrades that most people wont notice Im so done with Apple when my 12 dies lol
That was idiotic to say that lg invented something like dynamic island Thats different thing Dont say stupid things just because youre famous
I just realized that the pile shape notifications look so much like Samsungs brief notifications Only Apples implementation is much more dynamic
Not only 30 FPS but 4K 30 FPS
I JUST SAW IT ON LANDSCAPE MODE AND ITA DISGUSTING
"Personally I dont think dynamic island will be copied its not as great as people react on it lol So overreacting You smash your fingers on your front camera and if you have the pro Max I would even have difficulty getting my finger there Also its too big for me in the screen

I was also wondering how the crash detector would work You have heavy car crashed where the car can go into fire or there are smaller crashes Both can cause injury So I am like how is that actually going to work and also if your phone is still alive at that point"
I love the way he shoots and edits the video created a benchmark for rest of the content creators 
I pray the Dynamic Island doesnt become a thing on Android unless face unlock is included on the phone using the feature
I think removing the SIM tray is a security thing Theres a lot of scam involving removing an unlocked SIM card from iPhone into another phone and and trying to fool bank to send OTP to that brand new phone and trying to gain access to victims bank account
Copy cheyyatte allathe avarkk anthurium cheyyan pattum
I have my dream Face on my always on display on Samsung phone with cook beared cap and cool full neck outfit
Ugly but some how they make it useful
The ending is why I stay with iPhone  I am getting the new iPhone 14 Pro Max 256  my wife will get my now paid off iPhone 12 Pro Max 256 my daughter will get her iPhone X 256 thats been paid off  All will get the latest iOS 16 update the 10 a new battery for 79  Everyone gets a new iPhone experience for the cost of one new iPhone 
Lg v10 ahead of its times 
What Im worried about in terms of dinamic island is wont you constantly smear your camera lense if you tap on this all the time I already have greasy camera lenses sometimes that i need to wipe clean so
Im not sure how I feel about the dynamic island in some ways apple reminds me of Nintendo in the way they just do what they want often with people been surprised and maybe even some controversy
307 nice plug
I should be going to sleep butttt
"Ahhhhh the intro sound nostalgia 
I remember when you unboxed iphone x 5 years ago "
That dynamic island feature reminds me of LG V20 
"I have been to cover 60 countries with cell phones and already traveled and spent time in over 20 countries using my iPhone 10 plus max with TMobile instead of switching SIM cards like I used to
Already preordered IPhone 14 Pro Max paying in full
I will enjoy this phone but to be honest the camera is the lease of my interest

Dynamic Island maybe seem cheesy to some but I remember the crazy reaction to the name IPad when it was first announced and many jokes with people calling it a stupid name
With Apple it just works regardless"
So no improvement on the telephoto lens Still 3x optical zoom is the max
why you dont show how it play video on this screen
This video lends credit to the rumours that Apple makes it so reviewers cant actually critique anything of substance This is basically an extended overview
The cameras are huge 
I LOVED the LG V10 second screen Instantly thought of that when I saw the dynamic island
In next iPhone probably they are gonna remove the charging port
iPhone 15 Pro will offer 8K and a USB C
"1218
The most copied features in the smartphone world next 18 month
Probably no The end goal here is to achieve biggest screen to body ratio for obviously content consumption without interruption notch pill shaped droplet shape even they reduce the notch size on this generation Many other brands already have small front camera cutout dot shaped why would they make it bigger again Maybe itll be copied by one or two models but Im doubt itll be implemented widely"
009
you have no idea how much it upset me to hear that the v10 is 7 years old
can the auto car crash detection and always on display be turned off
Amazing video info and edit as usual
please dont copy this its ugly and irritating
So does the iPhone include a physical SIM slot if u r buying it from a country other than the US
254 Weird never has happened to me What does happen is that when I walk or run or go up a flight of stairs it auto adds it to my Excercise ring
Eu j tenho 25 anos e ainda no me sinto bem quando um smartphone  jogado no cho
Xiaomi got the dynamic Island already one week later 
nothing new as always
I feel like the dynamic island is so unnecessary I dont see myself having a lot of use cases for it although Im never going to buy iPhone in general I will say though that if someone has an iPhone 12 they should probably look to update to either 13 or 14 because iPhone 12s battery life is so bad and the thermal throttling is terrible so that will could sure be an upgrade to go with the 13 or 14
Just an apple fanboy video 
1105 You can connect airpods twice thats crazy
Had a pixel since 2016 Think Im finally making a move to iPhone Dynamic island seems chill
I miss LG already 
Im wondering how the esim is going to work in Ghana  then there is no need to get my Ghana card lol
Bon Iver 
Wait for the next iPhone to get Type C lol
That into chef kiss 
This was one of the boring review ever I watched
For everyone asking if there will be smudges all over the selfie camera your answer is at 1245
Pro or pro max
The new notch looks great in the pro max model but seems to be a bother or bumpy in 61 inch pro model I dont like that AOD implication I hate any colours in AOD including OnePluss one
IPhone 13 v2
Can you please share that wallpaper 
This may have been the most boring release of a phone Ive seen in a long time
22 battery fills the whole bar  Nice to know that I have full charge all day 
In my country iPhone 14 pro 1500 no thx this year
"Apple talked 23 minutes about the Iphone 14 Pro 7 minutes for the camera
Marques talked 22 minutes about the Iphone 14 Pro 6 minutes for the camera
Where is the missing minute for the camera Marques"
Good way to make sure your front camera always has smudges
Im currently using a Samsung S8 I have wanted to swith to apple for a while but now I dont know which one I should get Should I get the iphone 13 or 14 and if I go with the 14 does it have to be a pro so isnt just like the 13 I will keep it for at least 3 years
I wonder if the front facing camera will have to constantly be cleaned with this new dynamic islandnot that big a deal but still slightly annoying
"1057 heres everything the dynamic island does
Except the thing is the dynamic island doesnt DO anything Its just the animations on the pixels around the holes in the screen No shade to Marques I understand he is just telling us about the phone but that is what Apple wants everyone to think that the dynamic island is an actual thing that does unique operations But it is the screen which every single smart phone has that is doing it and it would be even better without the cutout as you would have more pixels to do the doing Of course pretty much all phones have some dead space up there so might as well use it But Im not going to buy in to the idea that Apple came up with something new and better"
"I cant wait for Google Pixel 7 Pro review and compare it with iPhone 14 Pro Which phone is it going to win in camera wise

Dont forget Xperia 1 IV"
"Im an android user who wanted from Apple to get rid of the notch to try their phone because it looks ugly to me Now Im seeing this on papervideo not sure how to react Its cool but this dynamic island make their hole punch looks bigger than other companies also it looks way more distracting when you watch videos I mean the ugly notch at least was above on the edge of the screen now its a little further down and the space that you have above its actually has no purpose Also touching all day your front camera and your faceID without leaving smudges and fingerprints I dont know manI know apple do not want  to risk past few years but they have so much money and dont want to make innovations any moreCant believe we are talking about notches high refresh rate and AOD in 2022 on such expensive device as something new Probably will wait for 15 for bigger changes and hopefully fingerprint scanner and type c 
ps The same price is only for US for all other markets apple have increased prices so if you want an iphone better go and buy 13 pro "
This is going to be a massively viewed video
I cant ask this enough how does the island behave on landscape mode Cuz it would be ass if it stays like that
How much did u get paid to write that title  
We knew LG was 1st in lot i mean a lot Gone and still being 1st Now thats something baby 
Arey chuke bro nooo mobile ever yet existing had 8k display not even 56k sooo what is the reason normal user can experience 8k unless he hasss 8k tv U asshole review mobiles but never told that noo mobile can support 8k content in its display U being rich can afford 8k tv or screen Most cant
I cant wait for them to spin USBC as a crazy improvement over last gen or something
G forces from car accidents are just crazy You can speed up to 7G with a fighter jet but you still wont be anywhere close to what car accident does as the acceleration is so crazy it can tear apart you internal organs so I doubt it will trigger automatic emergency calls
i wonder how obvious the pill is next to black oled i bet it will be very obvious outsidein right light and that would ruin the illusion
Imagine the 2000 not going on at night when youre laying in your bed
How many things iPhone copied Android
Honestly the hoodie looks neat
1600 Lantern fly Kill it
Wait which LG phone was the first with Dynamic Island again
I rather have a crush detection instead of a crash detection 
Same old  iPhone moves  We changed nothing to make feel iPhone 13 buyer feel out of date And make them buy new shit which is wrap around of old shit
Woah that intro
The old excuse for no usbc was not enough space well since no more SIM card they are running out of excuses
and the battery You didnt say anything
Dude I never knew ill ever hear that name again it was my first phone and my favorite one LG V10 Damm it felt so good just hearing it  yeah its not so cool now for everyone its so dam cool for me
Man the quality of your content should be taught in colleges
Not will be  its already copied
I am thinking how many times MKBHD gonna put that phone down
18 months  LG invented it Xiaomi had a similar feature to the left of the screen
"No I think the dynamic island is fine because right now if you long press a notification a preview pops up and if you tap it it opens whatever that notification is so its the same I think that works 
Great vid as always"
307 I know you didnt drop the iPhone 14 Pro on the ground just like that 
does it have pixel shifting for the AOD might develop screen burn issues in the future
I hate new notch putting multitasking are at the top of the phone is so stupid its hard to use onehanded apple doesnt think about good UX UI and navigation anymore
Will there be copies made supporting sim card
Honestly I think youre doing a better job than Apple with your iPhone introduction animations The intro was amazing
Was gonna get this as my first iPhone but in Ireland its 200 euro more than the 13 pro was and still no usbc
Im fine with the current Lightening Charging port I dont ever transfer data from my phone to my computer and the only usbc type port i would use would be for my sons Nintendo switch i think that there are exciting new updates and improvements  to upgrade to the new 14 pro models
the dynamic island spoils the whole concept of an uninterrupted clean looking display as it frequently expandsextends in size for different functions its also very distracting rather the i shaped cut out would have looked way betterclean  uniquealso wht about the continuous smudges on the true depth camera system its really gimmicky  not practical at all
"PRO reviews check
PRO video edits check
PRO Hoodie check"
1840 while i luv autofocus series n dont mind the cam being iphone please wear a mic or sum 4 that series it is hard 2 u sumtimes mkbhd
Ask for USB C again and well remove something else
Im fine with the current Lightening Charging port I dont ever transfer data from my phone to my computer and the only usbc type port i would use would be for my sons Nintendo switch i think that there are exciting new updates and improvements to upgrade to the new 14 pro models
It actually looks like an old Android device Embarrassing 
"3 new updates 
Apple new iphone 1299 pls"
"This Dynamic Island operation will smudge so much camera lens that one will make a habit of cleaning front cam lens everytime one unlocks phone

There will be many smudgy selfies in  storage"
Drop a like if you want MKBHT to test the crash and satellite feature because he sounds like he knows exactly what needs to be done in order to go about it safely and without getting into trouble
"A few notes on your review 
1 You mentioned that Apple did the dynamic island opposite way ie 1 tap for app open  long press for widget view but this is good ui when you multiple apps you click on other one and it switches
2 Id also disagree that with your view that the new iphone does not have any crazy hardware innovation because you are only talking about fast charging or battery size I think there is a lot of hardware innovation  The crash detection sensor  satellite connectivity hardware in this formfactor is indeed hardware innovation 
3 Fun idea to test crash detection  Go in a car with a sufficient high speed And at some predefined location throw the phone out of the window but the phone is caught in like a net  cushions so it isnt damaged a lot Have a friend at that location"
So most probably he has iPhone 15 when the whole world gets the iPhone 14
bro forgot battery life
That esim will let me keep my iPhone 13 cause I travel alot
I think this iphone form factor is at its peak and there is a major change in iphone 15 or 16 I have 12 pro and ill wait for them
Ive never owned an iPhone before and I am about to finally switch from Android to Apple Definitely gonna get this one Excited to finally try it out Thanks for the review
iPhone 13S Pro
I see u have good taste in music Graduation I see u
You already watched the Apple keynote now you are just for MKBHD video 
I wish new phones were exciting like they used to be I feel like phone tech has plateaued so hard and they just rerelease the same phone over and over I would like to see something novel even if it meant taking a hit in efficiency at this point I have an 11 and I see no reason to get a new one for the foreseeable future No excitement in this industry anymore
1114
Anyone have the link to the wallpaper
Wait you had it for a year
Hahaha skin sunburn with the holes of the apple watch strapnice one
The Dynamic Island reminds me of the touchbar on my Macbook Pro I was soooo excited for the touch bar like I am with the Island Ask me how often I use the touch bar now If you said 0 youre right
Dang so you got it early while I pre ordered the pro max and wont receive it till mid October lol
Lg v10 shoutout was noice
"Big Bold Prediction here  
iPhone 15 will have 8K video along with USB C 10 gbps may be 20gbps for pros
And will come with some Funny and memorable marketing lines from apple "
Watching video with a cutout on the screenthats the premium experiencereally ill take perfect square any dayand charger and wire earphone in the boxbecause its doesnt need chargingim afraid to lithium bat close to my earoh ill really need that 35 jack
Samsung will be introducing sinething very similar to the Dynamic Island soon count on it
The intro is  
Apple fell off
you said nothing new in this video
"As if apple doesnt copy right
They just copied always on display "
"Cant wait to receive my maxed out 14 pro max space black 1tb
Edit in Peter McKinnons video he showed they had a white box which I believe is a mistake The black box on my mums 13 pro max looks way cleaner than the box in his video"
1000  20 bump in price in almost all countries except the US
Thought the iphone 12 from to 13 was a waste of money well here comes the iphone 14 with a stupid dynamic island gimmick 
Apple way  OLED burn
Satellite connectivity can be used in third world countries where dictatorships block the internet during uprisings like when it happened here in iraq in 2019 in iran also Maybe now the Ukrainian people under the russian occupation can use it Remember elon musk sent starlink devices to Ukraine few months ago
Yep Xiaomi will definitely copy that I have a Xiaomi phone so just saying the truth and even tho it would be not as perfect as Apples I would say IPhone has done something unique again and it surprises me
Removes the fingerprint censor and brings in the Sontoniri Island with dynamic dark sea waters
Always on display on 14 pro will increase the screen on time 
Car crash detection is on the pixel series without a bunch of extra sensors so its not exactly a new thing
THANKS FOR THE V10 MENTION
Was literally looking for a video like this all last night  just to wake up to thus 
Cant wait for my iPhone 14 pro max  Its time to replace my IP12 pro max D
Disfruten en colombia  nunca lo tendremos
Ive been watching your videos since you were in that tiny room with ur desk The more I watch the more i realize how similar our musical taste is Love your vids love the evolution and i absolutely love the transparency and honesty Youre a beast
If no physical sim can you still do lines like with the 13 esimphysical sim
"cant copy it when the notcheshole punches are gone
which will be happen for the vast majority of phones in the very near future"
"I predicted the intro 2 weeks ago Yes How about that Studio team
Top comment on the video Big changes coming to the next iPhone on the waveform podcast clips channel"
Im going from an iPhone 7 to 14 pro So all of this is very useful
Its 100 degrees outside and you have a hoodie
The Dynamic island is simply Apples stubborn way of justifying taking so long to move on from its long held embarrassing notch They dont want to look late to the notchless game so this is what they came up with Its so unnecessary and as was stated is a concept borrowed from a previous LG phone that came out 10 years ago Gotta give them credit for trying though
The only thing that bothers me a lot with iOS 16 is the battery icon is always filled in regardless of the battery percentage I feel like now that youve gotten used to having to reading the battery percentage of how much its filled in it will take a while to get used to that
Its the animations I cant deny that they look amazing and buttery smooth
How did he got 14 already
iPhone 14 Pros new notch  This Will Be Copied  None other than The COPY CAT Xiaomi  will be the culprit
Honestly you at me at new hoodie
845 The Dynamic Island baby What a terrible name 
Samsung screen dynamic island was copied from LG and always on display is Samsung iPhone is boring  Remove the I Even jobs daughter mocked apple
Its 2022 and iPhones still have a huge ass notch lmao
Wtf is 5G
Lg was a pioneer in all the features what your seeing now Wide angle camera was introduced by lg dual screen with that extra screen on top Laser autofocus Buttons on back of the phone 1440p screen on a phone lg got it first Oled screen lg got it first again Multitasking with popup windows what your seeing on samsung was introduced by lg first Even camera features such as video recording with all the controls exposure etc was again introduced by lg man i miss lg i used to have lg optimus lg g1 lg g3 lg v10 lg v30 Such a shame it stopped producing mobile phones
The iphone 10 version 4 dynamic island had me thinking Why not a dynamic notch Why not a stronger magnet Why not round off the back so it feels better in the curvature of the hand
The Most FUN Video of Marques I have Ever Watched 
absolutely adore the hocus pocus songs in your videos for years hope 20syl and the others know you use them
I just  when he just dropped the iphone on the floor
The production quality has fallen  No slightly indepth dive into the battery stats
good video 
Super helpful video As a Iphone 13 pro max user Im going to skip this one Thanks for making my descision super easy
I can see binary fission on camera and now on this notch Soon those sensors and camera will divide cytokenisis
          
Who would buy such a hoodie  sry
eSim only is a huge con Useless for international travelers
Satellite connectivity might be useful in Raleigh on ATT service
Im bummed there is no superlike or two thumbs up option in YouTube for your LG V10 reference
These all features have been copied from Android They just gave a new name like they did innovate new things
Still wild you cant close all apps with 1 button
Maa ki ankh ye intro 
The price in EUR is ridiculous 3
No talk about the battery details 
Why are people so enamored by a floating notification bar Apple sure does know marketing
Ive been waiting for this review 
Dont care about the dynamic island I want a 14 mini
Even more useless than touch 3D and we know what happened to that Yes it will be copied because it already has been by modders Doesnt mean its good Making notch smaller only to enlarge it by software That is next level stupidity
Mhh fingerprints on the selfie cam Not sure I am a fan of that part
USB C GIVE ME WHAT I WANT GIVE IT TO ME
Animation at start of the video is really MKBHD PRO MAX LEVEL
Somebody needs to tell Marques to get a beard lineup
1734 next year  EU regulation demands it
Wow we forgot about LG V10 Its bad that LG didnt do it like this for its V30
If you were to use a black wallpaper would that decrease the amount of battery wasting
Pretty cool phone but I wont be touching another iPhone until they adopt USBC Its absolutely absurd that they are still using a port that has USB 20 speed
Apple events and iPhones are no longer exciting The last excitement was the announcement of iPhone XS I believe Jobs wouldve had this bitch way thinner or gone by now
"they dont want to be accused followed current androids phone front cameras
Apple  latest 48mp in 2022
Samsung  enter the chatroom
XiaoMi  enter the chatroom
even apples selfie cam kinda uhm too much exposing darker skin"
Why cant I archive text messages on these expensive iphones
Do a 2022 blind cam test Lets see who the King is
I dont know but my old Samsung galaxy s10 plus had similar noch  smaller but on the sidehmmmm
How many people are going to go on the bumper cars and end up calling emergency services
and you can only get that on pro kinda sad tho
Yeah but in the end this island is bigger than the notch
I hate the notch but I wanna try the Dynamic Island   
After being on Android exclusively since Froyo I am finally going to try an iPhone That said as cool as a lot of apple products are I am still annoyed that they refuse to do common sense things like switch to USBC or make magic mouse chargeable while you use it
At least for multitasking they arent making us call it a Dynamic Archipelago
Loved the video
Android fans calling the Dynamic Island a gimmick only because its from Apple 
1325 Why not show the Lg phone Now Ive gat to do extra work to see the old phone with same thing
In Italy the iphone pro cost 50 more than in US Starting price is almost 1400  The macbook pro in italy is cheaper than the starting iphone pro The iphone pro with 125gb is useless you take 2 videos and your memory is full I think for what they offer and the price in my state even if Im wealthy Im going to skip on this one Its the same of the year before with 15 higher price I dont understand why I have to give them premium price for nothing back this time it doesnt fit the price at all Iphone 13 pro starting price should be max 1100  with a memory capacity of at least 250gb I will continue using my old iphone pro 11
Im choosing to call the Dynamic Island the D I since I have a feeling its not going anywhere for at least the next few years of iPhones
where can i get these wallpapers
Yay we wanted to smudge our front camera thanks apple
 On and on and on and on
That looks so cool and how do you already have it 
Biggest innovation Always on Display
MK uses att they service is trash get TMobile
Not worthy replacement over my 12pro Moreover i am now making my mind to switch to android reason all that  port charger and now the sim slot policy is developing as annoying to me I think the day will ce when Apple will just send an  without an iphone Conclusion Enough is enough
"1324
LG be like FML"
They made a big thing out of something that 99 of people will never use or care about being able to use satellites 
Lol once again Apple put something on there newest phone thats been out for years the always on display and the brainwashed Apple users thinks its new     Apple is so good with this in their marketing that next year they are going to tell there customers the phone only comes with a new color and these idiots will all get in line and upgrade     Great Marketing Apple
I have to agree the island feature will be copied Its a way to get people to not cover the facial recognition and camera with tape By making it a widget style interface people will want to leave it uncovered enabling constant facial monitoring Apple once again leading the industry in elegantly tricking consumers into being monitored
People who fall for this should consider doing IQ test  This phone still has bigger cut out than phones that cost 200 dollars xD How can someone watch any video with this monstrosity of cut out
"This Dynamic Island is a great way to hide the notch really smart design 
But that always on display is really a big fail Instead of doing what everyone already likes on Android or at least offering customization they tried to be smarter and miss the target"
you said that you wont test the sos features But why not test it
The cameras are good but Im gonna leave photographers to review them
I feel like Im missing something about the eSim debate  I preordered an iPhone 14 pro and will be traveling to France next month  In researching what not having a physical Sim tray will mean for my trip I found several options for buying a local eSim for France that seem like great deals and easy to set up  Best of all unlike for my trips to the UK in 2017 and Japan in 2019 obtaining an eSim wont involve taking the time to pop into an actual store UK or finding the post office where I had my SIM card sent Japan because I can buy and set up the eSim from my phone wherever I have wifi  I mean I guess its likely true that not every country is going to have the same mobile offerings as France so needing an eSim might give you fewer options in some places but I assume this will change pretty quickly  So at least as far as I can tell the embrace of eSim technology seems like itll be great for travel rather than a problem
"Resolution  U wont notice
Thinner bezels  U wont notice
Its iPhone 13  U wont notice"
Do you think the fingers would smudge the selfie cam because of the Dynamic Island
you are new tom holland lmao
Was excited to finally upgrade from my iPhone 12 but its the same shit 
Great wallpaper bro
Intro is  Disarm FGVI AllttA and 20syl  3
At 1900  isnt the new cinematic mode about 4k 24 fps  not about the fps 
I know Im late but certainly not last 
MKBHD intros probably make the companies insecure about their ads
This will be my wife and I first iPhone Pro MaxsoIm excited been Samsung all my life and still be but Apple finally got all the feature I like and looking for
This will be copied Really You forgot about Blackberry most of the ui of Apple are copied The square button taskbar translucent look the background colour of calls and the icons design like Calendarcalculator music and so on  overrated apple and hype most of it is Copied  Run your research boss Almost everything COPIED the Blackberry by iPhone
Crazy pile 
So many blurry selfies from people tapping the dynamic island and leaving fingerprints
There are grey areas in tech I love Apple computers especially Macboooks and Mac Minis But Apple iPhones nargh nargh thanks
309 MKBHD the First person to do a drop test on a iphone 14
I probably wouldnt have admitted that you walked around with an unreleased iPhone Not only because it might piss Apple off but also because you might get mugged That phone could be very valuable
Apple fanboy Marques
The iphone XS Max also gets the ios 16 update
"Was the technology invented by LG 7 years ago with the LGV10s second screen
Yes yes it was 

We truly lost a great company in the smartphone space 
Glad to see LG will still be remembered for how daring it used to be"
 That intro is smooth 
"Your Intro for the iPhone 14 Pro
Was far better then apple themselves 
The way you used the Dynamic Island with the animations was a fab job "
"I dont understand people saying they keep innovatingaside from Satelite connection and car crash the probability is extremely low in western countries
If you already have a 13 Pro there is literally no reason to upgrade"
Hey Marquesm Im an Oneplus user 8T thinking about swichting to an Iphone for the frist time sinces the iPhone 4s I would love to see a video about the strength and weaknesses of end IOS system and a android system Which one is better for whom and what would I be missing in an iPhone Should I wait for the new Pixel insted of picking the iPhone should it be the 14 or 13 What are your thoughts
"Summary of the review

the feature is good but I dont care about it"
5 Hrs SOT Damm thats worse
is it also a leap from 12pro to 14pro
"Kind of surprised you missed cinematic mode was only hd before but now 4K Kind of a bigger deal than frame rate dont you think 

Gosh MKBHD  "
That LG plug is awesome
I wonder will my aftermarket case will be good protecting the phone  with the speaker being so high at the top
Can you also have a detailed vdeo of ios16 There is one but its a high level types
This the quality of a review video when you REALLY love your work
This will be copied What about a lot of stuff apple copied from android
After watching this 22min video he is basically telling us dont buy an iPhone 14 because there is nothing much of a difference from iPhone 11 12 13 but if you have a 1000 to spare go ahead and knock yourself out
Does constantly touching the dynamic island smudge the front facing camera
2500th comment lol
am i the only one who prefers an actual notification panel over the dynamic island i know the notch has more of a purpose now but you still need to interact with the top of the screen
1900 lmao
Does the dynamic island sit lower than the old notch It looks like it to me
No 4K 120 No Fingerprint Reader No USB C No astrophotography This was a very subpar upgrade
That Intro 3 Nailed it
Mkbhd is disappointed with the new iPhone 
Marques be warned  anything above 24FPS is environmentally toxic 
So apple getting a pass for battery performance with always on dispaly but Samsung gets shit on for years with battery life cause of always on display Also for years Mkbhd been asking for always on display on iPhone now that it has it He turns it off and said doesnt really use it Wtf
LG will be always there in some way or another
Marques hit us with that wallpaper
The Dbrand promotion was smooth af
That intro with the pinkpurple on the camera lenses then the transition to the front was amazing  nice work
I was waiting for the techtember pun
In layman terms dynamic island will be the biggest reason for an upgrade for most people am i right or right
1322 will give you goosebumps definitely
idk how you are looking at it in the US but to me in europe a phone for a thousand bucks and not being able to put a sim card in is ridiculous and sadly other companies copy whatever Apple does so im worried
Good afternoon where does this beautiful person get such amazing wallpapers
THAT INTRO  Marques your production value is so high that your product intros are starting to get better than apples ads themselves 
pixels have had car crash detection for a few years now nothing new just repackaged by apple and sold to the masses as a new tech
At 1031 you have the album art and the colormatching waveform while the WVFRM podcast plays nice 
This notch thing is the kind of stuff appke is known for
One concern I have with the pill yeah Im not using the name does interacting with it lead to smudging of the selfie camera affecting photos Thanks
"what about reachablity in bigger 14 por max for the dynamic island difficult for single 
hand use right"
The idland is nice but nothing special Many people are gonna be upset with it pretty soon The biggest issue is the fingerprint on the camera Its not making me wanna pay that price for that phone I own the 13 pro max btw
What happens when you get your fingerprints all over the selfie camera from touching the Dynamic Island
im currently on the 13 pro personally I think other than that new Dynamic island not really much of a difference tbh  one thing thats on my mind with that is that there will be a lot of fingerprints on the front facing camera because of that I wonder how much that would affect the everyday use of the front facing camera cause youd be having to wipe it down every time you wanna take a good selfie picture personally i plan on upgrading to the 15 next year tho happy with the 13 pro as its still a great phone
Great video I hope you killed that lantern fly
So should I keep my iPhone 12 
can someone tell me tips for astrophotography I have a 13 pro max
This is out of the subject But why does he looks orange on certain angle in in this video
Hi Marques do we still have these annoying halos when shooting in the evening with some lights in the foreground 
Dynamic bar would be a better name
I still got my 11 pro and only reason I was going to get this iPhone was bc of storage reasons but now they release the same phone as the 12 two years ago but without a physical SIM card tray smfh
Dynamic island seems cool But I was starting at the pill notch the entire review Im sure youd get used to it but It just looks bad to me
havent watched a iphone review in soo long
hey heads brother your iPhone 14 pro link is broken still shows iPhone 13 pro 
This man is singlehandedly keeping 30fps relevant P
so iPhone 14 pro deep purple or matte black
Could drifting make the phone think you were in a crash
Best phone for 1000 yes 1400 No
Satellite emergency messaging is North America only so useless for me
These tech companies are building the cage around the consumer and throwing away the key without people even realizing it Ill take an old flip phone with removable battery please and thank you
Marques you deserve all 161 million of your subscribers You and your team put out some of the BEST reviews on YouTube I admit Im an iPhone guy so Im going to love a lot of new iPhone 14 content anyway but the way you interact with the camera and the flow of your videos  its a treat to watch Keep up the good work
Wish always on came to other iPhones as well along with a complete black mode for always on
What is the all iPhone camera shot YouTube channel called
They take everything from Android After Steve Jobs the features declined
"Finally found the  dynamic island  
Thank you Marques for pin it on the map "
I miss live wallpaper on the Lock Screen
No need to copy it reminds me of android
That intro crazy
"The OG intro music
I remember it from iPhone X video"
This is the first thing apple has done in a long time that they havent copied from Android devices Its sad to see all the tech reviewers pondering to apple whenever they do something
I bet listening to the song Gandi Criminal  in that phone  will be dope 
He just Admitted He Broke the NDA
What are the dots on the lock screen widget kinda cool
You know whats the best way to do the island DONT HAVE A NOTCH OR PUNCHHOLE at all  my 3 year old oppo is superior in EVERY way screen wise just because it doesnt have a copium pill on the screen
The hole punch is not big enough lets make it bigger with notifications in a place not reachable with one hand 
Ill be waiting for the iPhone 15 not much of an upgrade over my 13 pro max
When you said accidental detection you reminded me of a accidental drop years ago I was on the phone at the time I had a Motorola StarTAC flip phone It was that long ago I was going to work just had parked the car in the Parcade and had to walk down a few flights of stairs Opened the door and went to put the phone in my pocket and dropped my phone it bounced all the way down the stairs to the bottom the thing survived with only damage to the top of the antenna Put an iPhone 14 in a good case and see what happens in a spiral concrete staircase when you toss it down
Can i get wallpaper  Please  thank
Still trying to figure out how he got that calendar widget on his Home Screen Unless it only let you in the new iPhone
damn the intro man
For always on display what about burn in 
Ill keep my iPhone 12 Pro max
Apple can you Please Please do something with Siri please
I race up with my phone in my pocket so I guess I better not wreck
Will it be smart enough so that Siri will stop saying youll need to unlock your iPhone while its connected to my cars bluetooth
can you turn off always on display
I wonder if a roller coaster or drop tower would trigger the crash detection
anyone noticed that it 600 pm and the battery is is almost dead 
Such a nice intro
The hoodie is as big of an update as the iPhone 14 
Hows the knee
At this point I think I will switch from 13 pro Max to 15 or even 16 pro model
I think people really need to stop looking to the iphones as an upgrade once a year phone Apple is doing slow and steady improvements so that every 5 or so years you can think about upgrading
Y the older phone having small notch does not have this feature
We never learn every year new selling point Dynamic Island Nodge a smalled Nodge 
This island will make sure all selfies are low contrast and blurry due to fingerprints 
"If you got iPhone 11 or later
Still sitting on iPhone 8 D"
Super smooth how you dropped the phone with the dbrand case without any regrets
What happens to the dynamic island when you use the reachability feature
I love iPhone 
"the fantastic thing is that i would both love and hate this feature
it would be so nice seeing whats going on but i would also like to see all my indicator icons i see on android
what i would love to see is some sort of indicator LED option in the always on display since thats a feature I definitely miss from older phones
btw if you miss the notif LED like i do and you use android use LED me know its fantastic"
when you come to cupertino but you already know whats the hype behind it
Check the x80 pro camera out
Samsung taking notes
I know Im probably in the minority but I miss the rounded edge iPhone design
Maybe this decision would force telecom companies to support eSIM as soon as possible
Who really needs 8k video 
Tom Cruise can use Apple products in the next MI movie
"So youre just not gonna talk about fingerprints on the front camera because of Dynamic island MKBHD be slacking

Edit  didnt show the notch cutting into videos either whats going on here"
I was thinking of changing my iPhone 11 Pro but seing this one made me wait another year mine is still working perfectly anyways
"Ive 12 Pro Max the upgrade for me is on point right now and why not Id say 14 Pro Max will hold for the next two years strong no doubt in that Nevertheless I think Apple lost the innovation instinct Its shame
IMO Were using the same icons 45 years straight New Lock Screen looking fresh but still not customizable as I would like it I hope Apple will come with the next iPhone strong with new design and complete UI overhaul"
The camera is not that much better than the Pixel 6 Pro In fact in some aspects the Pixel camera performed better So iPhones will be  also losing that throne soon if they dont come up with something more innovative next
I know its a knitpick but I REALLY do not like the shiny sides lol
Did the thermal screen dimming improve
The dynamic island seems  like a gimmick to me Just add better multitasking  instead of this nonsense no one asked for 
Thats why I waited instead of going to the 13 immediately now the upgrade from my 12 pro to the 14 pro will feel different
Marques listens to Jcole  best review ever just because of that PERIOD
The personality of the pill and way the pill moves is very google esk But I dont think it will be copied I think the ultimate goal is to have a screen with nothing on the display
Marquees and his editors do so much in one video and they make it so clean also the audio quality 
Meanwhile it costs 1400 in Greece
did I hear right did he say he shoots his whole channel on an iphone camera
Apple doesnt care anymore theyre brands who try to push the limit of what a smartphone can do and there is Apple taking one year to make a phone with the same design as the last 3 years and a widget
Cant wait for destination Dynamic Island 
The edits for this video are phenomenal
100 bet underdisplay cameras actually become Internal Display Cameras just like you said at the start
It already has been copied by an android developer  That being said  it still has a large hole in this display They should find a better solution than a hole in the display Either under display or perhaps a popup selfie camera
Mate Apple needs physics to create a technology  then implement it after five years  then give a grand term aur hum chutiya hai
Turning a visual blight into a selling point Bravo Apple
i reserve my judgement until the pixel 7 comes out
I am here for the intro  Its legendary
I guess their logic is that if they cant get rid of it then make it easy to forget about so you just dont notice it and all the functIonality really helps with that
I notice a bunch of android trolls roasting this phone but iPhone will always be better Android will always be trash
The intro was sick
"Most copied
Android already has superior versions with floating bubbles of timers  now playing and also has picture in picture
Sidebars and gestures for easier access
But despite this Android users will copy the inferior version due to apple status"
It looked cool but now I dont like it
Fun fact 95 plus of all  Communications are done by undersea fiber optic cables and nasa is the top helium consumer in the world  So no I dont think theres things like satellites
When u ve waited for so long to get a new phone and when the moment came  apple just hits u with price increase  220 more just bc they love ur money more than ur feelings  Am telling u even if there was a world war happening Apple wouldnt care
Is dynamic Island not just a decently designed widget stuck over an ugly notch You could have it on any phone including a notchless phone and have it optional andor moveable
Im curious how the car crash detection will work while on a rollercoaster
u didnt mention car crash is copied from pixel satellite connectivity copied from huawei cutout functionality inspired from samsung
Looking to upgrade from an iPhone 6s Preordered a 256gb 14 pro in Space Black like Marques was testing Definitely feel like Im in for a treat
i like this new videos and chapter intros

lg v10 yes yes forget this phone
I just wish iPhone had inbuilt call recording feature
Great video per usual  What about the baseball demo for the dynamic island that they showed in the keynote 
some places dont have esim here in frica in my country we dont even know what it is
As for the automatic detection for the car crash happens a lot for me with Vivo I ride a lot with my bike and roads around me arent exactly smooth so I keep getting that notification loads of times
Im sure Apple wont give me a reason to upgrade my 13 PM for a few years
238 Zack from JerryRigEverything
You talk too much
Can a 14 pro fit into a 13 pro case  The 14 looks slightly larger around the cameras
Great phones but as long as they dont fix the keyboards or allow 3rd party developers more freedom on the keyboard apps I am too impatient to use iphones Going to sell my iPhone 13 after just 5 months because it is driving me insane how inefficient typing is being used to swiftkey on Android the full real swiftkey not the reduced iOS version
I wonder if Apple has bigger plans for satellite connectivity in the future Thanks to reusable rockets and cheap satellites its inevitable that there will be affordable worldwide internet in remote locations and I bet Apple wants to be the first in this space pun intended
Battery  never being above 25 the entire review told me everything I needed to know
Im not gonna be too happy when Samsung decides to remove the sim also You know theyre next to follow suit smh  I personally feel like having a sim port is important as I do swap from Android and IPhone from time to time
the better gyro sensor may help gyro players in fps mobile games
You said dynamic island twice since you promised you will not name it again P
Sick intro mad graph animation and as always very informative review
He too started writing text in video like mrwhosethebose
You did like Apple Event Style
The battery downgrade alone is enough for me to skip this I am also downgrading to ios 15 as ios 16 is draining my battery even on standby time
Will the esim work with cricket
Always on display is Always OFF on my display It was off on Pixel phones that I had and its still off on Galaxy S22 Ultra Also it saves battery too 
HowdyDo you have a video explaining the technical terms and what impact they have on the iPhone like Bionic
He got me when he dropped the phone at 306 
Good callout on the dynamic island tap  long press  Hopefully that becomes or is configurable down the road
this is a minor upgrade like from 7 to 8
1010 intro
Whats the battery like on this phone I didnt see you talk much about that
Hey   when is the AirPods Pro 2 review coming up 
Instead of trying to get rid of the camera notch they embraced it
Ive been tempted lately to switch from WindowsAndroid to Apple but the lack of USBC on iPhone is holding me back Not making the switch until I can have one cable to rule them all like I currently do
So there is now 3 different charging cables for apple products
First pin 
Dynamic Island is how the AR interface will behave Merging it with the apple watch menu style
Same boring os and basically appl copying android 34 years late again lol
The Review that me want to use Iphone
Hmm use bicycle to test for car crash
dynamic island is nothing special
I know the 11 pro max is getting iOS 16 but do you think the jump from the 11 to the 14 is worth it
Marketing is everything Because it is horrible and not special but everybody talks about that While Marketing is more important thing Apple will be always copied
Disappointed with the cameras They said theres a lot of improvement compared to the 13s but it appears that there are none
"lest hope it doesnt get copiedthanks to apple most new phones are crippled in one of 3 ways
They have a notchpunchhole
No headphone jack
Both"
So the dynamic island is just an animated bezel
Always on display is like a decade old  literally
That into was awesome
"All this excitement for standard notifications What am I missing
And if its a copied feature of another phone they arent copying apple they are copying LG"

MKBHD whats your take on iPhone 14 Pros with 60 Hz refresh rate
Im here after Mrwhosetheboss Comparison video
Have been happily using my iPhone Xs Max for the past 4 years Battery is starting to go a little too quickly and I bought it with only 64GB So Its time to upgrade for me Ordered the 14 Pro with plenty of storage
The Bon IverBonnie Rait Intro remix made me happy
"I was looking forward to this review
iPhone 14 pro and pro Max are quite interesting phones"
You have been creating videos about iphones for a long time and cant you even have the slidest ideas of what they are doing seems like Indian tech reviews is much better for giving genuine reasons
What is going to happen to LATAM and the esim tho 
Usage of Dynamic Island would become a fingerprint magnet on and around the front cam 
I dont know if anyone else feels this way but honestly the influx of higher quality cameras and sets and color matching in tech channels and all around YouTube are because of MKBHD and his early impact on the tubes
today at work a box that had like 20 of these broke open
Thumbs up purely for the seagulls 
The dynamic island is most likely going to make most people have pretty blur selfie photos just due to the oil residue left onto of the selfie camera everytime a person interacts with the dynamic island
i can put 2 simCards in my Fold4 HeHeHe
The fact youre holding my phone that hasnt even shipped yet shows me how important i am to apple 
Should I upgrade to this from a 12 pro or wait till 15
I KNEW you shot that auto focus video on a better camera It really does look way better
Awesome review as usually kept it all the way real
Nice to the the camera zoomed in actually looks pretty damn nice now compared to the iPhone 13 which I have its a decent close up camera but past 50 feets its just not great but I prefer apple but Samsung definitely is winning the camera battle in the Great Phone War
EYE CANDY
I wonder what interesting bugs they will have in store for the iphone 14 pro when the iphone 15 comes out My iphone 13 is bugging out asking for face id will watching videos and screen recording whilst not activating it 
Maybe this is the reason why apple retained a notch for how many years so theyll standout once they released this innovative idea Hmm  I wonder what theyll do next
I doubt androids would copy as theyre forever shrinking their cutouts Theyd rather be underdisplay cameras than this as it doesnt being any specially added function to android
what a intro
A friend of mine her watch triggered a crash detection walking over a steep bridge and she still had the number of her ex set as the emergency contact 
Sheesh that first 30 seconds is UNREAL
Apples strategy be like Make negligible changes  Demand non negligible prices
maybe it will trigger on a rollercoaster
The intro music gave me a throwback feel of early Logan Paul daily vlog days
Android will surely copy that dynamic island
"Dyanamic Island is Ugly Period
Also is not one hand usage friendly"
I love it
"You do realise that we have been using the camera bubble in multiple ways for years right 
Check out the Samsung mods"
"Should test the display in the sun not under the shade lol 
Kinda proof that fancy edits dont make good reviews"
Our boy listens to J COLE 
To be fair about the dynamic island naming they cant call it the Notch either They for sure will need to build API SDKs tutorials to be used by developers to integrate with it Calling it the Notch API sounds unclear Every phone have a notch whats different with this Calling it  the Dynamic Island API is way more intuitive just reading it my first instinct is that its an API related to UI and interaction
Anyone knows where to get this cool wallpaper
I got a samsung ad on this video
love the sound of sea birds that refers to the iphone island  012  sound design  
I think what they can do with Dynamic Island and always on display is have an animation around the island when theres a notification a green light run around the island Green dot etc while the screen is all black as per what Marques prefer and any other phones with AOD Theres so many opportunities with the island
Ill say stick to the 13
Cam we get a link to the wallpaper I like it
Apple Keynote intros are inspired by MKBHD 
Does the iphone 14 and 14pro run different OS Because the dynamic island need different OS features to function which is different from iphone 14
yeah Im going to wait for the USB C Iphone These features arent significant enough to move the needle if your on a 12 or 13 pro max
if the iPhone 15 Pro has USB C then I will get that if not i will get iPhone 14 Pro next year on a discount
The old notch even though hideous would blend into the edge and be forgotten by most people But this new pill notch is located closer to the centre and I can already see how it could come in the way when watching videos or doing something full screen Can you imagine having a task bar  dock that will stay on the screen permanently Well this is just that Surprised no ones talking about it
Are you going to make a watch SE gen 2 review
I wonder if crash detection will be activated when someones on a roller coaster 
i have a S10 plus should i buy iphone 14 or just wait out another year and try working out s10plus with new battery 
Im in Europe so Im waiting for the usb c on the Iphone 15 so Im using the S22 ultra
Still using LG phone 
As an iPhone user I will say that the iPhone camera is GOOD until it is able to take a clean photo to the moon
Here i am again Watching a new iPhone review with a 3 year old phone and no money to buy a new one
This intro is really really DOPE 
"Iphone users are so blind
This phone and the ones before it are very normal there is nothing intersting about all of them"
Marques do you remember that this pro raw stuff was announced by Samsung earlier this year saying tot will use its new 200MP next year to capture pictures you can now use on bill boards
Maybe try throwing it hard rubgy style and check if it detect a crash
"YouTuber doing drop test 
iPhone Im sending the cops now
"
Im switching finally from IPhone 8 Plus to iPhone 14 pro Max Hope Im not going to be lost Big discrepancy
I hate big notch  Any memes on head with hair
Copying goes around Apple to Android and vice versaAndroid phones have more advanced features nowadays which iphone is getting slowly year by year  I think Dynamic island might be a feature to cover the notchi like the way apple covered it  also it attracts fingerprint everytime it will be used so you have to wipe the camera for selfiesApple  is trying to make sure iphone users never get punch hole  iphone users dont know the joy of watching full screenthe main copy that all Android phones has from iphone is boxy shapeif you believe something blindly you will not listen or observe the good in othersthat will be misusedyou are the consumer so check whether the money you spent is worthy enough
Its from Windows Phone Glance Screen 
I wonder what esim only iphones will do to the prepaid market Im not gonna pay full price for Verizon I might have to get the iphone 13 instead of the 14
Just in time for the ride to work lol
Test crash detection with bumper cars
What are the Lock Screen widgets
Theres 3 differencees between the iphone 13 and 14 the pricename and price
"Folks I will guarantee you guys one thing 
I know one thing for sure one thing for certain if other ANDRIOD OEMs copies this Dynamic Island Samsung wont"
As I expected you will get the space black 
This mans intros are smooth as fck Damn Great video as always Marques
"Apple What is the feature that all our users are asking for in our next phone
People USB C Please
Apple Nah what you want is a notification bar at the top"
What a gorgeous intro
Im wondering how the always on display on the iPhone 14 handles anti aliasing I guess the screen turns off if the phone is in your pocket but what happens in a scenario where someone just leaves the screen uncovered
Many people plan to buy iPhones from the US since they are much cheaper when compared to most other nations So now since they have only esim versions in the US I guess people in other countries who are planning to get a new iPhone 14 series from the US will stick to the previous versions because of the carrier issue in their own country along with the feasibility of having a physical SIM Any thoughts on this
I still hope that Apple could give us the option for the always on display to just be a black wallpaper I would much prefer a black screen with time widgets and notifications instead
If only Ricardo Montalban was alive He could have said Welcome to Dynamic Island
So is now a good time to buy a 13 pro
"Its weird that we are still talking about who copied whom
As consumers we should get the best for the price we can afford 
Peace"
"This will be copied Like sure most of the IOS customisation features are copied from Android in that case Might as well say always on display is copied too 
Hate how he Gaslights every apple product now"
Marques read my mind I knew I was buying 14 pro but when he stated all the facts about why some people might only because of the ISLAND thing But i gotta say that ESim thing feels like a pain as an international student myself who has to move in  out of America often
Im here because Im pissed at Marques for not squashing that spotted lantern fly There are wanted signs all over my town for spotted lantern flies with instructions on how to find their babies and kill them too
Thats the smartest way of dealing with the notch so far Im waiting for it to roll down to the regular iPhone lines
the dynamic island being created means apple has no intention of removing it in future devices I hate this
Im definitely upgrading from my 12 pro max
Even apple couldnt make such kind of awesome intro for new iPhone 
Whats the widget on 205 most left one is it a calendar
They knocked the 14 pro lineup out of the park IMO Is it worth upgrading to from a 12 pro max
iLand
Apple is too generous You buy a phone they give you an island How wonderful
Happens to stupidity in general because its popular shame
The older I get the less I care about the latest and greatest copy of last years phone
Great video Apple cant win So many people asked for an always on display I didnt care in fact I was slightly against it because I assumed the battery would take a hit and it does
So in 2022 48MP is now necessary All this time it was unnecessary What changed
Tbh this hoodie looks sick
Rather unimpressed with this update to the Pro lineup Apple is very Pro recycling
Man this makes me want to wait for the IPhone 15 once they switch the port to USBC And Add 8K Video and possibly introduce a better battery
Yeah all that is good But that lightning port is still a no go for me There is no reason they are still using that ancient technology
One thing that will be annoying about dynamic island is that the front facing camera will constantly be smudged by fingerprints through constant interaction
For dynamic islands ABSOLUTE STUPIDITY AND LACK OF INNOVATIONSAMSUNG IS KING
the intro again damn
2158 does that mean i dont have to replace the motherboard and components attached to it to replace a shattered back glass
Notches and the dynamic island wouldnt be needed at all if there was no selfie camera and tech focused on the face
We need those merch in Middle East bro
anyone knows whats the widget on the left at 141 
Damn MKBHD is the earliest to upload a review no
dynamic island is a permanent widget that works with different apps also it has animations
This phone isnt the biggest upgrade in the world just another refinement But considering I have an iPhone 8 Plus I think its honestly the perfect upgrade
Apple Orchard  would be a better name
Why would any Android phone copy a problem they dont have Notchless is the way to go
Coming soon in a phone 13rd of the price
The YouTube algorithm needs to stop simping to you and the rest of the 66 male tech reviewers Your tunnel vision commentary is the reason we have phones that are made for giants YOU are the reason Apple just put 65 more action items in the absolute hardest to reach place of the phone Unsubscribed
Not worth of copyingits annoying
dynamic island is not a big deal for other phones lol sure it made pill notch look good but whats the point of adding it to hole punch it will just coz more distraction and even in iphone this will not solve video playback issue tho underdisplay camera is real future not some shitty ui change lmao
That stainless steel frame though meh Would be so much nicer in aluminum
is it a safe prediction that iPhone 15 will have USBC and 8K then
Can we talk about the Tesla surfboard
I cant wait to order the pro at the end of the month 
Damn That intro an the paint effect 
In a world where we need more reachabilityApple creates a gimmicky feature where you have to touch the top of your phone all the time to use it while making your front lense dirty 
Dynamic Island is completely unnecessary on Android phones Its just a gimmick
Casually pullup the LG card love it 
Great Review Im an American living mostly in Italy Will be buying the 14 Pro Max end of this month in California almost 500 less than the Italian version Hoping that I can transfer my Italian SIM to the new iPhone If not Ill use the Apple Store 14 day return policy and pick up a used 13 Pro Max
Marques has gone full lunatic dropping iPhones without blinking
1430 is that supposed to look like youre sitting on a toilet xD
Watching from iPhone 8 
battery percentage showing finally 
Anyone else think the pill cutout on its ownwo dynamic island looks worse than the previous notch
1815  Hassleblad X2D 100C review is dropping soon 
 Just shake it very hard while playing car crash sounds  boom 
Google pixel had crash detaction first why isnt anyone talking about it
Fantasy island ffs
whats name of the song at 1940
Not to sound like an Apple fanboy but Apple has been beating the Android chips for years But still might as well get the 13 pro instead if they will run the same way
Touches on the Dynamic Island leave fingers smudges on the camera lenseas seen in the video
Wont the front camera get all finger prints
I think the dynamic island is a clever way to cover the cut out
smudges on the front facing camera due to dynamic island  is gonna be ignored
Apple might be late in the game of punch hole cameras but they are fashionably late
Definitely not a fan of the e Sim only in the USA The drawbacks seem to outway the benefits of the previous set up that being sim and e sim The only benefit I see is the one example apple used of people not being able to take the sim out of the iphone if you lose or have your phone stolen For example I wonder how much of a headache it will be if you break your iPhone and need your service transferred back to a sim or another e sim to use on another phone
This may be one of your coolest intros yet
those who are into iphones already have this in their wishlist apple are not worried about their customer base thats why they make minor changes and call it a new phone people like me who dont have much use of phones apart from basic day to day apps not even including taking pictures will not care about this
Im upgrading from the iPhone X and Im soooo excited
WHAT THE FUCK THAT INTRO SHEEEEEEESSSSHHHH
Me who has never used an iphone 
Dont understand the logic of the islandI want as few things interrupting the display as possible  Id be pissed if Samsung tried to implement something like this island at this point
"1323
Lets agree to the fact that LG did something legendary technically and not Apple"
I think this is a decent upgrade That being said not buying it I would love to but the ESIM  only is a deal breaker for me Also telling everyone that but Apple will Apple
Im tired of Android always copying iPhone Samsung will always be behind
Apple just cant part divorce the notch It seems the are too afraid of paying alimony But to who Got a pilledshape notch and somehow manages to make it almost an edgetoedge notch Kudos Ill pass yet again Meanwhile thanks for putting it out there that Apple didnt come up with that innovation
If apple does its late mover if android does Its copy 
OMG that intro is SIIIIICK
Dynamic Island is probably the most creative thing Apple has done in the iPhone No doubt that Samsung and other manufactures are probably going to adopt this feature on their other phones with the holepunch cutout
Is the battery percentage a new feature in iOS 16
cool
what is the dottet widget on the startscreen
Marques Ive been a fan of your content for soo long bro Is it possible to provide me with a phone doesnt have to be a highend expensive one
So you were saying android will copy Hahaha android notch is tiny theres no way they r going for large pill notch just for this useless feature
Do we already know how is reachability working with the Dynamic Island
Love Techtember 
What is that widget on the lockscreen
The apples marketing team is as good if not better than the product itself DYNAMIC ISLAND Really
"This is such a kind and generous review like anything Apple is always 

Internals 
no significant bump in processor
car crash and emergency SoS are nice sure but cant really be a selling point For most of your life hopefully they are going to be just a gimmick 
no usb c why is it a rant for another day it should be a rant for everyday actually 
esim How exactly it helps any consumer Water proof Isnt the phone already supposedly water proof It brings absolutely NOTHING to the table and rather is a HUGE negative Say bye bye to switching between two networks in 10 seconds One will probably need to do this way more often than car crash and SoS feature again hopefully
colors deep purple wishful green who cares Most if not all are going to slap a case 

 Display
brightness kudos Thats it 
AoD apple way My arse There is nothing special about it You turn off your phone and NEVER EVER care about how nicely it transitioned to AoD Not to mention that AoD brightness is more distracting and he and others may rightfully opt to keep it off But even then no idea why the tap on the back for apple way They should be criticised for being late to the game as always
dynamic island really Its just not the name The whole concept is second class compared to what android already has in the notification panel LG V10V20 were far far more useful and practical than this stolen garbage implementation Will it be useful in daily life yes Is this a wow factor over android absolutely not

Cameras
Are they good yes Are they best in some situations yes Are they absolutely best NO 

May be I should start making videos and call out the reviewers to please call out the negatives of Apple way Likesupport this comment if you think I should"
hey whats the music used in the transitions
I hate this  iphone design now i m switching to samsung 
Apple makes good quality hardware The software is very basic to me Can even put your app icons where you want them lol
I wish apple makes the dynamic island can split the screen where you have two apps working like Samsung phones I have iPhone 14 pro Max and happy with it thanks mate
When Mate 40 pro was released people criticized the long punch hole When it came to iPhone 14 pro when thinks its a great thing
"Angola 
God bless you "
Cinematic mode ALWAYS supported 30fps this year they added 24fps 
Still better to actually have a screen and a small punchhole rather than that pillshit People who dont agree are brainwashed isheeps
I knew some of your last videos on instagram were shot with it P
After hyping Apple you leave the truth and spicy part for last
That dynamic island is really a nice touch to the new iPhone Cant wait to get mine on Friday 
I dont think anybody would open and fix his own iPhone 14 Pro
"You made a great point that iOS 16 will feel like a big enough of an upgrade on newer models
Really brought a breath of fresh air to my 11 However I am still going to upgrade to the 14 Pro this year since I really do miss OLED
And as always awesome video keep it up"
Between the iPhone 14 pro and pro max which one is better Thoughts anyone 
are day losson free
I wish they would improve the LiDAR Its been the same array since the iPad Pro and iPhone 12
The transition is same in Pixel 6 from lock screen to always on display
Are they sending AirPods Pro 2nd Gen review units If so mind making a review 
Once again Dynamic Island is shit whats the purpose of top line of pixels added above cameras None Then why bother
Loved to see the sponsorship of iFixit Repairability is still not prominent enough in todays consumer decisions
You always find the best wallpapers Got a link
Mkbhd finally doin 2160p res
The intro looks low res or maybe because of YT Not looking nice 
159 Born Sinner Track  Cole World 
As much as pumped I am with this review freakishlyyyyy loved the LG reference 
I will probably only trigger if you are connected to Apple CarPlay then it will be in OnStar mode as I call it lol 
1303 Will touching and putting fingerprints on the selfie camera mess with picture quality
If you have a 2x button Why is the telephoto still a 3x lens I would prefer a 4x or 5x telephoto
Now that you mentioned you been using it publicly before the release next year a lot people gonna be eyeing the device you use prior to the September event I hope you dont slip up and get caught with the NDA drama
Okay you need to test the crash detection and satellite  message we count on you MKBHD
GuysIve been using th Iphone X since it came out Im not into photography and its served me well Do u think its worth upgrading to th 13s or 14s  I mean the X  is still a great phone
Marques answered my question Not upgrading from 12 pro max
Hopefully theres an update soon that will make the AOD dimmer or more customization
Lol nice someone in a previous video called the island turning into the I for iPhone
844 The way he says The Dynamic Island baby
The Oled Burn in using the AOD will be ridiculous
That intro man 
I am using iphone since 4 But this one is Pure garbage
I dont particularly see the dynamic island will be copied on the android camp simply because most android companies have invested too much into under display front facing cameras and at least the big ones of Samsung Xiaomi Oppo Oneplus by extension and Huawei will simply keep on that trajectory which in the rule of cool of all these flagship phones beats the dynamic island by a mile
Love from BD
Man that island looks ugly af
soooo how is the battery life with always on did i miss something
Apple gonna mess around and have there own cell service Esim only More like apple only 
LG mah man
Marques is definitely a huge kanye fan
"Both Samsung and apple copy each other Apple isnt any better than Sammy at playing the market Sammy isnt any better than apple in this regard either Both hand held are juggernauts that are copied I see tons of things ios pulled from Android and tons of things android pulled from apple I will personally never own own another iPhone I dont like apple charging me more for less because the refuse to adopt industry standard IE The lighting cable I dont like how hostile apple is to their users and how the are fighting against the right to repair You all remember the digitizer issue the iphone six had It wasnt fastened down properly You call apple support and they want to charge you a huge amount of money for their hardware flaw I have had issues with Sammy phones but Samsung has never given me a problem They have always put my needs as a customer first and foremost Apple hasnt doesnt and wont 

Here is a list of my favorite apple fopas they dumped in their customer  base

1 Bendgate iPhone 6 plus bend easily from customers and there was a serious issue with the digitizer staying in place Did apple take responsibility Nope it was the customers fault

2 ipod nano cracked Phil Schiller blamed it on obese Americans putting the nano in their front pocket in tight pants Again apple refused to take responsibility for their problem

3 Apple refused to support adobe flash It was considered anti competitive by having apple not allowing a competitor to run on their hardware

I could write more but I wont I wanted to give a few of many examples as to why I loathe apple"
APPLE IPHONE SO EXPENSIVE I HAVE NO MONEY BUT ITS OK FOR I HAVE VIVO Y11 I LOVE IT SO AFFORDABLE 6500 PESOS ONLY LOVE LOVE
I have rn an iPhone 8 Plus
"I LITERALLY HOPE NOBODY INTENTIONALLY TESTS that crash detection

Also the eSIM ONLY thing IS AN ACTIVATION ERROR AWAY FROM ANGERING MANY iPhone users 

I have previously stated that I had an ACTIVATION ISSUE with my iPhone 6S or iPhone 7 and had to get a new SIM card from my carrier"
Definitely upgrading A lot of people still use older models of the iPhone including me so this is a good time to upgrade to the 13 pro max or 14 pro max Only problem on the 14 is the esim
Are the internal reflections better than on the iPhone 12
"OH MY GOD THAT INTRO IS AWESOMEEEEEE
Man I always love watching MKBHD videos
The cinematography as well as audio is awesome and the information is always delivered well and can be trusted
I love this channel man"
dynamic island is a great new thing it really shows that they work well with even the smallest things
252 Yes all the time But tbh its when Im walking out side so I just say yes and then stop the workout when I get where Im going
Which widget is there on your Lock Screen 1st from left
I was thinking a rollercoaster MIGHT trigger the crash detection
Not sure when recording in 8k would ever be needed or wanted in my life
2 kth comment
Uhm you just admitted to breaking the NDA 
God I hope everyone doesnt start ditching sim slots now  especially damsung
Yay
My question about the eSIM is there is an option to buy an unconnected iPhone form the Apple store Do these iPhones have a SIM slot Or are all iPhone 14s sold in the USA with a carrier plan or not dont have a SIM slot
Still a piece of shit device looks just like the last 3 models
They could have named the chip A15 pro for all the iphone 14 models and nobody would notice
wallpaper link that in your phone
"Call it the pill and make Apple not amused about it
Think differently people"
Just got an iPhone 12 for work The camera is so bad compared to my Samsung S20FE
"Amazing features great intro
I just got the iPhone 13 Pro max at a discounted price cost me same as the 14 plus "
"I dedicate this video to LG V10 software engineers 7 years ago They did the right thing 
Paradoxically booing stupid executives "
Apples marketing team is truly brilliant when it comes to disguising flaws into features The pill is functionally way worse than a narrow notch as now theres a narrow sliver of pixels between the pill and the bezel which isnt the best when it comes to consuming content Of course the pill is also way more in the line of sight but Apple has done what they do best and made it a feature as they did with the headphone jack
Always on display is so bad on iphone lol
1850 Cinematic mode always supported 30fps in fact it only supported 30fps The new change is that it supports 24fps and 4k resolution at all frame rates
That intro Always showing why you all are the absolute gold standard So well done
damn boy waited for this good review 
Can someone tell me does a new airpods pro has upgraded features for a partially deaf people 1 generation could do it in some way but only with a help of the phone
Didnt cinematic mode start with 30 fps
"Using 11 pro max right now and I dont think Ill be upgrading to the 14 pro max Will be holding on til they release a bit differentupdated hardware  software Had high hopes for the 14 seeing the rumorsmock ups but it has been a bit of disappointment at least for me Nothing from these new updates seem to make sense except for the camera But I still think I can hold on to my 11 pro max until the iPhone 15 series hopefully lol

 PS iOS 16 was a banger tho "
And still no sub6mm 5G outside the US
I feel like you people are ruining the smartphone market
Pour a drink for LG the OG of phone innovation
After upgrade to ios16 battery in my ip13m is worse I dont want to buy new phone
I liek da hoodie
Apne removes physical sim card  one step closer to portless iPhone
You said battery life is slightly worse than the iphone 13 pro How much is slightlyin hoursminutes of screen on time
so does the front speaker not exist anymore
Can you share the wallpaper
Not possible to schedule always on display Like between 9to5
Apple shoot themselves in the foot by removing the SIM The iPhone 14 may have its own genie inside but for me a phone without a SIM is good as a phone without a battery
1452 Check Maquess left hand Dont use Apple watch all day
Very good video and cudos on fitting all this info into a video thats not an hour Long
That 48mp shot was the difference I was looking for compared to the 12mp weve been using
The intro made think I was watching an apple commercial
So nice watching something that you will never get
This will be copied as just apple Copied everything from Android Wow So they finally did some innovation since Steve Jobs passed away
bro has played stumble guys
Nah i dont think android Mostly Samsung to copy it One UI is always about one handed usability Dynamic Island is the opposite of that Also Anxroid already got apps notification indicator on the top left side of the screen Which Apple lacks
Tempered glass screen protector manufacturers gonna have a massive head scratch on how theyll gonna produce their products for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max 
Thank you very much for review 
dynamic island who so hows the experience when watching full screen mode    constantly touching the front camera leads to cleaning when capturing a picture usin it get your reviews complete and not just the goodside
"You cant get the dynamic island outta your mouth
I think you should copyright it 
Make it your own Marques "
Wallpaper anyone
Marques drops a phone Im dying to get
what if you drop your phone will it trigger the crash detector
Damn I miss LG phones 
The strangest thing is why no big YouTubers do a video on the PWM issues OLED screens have 10 of people get effected by the technology giving them headaches migraines etc and some more serious than others I wish Marques can do a video highlighting this issue I personally am sensitive to it and I can not buy any phones with OLED screen My current iphone is the 11 and it seems it will stay that way until some big YouTuber shines some light into this issue Please Marques if you see this look into it
Do you have any videos on making the switch from Android to Apple and vice versa Im a long time Android user and wondering what I would miss if I switched to Apple
Song
Now I gotta see the video for lg
Seeing the behind the scenes of how you shoot all of the shots for your tech makes the scenes even better
How sad it is that the best thing Apple can come up with in 2022 is just a notifications bar 
Excellent review I loved the intro and transitions therein Kudos One thing I observed in iOS 16 is the battery anxiety with battery percentage displaywho knew a minor thing can influence experience so much Not for me  reverting to not knowing the numbers
What copied means to yall 
"We all know soon enough that the dynamic island will be on other devices 
Great job definitely getting this pro model"
Dynamic island already existed before in other phones
BUT does the 14 Pro fit on the MagSafe Duo charger 
The pill also indicate the Beats speaker shape
Apple doing what they do best copying yawn
"This is not reviwe 
This first impression videooo"
For the crash detection you pretty much gotta slam the brakes and get your phone to fall on the floor and that sets it off At least thats how it is on Pixel phones
I can even say that the apple widgets on the Home Screen look like the live tiles from windows  phone which were automatically flipping and did not have rounded corners  Apple is taking ingredients from everyone using their own design language to make their product attractive and elegant  I think that is why other companies are failing they are only focused on usefulness and forgetting beauty and aesthetics  Yes  all cars have the same useful capabilities but not all satisfy your senses the same way thats why there are luxury cars vs Utility cars  I was not an Apple fan but I respect that they thrive for quality looks usability beauty consistently throughout the spectrum of products they offer since the beginning  Its hard to do and not every company can do that  Microsoft for example is notorious for abandoning consumer projects they divested so many consumer based software products before transforming themselves to be also a hardware company which was not the case in the beginning  I give Apple credit for staying who they are  I cannot say the same for others even Samsung
I know that Marques used the same intro music in his iPhone X impressions video
They already copied Always on Displayits not about copying but learning from each other and making their products better
"Dynamic Island is attractive
good idea"
Island boi
Copied by who That dynamic island is shit Androids are trying to go all screen
Yesterday some chinese dev made an app similar to Dynamic island  for ANY android phone  supports Bluetooth connexion and charging as of now but pretty sure the flexibility of android would make it support anything basically   thats why i can never leave android no matter what apple does ios can never be my daily driver because of the all the restrictions  Apple is a fashion brand at this point
That Intro
Apple is done
I still got the regular iPhone 12 had it for two years Im looking into upgrading and I wanted to upgrade to the 14 pro max or should I upgrade to the 13 pro max Still undecided 
The Notch is now a FEATURE
Android AOD is way better than iPhone
the pill shape is so big ill for next year maybe itll be smaller
Dynamic island may be marketing gimmick But where is the true multitasking  DEX like feature Pen for notes Customization on lock screen is too bad Clock widget is fixed section under it is fixed too it block face of people in lockscreen wallpaper Useless upgrade Hope Samsung S22 gets cheaper
Would you have dropped the phone like that if it was yours
Thats not Aod for sure
 i so hoped youd use an Island wallpaper alongwith the seagulls sound effect
Im on the market looking for smartphones with the very best cameras this 14 pro has me super tempted to switch to Apple but I wonder if Ill care that much about the lack of USBC Its speed is great in a clutch but I havent transfered data wiredly for years
In the next edition Im sure iPhone 15 will get dynamic island as well Also Im not buying it unless they get USB type C I use Macbook M1 Its doing great I love apple hardware especially the battery life of apple silicone However for phones I prefer android but I need iPhone to test the apps I develop on a real hardware Im just waiting for typeC
Man pretty sure the girls from the fall movie wouldve loved this lmao
I disagreetap to open app and long press to open widget is the right way kinda similar to android
Dynamic Island should be call Dynamic Bar
Yep knew thered be some Tesla sightings in here  My ears were tingling
I thought were going for full screen no notch or punch hole cell phone Now Apple has this big black bar and people are celebratingIts basically a Touch Bar on an iPhone which the MacBook discontinued
I guess Ill get the 13pro then
Im glad you have the Chevron Sweatshirt on your shop I will be purchasing this for my birthday
I am considering the iPhone 14 just because of the dynamic island 
Have you tried if you go to bumper cars if crash detection works I know it might be a little bit of stretch from a real life scenario but yeah
"Classic 
Clear concept 
100 better than pervious one
Entertaining"
I preordered the Purple Pro Cant wait I have a question I saw a video where a guy was saying that the iPhone 12 has problems with leaking information I was going to keep the phone because my brother sometimes looses his phones and I didnt want get him a new one He could just have this one or I would sell it Is there any truth to this
Where can I get the beautiful wallpaper
1814 do a review on the X2D 100c  iPhone camera even with 48MP I wouldnt consider it 12 just alright for daily use
You the best bro
iPhone upgrades are a joke now ehh People dont know what iPhone they have anymore because they are all so similar
1144 nice
"Couple points
1 on these new pro phones I wonder how many times will user need to clean FRONT CAMERA due to dynamic island
2 always on display is really bogus its just plain battery drainer
3 removing physical Sim apples walled garden just got more difficult to get out from

As always apple finds more ways to sell new iphones with no real upgrades"
As inventive as I think the dynamic island is and its great I cant help but prefer no dead pixels on my screen So Im glad it works for lots of others but its not for me
"Why does every YouTuber just show us the dynamic island example with just the 2 same apps 
The musics app  watch app
Can we get more examples of different apps smh"
Theyll just move to MagSafe completely and get rid of the lightning port before they ever move to USBC
The intro tho 
Since the Dynamic Island is out now we know how they made space for the battery percentage
Ill buy a new iPhone next year cause I feel were being spoon fed tech 
TIL I have the same wordle starter word as Marques Nice
I think the USBc iphone might just be the supercycle iphone where most people upgrade till usb c imma probably hard pass 
Most powerful iPhone ever
MKBHD So Ive been using the iPhone Pro for 14 months now
animation and the all the text flying is getting too much Simplicity more please imo
I wouldve bought on day 1 but not having a physical sim tray killed it I spend most of the year outside of the US in countries that mostly dont have esim yet
I actually canceled my 14 Pro Max preorder Sticking to my guns and waiting for the 15 Pro Max for USB C charging Im done with lightning Hopefully it also has wifi 6e support and 30 watt charging speeds as well
I have doubts about Android OEMs copying Dynamic island Android users have generally hated anything that takes up valuable space on the notification bar for no good reasons thats why the notch died on Android At its core Dynamic island is about adding useful information to the status bar on iPhone On Android theres already load of information up there
your reminder to floss ahhh love seeing it takes me back to your podcast about this
I can see it now All these android phones with holepunch camera cutouts now going a their version of Dynamic Island and then you basically have a notch again I really hope this stays an Apple thing
Samsung    we are in process
"I hated the idea of the iPhone switching to a cutout I still cant grasp the idea that so many people think a black whole in the screen is somehow better or less intrusive than a slightly bigger bezel at the top
But when I saw the announcement I was kinda giddy D its just so natural with the implementation and the wiggly animations that it doesnt feel like a whole Like you said it feels more like a software feature than a hardware Limitation"
on Always Display On is very bad when you go to sleep because there is always a little light in your room
What will be copied is foldable phones
The always on display is so fire
1000 then i go look at my countries stores 1400 1500 
We all waited for too long MB
As always writing a comment to support the channel
Its funny how so many Android fans here just deny thing after thing that Apple does Even when it gets praise Its like they cant accept the fact that sometimes Apple does it right
Wow havent heard this song since your 10m sub video
"Works straight out the box

Well I sure hope so "
2023 usb c
You man you 
Very bad review for marquess level
Compare it with mi 12S ultra Itll be fun 
If you want to test the accident detection probably best to leave it in a car and let it just drive into a building
Is that the same Mooncolour hoodie I can get on Amazon for 13 the price
Would have loved a little on how the new pill affects video watching
Man it would really feel good to test out Dynamic Island for myself It would awesome to see the notch animations
Dynamic island function is cool and useful But just looking at it it very obstructive and looks ugly because of the size
Amazing iPhone 14 pro and iPhone 14 
You have to be paid by apple
Scared me with that V10 zoom in
How do I get that iPhone wallpaper
Every year when a new iphone comes out im always tempted to buy it Ive never had one Maybe its time to switch from Samsung to Iphone
Hope your knee is feeling better
In india I phone 14 basic model starts 1000 dollars
Praying samsung copies the dynamic island cuz thats such a neat design
Dynamic island is a great example of turning a compromise into an incorporated design feature
Great content as always worth upgrading from 13 pro
The dynamic island feature would make your front cam very smudgy due to the touch interactions
I will be making the upgrade this year not for the DI lol but for the cameras
This will be copied on an iPhone video is ironic
The classic MKBHD intro brings tears to my eyes 
"I almost switched to iPhone last year when I had an upgrade but then I remembered
Lightning Fuck that standard"
QUALITY Thats mkbhd review
How good is the dynamic island while watching videosconsuming content in general
Coming from a note 10 plus should I wait for the s23 ultra or get this
Super saf mr whose the boss just posted to but Im watching yours first man really love the content
Android kinda has always had its own dynamic island with pulling the notifications bar down and having control over your media controls and even telling you how far your Uber is On Samsung phones you also have Onehanded Operation in the Goodlock app which allows you to summon widgets and Quick Toggles and Media Controls from anywhere on the screen
you mean Apple is copying from Android
"Great video once again

I do have one specific question about the Dynamic Island
Using your fingers all over it does create a lot of fingerprints which would later interfere with your Selfies and stuff
Im basically touching my camera nonstop and putting grease on it which does not seem like a good idea to me"
As a salesman for Verizon not looking forward to the eSIM only part eSIMs have been highly problematic in my experience
How is AOD in nitewill it be bright to disturb the sleep 
The hoodie is lit 
Brandons on the top of his intro game
Maybe next year is when there will be a design refresh thats when Ill be sold Until then Iphone 8 till it catches on fire
Pretty cool iphone  But i think this is the first time ill pass on a new iphone since the 6 I have the 13 pro max and will get another year out of it The new camera is the only thing i really care for The dynamic island literally does nothing for me aha i could care less for it Tbh the apple watch ultra and new airpods are what grabbed my attention 
How long does it take to get fully charged
what about the flash led lights
"Old iphone Who are you
New iphone Im you but expensive "
Android developers have already developed the dynamic Island application seems like Apple is the leader who refines already existing hardware and features and make them look cool
Is the purple the same as the xperia 1 III purple
Can anyone share the wallpaper link Thanks
Bro do a comparison vidoe between 14 pro max and xiaomi 12 s ultra plz
Please dont copy this either make the camera smaller or put them under the screen I dont want punch holes I dont want notches I dont wanna hide the issue Get rid of it or bring back the top of the phone
That answer the call button is way up and far from our thumb wth apple
Can apple use those led in the island thing to alert us when there is a notification
About time the pro line has purple But I am not upgrading
installing todoist 
Didnt Xioami already copy the dynamic island I am pretty sure I saw a clip of that somewhere a few hours ago
So that Island thingy is pretty much a fancy Widget or like At a Glance
1813 not the Nike watch band tan
If apple make that dynamic island on normal iphone 15 next year i gonna buy it right away without complaining Its the best gimmick for this year that no smartphone companies ever try to use that notch Yes i know samsung already do it but apple do it more better
I was so looking forward to this to see if I should get the Pro Thanks Marques 
I was thinking about LG v10 Thanks you mention it LG deserves that credit
Brother your expression is priceless when you checkmate 24fps 
I pissed my knickers
Looks like Ill be sticking with the s22 ultra
Question is the front camera going to be smudged because of the use of the dynamic island
Dynamic Island is the death of the selfie with fingerprint smudges galore 
A phone is a phone after a week its just a phone
Nailed the review  simpleclean and to the point 
Thanks LG
I hope Samsung doesnt do something like Dynamic Island because I dont wanna be cleaning my front camera all the time
Here we go Its finally here Been waiting for this
I really hope you tried to kill that lantern fly after you took its picture
i still have  a 11 pro max i think this gonna be a nice upgrade
Its actually very much nonApple to put the feature of eSIM only being among the first to do so which rarely happens in Apple World
The film  Fall  could have ended in just a 30 min with this  i phone 14 pro
Air pods pro 2 review next
Android for sure is going to copy this in software lol the Versatile Cyclops  for the hole punch
I like that Avengers Quantum jacket themed hoodie
Could you do a video that compares the Apple Watch the Galaxy Watch and the Pixel watch when it releases
Maybe a way to try the car crash feature put it on a robot arm accelerate it and then suddenly stop it Maybe it could trigger it 
Can we get that wallpaper tho
The purpose of the alwaysondisplay is you can see if you have any notifications on a glance instead of hitting the power button everytime you want to check them
They will bring back the sim card tray Or people will have to use 2 phones for travel
"Good sir 
The amount of videos being released right now is impressive You will break your record this year "
Next its going to detect if you previously had sex and text your wife
That spec on the TV behind you was making me think something was on my monitor haha
when u go to apple site and open dynamic island photo in new tab u will see dual pill hole design
Man These intro Just awesome
215 Im still waiting
Every year people review phones for their camera not the actual phoneyoure buying a phone not a DLSR camera Its like if the phone is great and feature rich it will get shit on cause of not so great camera performance
Nobody cares about the cameras bring new exciting features F alll that Bs
One question though Do you and Arun from Mrwhosetheboss synchronise your timings when uploading video Cuz this puts me in a dilema 
Dropping it down the stairs might accidentally activate crash detection My iPhone told me I left my iPad on the train when it was in my bag on my back
Smart phone manufacturers need to stop wasting worlds resources with these minor phones updates It is ridiculous at this point
The thing that anoys me is that even if the pill wasnt there they can still do the dynamic island thing its just a well executed software that makes the still humungous pill seems like a feature
Love to also know the widgets you got on the Lock Screen
My man sets a reminder to floss This guy is Hella organised
I just got the 13 pro like 2 months ago hey
Siri upgrade when 
"Look at this graph
I understood that reference"
You better have crushed that lantern fly
Im coming from the Pixel 6 Pro Its a decent phone beside the little bugs that it has but Im wanting to switch to iPhone because all of my friends have it and I dont feel like dealing with the hey download this app so I can also be in group chat Im wanting to get the USBC version of the iPhone and it is rumored that the 15 will get it Which Pro Max should I go for 13 or 14 If 13 where I found that they are basically a couple hundred bucks different
your hoodie looks like from Jiren of Dragon Ball Super
Intro was cleannnnnnnn
Really great information   biggest camera upgrade most powerful dynamic island cool
Its funny how years went by ANDROIDS is trying to get rid of the notch hahaha and apple did this dynamic island  SURE samsung and all of the android world will copy this WAHAHAHAHA 
Personally Im going to wait to upgrade until Apple makes their strategy regarding ads clearer If they start baking ads into their user experience then Ill probably jump ship to android I enjoy iPhones and tolerate their disadvantages because of 1 the lack of ads and 2 The software support But get rid of those and I will most likely switch to Android
I cant remember the first video MKBHD used that song intro for but I really fell in love with this song
This can now be callad an island 
Its a two app widget  What happens with a 3rd app  Lame
Really good mobile
man use wifi to transfer the videos and photos
How will the esim work for nomads that travel and work from countries in South America and South east Asia Is ESim wildly used already or is this still new for a lot of these telecommunications companys 
Pixels have had crash detection for a while now Now seemingly everyone wants to test it as if its some innovative new feature Just confused
frequent fingerprints on the front camera due to dynamic island
41 minutes 
"Addendum  This Has Copied And Will Be Copied
Thats just how cutthroat competition works "
The new crop in isnt even thst new Nokia did it almost 7 years ago on one of their phones but its not well known as the phone didnt sell much
I bet dynamic island will be completely removed within 2 years
That intro is fire  Looking forward the the studio explantion how it came to be 
Apple be hitting hard tho these days
Strap it to an RC and crash it 
The dynamic Island is pure garbage in a general sense But since Apple has vowed to never get rid of the notch design they decided they might as well make it functional which is way better than a big ass notch for iPhone users Understandable
"Two things

1 Can we turn off alwayson display I assume you can but you never know

2 How much does the dynamic island get in the way of videos that are NOT in full screen mode if that makes sense"
We will be seeing more smudgy selfie not long
sorry about your knee bro i see you got PT
Im super concerned with that AOD not shifting things on screen My OnePlus 9 Pro shifts the time around to not burn out pixels showing time at all hours of the day and the brief looks at it here dont indicate to me that it does it on the iPhone Miiiiight want to disable that unless you want OLED burn in 
am i the only one who noticed that marques is listening to j cole
Another coverup for notch I dont think anyone will use it its hard to reach the top with one hand use
I was waiting to upgrade but I dont think I will for another year  Its all personal reasons nothing substantial I was hoping they would change to a cport I plan to go abroad and need a phone with a sims card and I love the purple on the iphone 12 mini and I was hoping they would have it on the pro max the purple is too dark and dont know why they got rid of the rose gold I will keep my phone another year or so
Looks like they moved the laptop Touchbar team to Dynamic Island functions 
I think Apple hasnt innovated for a long time  have to admit as a android fan the island is a very good idea that has a purpose Android should definitely copy it 
Whats that app widget with all the dots
Honestly I was hoping to see more Android phones take on the flat edges and sharp corners of the iPhone because I love that design but that didnt really happen
What will be copied The dynamic island bs Lol nope Other phone manufacturers some have already accomplished this partially would actually much rather work towards getting rid of notches and punch hole camera cut outs while apple never ceases to slow down innovation
hi i have a iPhone 12 mini and first gen airpods but prety much evry time i put both airpods in my ears only one connects I think it is random witch one connects And when only one connects i have to put them both back in the case and then put them in my ears one by one Anyone got the same issue Marques Brownlee
That Dynamic Island thingy is an unknown life form that will betray the user one day and automatically install Raid Shadow Legends
I am curious as to will the AOD cause burn in issues in the OLED panel of that iPhone a few months down the line
Dont mind me just waiting for the next android feature update to introduce its own dynamic island 
As a fan of ALTTA20syl I find it interesting how you use clips of their music for pretty much all the intros for all these years
5G
No more going off the grid Appreciate the 411 Stay Blessed
I really think I have a crush on him
Sounds about right I am upgrading to this from a standard iPhone 11 But if I would have anything above that I mightve waited another year
as an android disciple I really respect apples implementation of new features even if they are fasionably late to the party The dynamic island looks fantastic and actually has nongimmicky functionality the name of it is silly but it is definitely as close to perfect as a feature can get
Feel tired actually when thinking this island will remain the same for about 5 years
Anyone else catch the iMessage bubbles in the middle of the ocean Hehe nice lil Easter egg
Cant wait for the new MacBook Pro M2 Max with the Dynamic Island and still no FaceID
so the phone really is listening to us since it can hear the loud car crash noise
With the carrier upgrade deals it better to trade in a 12 pro max for the 14 pro max as its basically free Why not upgrade
Did you floss 
Its like Im watching a premium video
Nice Wordle stats 
This intro is one of a kind 
the thing i like the most is the flat screen
What is the new price of 13 PRO in US market
the mid intro tracks are amazing
L bozo
"All the enthusiasts are freaking out over that intro

plus that intro song is giving vintage MKBHD feels"
Lol Apple themself copied this from huawei You are just promoting apple as you always do
Price
After every release iPhone Im waiting for your review video  Thanks 
The dbrand magsafe pass through is ass not sure why theyre a sponsor
Which wallpaper are you using in the video Looks cool  please share for 14 pro max
No thanks Ill stick with my 68 S22 ultra
Is that an Tesla kanoe in ur backround
LG act as the pioneer of many features that we see today its just they are not have a Funny name dynamic
i like how they made IOS 16 more one  hand friendly on the lock screen Moving notifications to the bottom But then make EVERYTHING go to the very top so its almost impossible to one hand it because of this dynamic Island However i like the implementation and idea
If you travel without a sim in most of the world you are f Why would anyone buy a phone without a physical so simcard
as a mobile developer  mkb its not that complicated 2 weeks is enough to develope the entire thing and they have teams of developers
Just call it a DI  I think everyone will know what you mean when you abbreviate it Thanks for the video Marques
Nice permanent wrist watch mark
Cinematic mode already supported 30fps sooo
I like how he just drops the new phone then keeps on talking as if nothing was there to begin with
Happily stick with my XS Max for another year or two since 2018 It still serves super well and smooth after changing the ageing battery
Already saw an Android phone hacked to have the Dynamic Island
luv from india ill get this
I SWEAR TO GOD Arun and Marques will completely dominate the YouTube tech market until the end of time
After car crash it be like now activating 911 distress call operater 911 dis da janitor 
I really hope its not copied especially by Samsung All those functionalities can be achieved in many other different ways including proper widgets without that awful pill shaped cutout thats very intrusive for content compsumtion Please Samsung dont bring it back please
Copied by some Chinese companies brands for sure But Samsung or Google the face of Android I dont think so  they are focusing on other things and mainly getting read of the hole punch
Me getting no signal in College Turns on satellite detection 
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP THE V10 STILL HAVE A DEADZONE ANDROID IS MOVING ON TO FULL SCREEN
The App Airalo lets you easily get eaims when you want to travel No affiliation
Marques casually dropping the iPhone 14 Pro and trying to hold in his laugh at 308 honestly had me rolling
Intros are always satisfying
That opening 
I started watching the video being interested on what they had to offer a few minutes later I was already scrolling youtube searching for something else to see and now I paused this to comment as I just figured out that I dont care I already know the apple way of doing things everything else will be told to me by every apple user in my entourage so Before I go tell you mothers you love them people
The irony that a video was just uploaded that showed miuis take on dynamic island called smart island in the grumpy ui 
12PM FOR THE WIN
Great content
I only like my islands Dynamic
Almost all people avoid touching camera lens to avoid finger print on in front of a lens  This feature makes it like it is okay to put finger prints on the front camera without knowing affecting the out comes of the photo quality   Whos gonna remember wiping those unintended finger prints every times they fudge around with the dynamic island
How practical is actual using the dynamic island I mean the animation sure but am I really gonna swipe my camera to multitask Most people cant reach there camera with 1 hand
Whats the use case here why would someone need surgical grade steel in phone
1325 Shout out to the LGV10 recall this phone from a while back come to think of they did indeed have a second display up top of their phone Good Catch Marques
Im a dynamic island boi
ishaped notch exclusive in iPhone 15 pro
Nice bro 
Does 3nm come in future 4nm doesnt burn the phone
so about that knee pt did you do it yet
"hi marques
im from iran and having iphone in iran is like a impossiable dream
so please give me a free 14 pro
thanks
love u"
"From a UIUX designers perspective this is a 5050 for one side having interface at the top a screen is a huge no no its your thumbs deadzone and the largest majority of people use one thumb to navigate their mobile phones

On the other side you have the theory of users that follow any trend because of their attachment to their brand in the case of Apple they are one of a few companies that can get away with this"
So something that could be just added in a software update for Iphone 13 gets new hardware named as Iphone 14
Dynamic island is just the renamed punch hole
No one will be copying thisApple just making something work with a old designAndriod phones is headed toward the future dont really see a need for any other flagship phone atleast to do this Wont work with just a punch hole either
Man that intro
"Intro is freakin sic
But articles letters over the screen looks a bit strange imho"
listening to the greatest j Cole album 200
I really hope iphone 14 pro should have released before  FALL2022 
MKBHD pls make full review on NOKIA X30 5G
Sick intro with the sick hoodie from a sick creator 
Bruh I hate that always on display I usually have my phone next to my bed facing up and even in my previous phone that had no OLED the amount of light coming from it was really annoying I now use the Pixel 6 which turns off all the pixels except for the clock and that is good no annoying lighting that I dont want This apple way would be a literal nightmare for me Almost like it always cries for attention which I am certain the effect will be once people use it You are just gonna look at your phone even more c
So should we crown the 14 Pro Max Rookie Of The Year
bro wallpaper link
Awful No upgrades
That gulls mewing when the dynamic island shows was spot on Another hq content from MKBHD 
Just found an easter egg in this Video Upcoming Autofocus review of NISSAN ARIYA  mkbhd
everybody makes fun and hates on Apple until their favorite company copies the saaaaaame shit
Hocus Pocus song 3
Still wouldnt buy this
Screen Ative time on iPhones are kinda alien to me
That intro was on fire 
First 40 minutes
I just want to know how much screen space is taken up by the Island when watching YouTube videos No one has shown this
As always a great intro Apple should hire you
nice  you are great brother Frome india
Tesla skateboard
Im wondering if others apple product will have this dynamic island feature like ipad or macbook Im consider to buying it
Dynamic Island or whatever I rather have the Face Unlock and the Notch than Googles decision to go backwards and remove face unlock and back to Fingerprint Thanks for Amazing Videos
Hot take I still hate the dynamic island and I think the fact that android phones will copy it will set us back a couple years from a truly notchless display
The selfie camera makes your skin tone grey Mr Brownlee
"Marques 2 questions 
 Didnt the Fold 4 come out before the 14 pro
 then where is my Fold 4 full review  

PS There is still a notch guys Buy lots of that 20 USD apple cleaning cloth for your front   "
I miss my lg v10
Pro tip Buy an unlocked new iphone 14 in Mexico with nano SIM
Dynamic Island is the better innovation of the Touch Bar on the previous generation MacBook Pro
This phone is amazing 
Nobody gets hyped up more for nonsense and more of the same than apple and iphone fans  
I have a 12 Pro and wont be upgrading until Apple releases an iPhone with USBC This Ill be getting my first Apple Watch instead
I got the 13 mini  is it worth upgrading 
Wait how huge is that notch thingy wtfffffff lol
Love it or hate it its still a clever software design to work around the limitations of the hardware
I knew he was going to have it before it came out
What wallpaper are you using
I dont think that apart from few a dynamic dot UI wouldnt be mainstream in Android world Though the notification is more interactive without the need of swiping down but still swiping bottom up left or right seems what many would prefer for multitasking
Are international iPhone 14 SIM cardless too Or will they have a slot
Will EU phones have both Esim and a sim try
Marques Brownlee new phone cool but Dark Sky is loosing support Thanks Apple Buy it and then mess it up
The amount of effort the MKBHD team put in these intros is just awesome
The satellite SOS feature is a great feature for countries like the UK Theres so many dead spots in the country side for cell service and there are a lot of road traffic accidents in those same areas Hopefully one of those things you never need to use but nice to have
Att gave me 1000 for my 12 Pro So it only cost 100 for my 14 pro A no brainer
Heyy its the hoodie in the profile picture 
the dynamic island is really a game changer instead of updrading to a new iphone some might not like that feature it seems to be annoying
Idk about that esim because Here in guyana I dont think our carriers gonna be supporting that for the next 2 to 4 years so the iPhone 14 pro or pro max wont be shipping to my country for now
Id take a phone thats continually refined as opposed to a phone that just throws something at you with each version thats super gimmicky and adds nothing to the overall experience Slow and steady wins the day
Crash Detection Im not gonna test that Im sure some other YouTubers are going to find a way to test that 
Is it quite heavy
Notch is a notch
Did he mention the dynamic island can connect AirPods 
Im now worried the market will focus less on getting rid of the notch because of Apples influence As a consumer this sucks
Excellent video Does that new pro model IPhone 14 get hot when your shooting video and taking pictures
I dont think this will be copied much as within 2 generations selfie cameras will be hidden in Android
I have the regular iPhone 13 and for Christmas Im going to get the purple iPhone 14 pro Max
Awesome 
Good review
"Lol
It wont be copied
Very bad year for crapple"
Not a fan of the transitions in the video but very good quality How is the battery life compared to battery king 13 pro max
I swear some guy in the last video called it He said youre gna do that exact intro using the pill as part of the animation
"Not a fan of the dynamic island because its so crucial to the operations of the phone that you cant cover the camera anymore  This is a huge no no for me  I need the option to be able to cover the camera for full privacy while retaining full operation of the phone

Also the esim is just another way to tie the customer to the device  People are lazy and adding that extra step to change eco systems will enslave people to Apple  Not a fan of that either  

These two things are deal breakers for me"
1142 Nice 
No its copied from Edge Mask andriod app
I dont think so that it will be copied as already under display camera devices are available in market and soon tech will be at par with normal selfie camera
Can we just turn all the cutout magic off though
Mac wallpaper
How have apple managed to spin this absolute shit show into a positive Dynamic island is the second stupidest thing Ive ever seen them do closely behind the 700 fucking wheels
Dynamic island is the worst feature I could have in my phone
That fingerprint on the selfie camera close up shot whilst using dynamic island is super distracting 
Imagine watching 219 video which is this one with that dynamic island Why he didnt show us how ugly it is in this video
"Irrespective of the implementation to me it looks quite ugly and sticks out a lot Theyve made it usable but when theres nothing happening there its just a blank space in the middle rather than the edge

Its similar to a floating dock that will mostly make its way into some androids someday for sure"
Lg was first in every revolutionary features in mobile rip lg
Ive got a s22plus thought about making the jump to the 14 Still not sure yet
Whr is time stamp guy
The question is Is it worth it to go to Canada to get a sim slot version of the iPhone 14
What a intro 
Holy mother forking shirt balls that intro was on par if not better with Apples own promo shots the cinematics were insane Also loved the subtle audio queues at it being an island too
About the water proof without the SIM card there are a lot of phones with IP68 waterproof and even headphone jack This is just bullshit
What does the dynamic island look like when you are playing movies on your iPhone
where is the wallpaper from
THE INTRO JUST WOW I WATCHED IT 5 TIMES
what about battery life on 4nm process
Well having an always on display with wallpaper is kind of stupid It will definitely impact battery life  whats apple even thinking 
Does it have a headphone jack yet
Does anyone know what the widget on the lockscreen with all the dots is Im assuming its a clock but what app
"is nobody going to talk about how excessively large that camera at the back is or is it only me
makes the back look pretty ugly if you ask me"
Hats off  for u mentioned about LG
What A satellite connection to communicate Finally i can text my mom in from my bedroom
"Mkbhd should make all the intros for every company  
Production on a mkbhd video is sick "
It was a dope intro 
"As functional as the island thingy maybe its all a gimmick because close to no one uses their phone like that 

PS
I wonder why this review has low to one criticism especially when a similar Android would be getting thrashed for not having feature like fast charging"
Finally battery percentage is back on the battery icon
That intro was dope
Speaking of cameras if cropping into a sensor is a thing then I wouldnt be surprised if we can actually have an ultrawide camera being the main camera and that 1x is just a crop of the sensor We could basically go back to dual camera era where the better main camera is ultrawide but get a 1x for their desired focal length
055 Forgot to say you were filming videos for the car channel on the iPhone 14 Pro haha
This phone has enough Android features for me to finally switch to iphone for the first time  Its almost the same way I felt when I bought the Galaxy S3
wow your channel office look like a seperate software company
Thank you acknowledging LGs innovation and the LG V10 Real ones remember
Skip the iPhone 14 Wait for 15 with usb c
I was waiting on the reviews before buying this phone glad its finally here
Same old things implemented in Apple way and calling it revolutionary Still not a go for me Never purchased an iPhone and may not anytime soon
Is that Justin Vernon in the intro 
love for the team who making the intros so much ngl its just like official from apple
I cant wait till people compare the iPhone 14 pro to the s22 ultra I have the s22 ultra but as a former iPhone user I think itll beat it until the s23 ultra comes out I love Samsung phones now more but both companies are great at photography and videography
Im an android user Can someone please tell me if getting the iphone 14 pro is worth it or I should opt for the s23 ultra next year
Touch Bar on Macbook to Dynamic island on iPhone You better prove yourself worthy little guy otherwise puff 
If the Dynamic Island is the best thing about the new iPhones then Ill have to pass 
Why cant they just put Sony cameras in the iPhone lol
Finally upgrading from my Iphone 7 to Iphone 14 Exicted for the phone D
My main reason for upgrading from my 12 ProMax I really like that innovation apple put into the cutout
Does dynamic island mean that we can now UPLOAD STUFF WITHOUT KEEPING THE APP OPEN Finally finally we got it
iPhone camera Jack of all traits and master of none iPhone in general  The same thing every year
I was waiting for the LG V10 comment Thank You
Oh LG comeback please
"I feel like the way to test the crash detection without having to wreck a car is to chuck it from a long distance to a foam wall Might confuse the gyroscope and activate the crash detection but idk

I can not wait for the day they add usb c to the iPhones Every year it seems more like a pipe dream but damn lightning so fucking old
Should I get the new 14 pro if I want to upgrade from the iPhone 11
Im a dynamic island im a dynamic island
One thing about the Dynamic Island is that the  FaceID tech and camera are so close  definitely accidental touches incoming
Did he PURPOSELY dropped an iPhone 14 Pro My heart 
Do you get stock options with that Chevron hoodie
Always on displays seemed absolutely useless to me since they exist and apple didnt change that
 again nothing really exciting from the previous model
The only thing that makes me itch when I see the 14 Pro with a 13 Pro in my pocket is the Dynamic Island The functionality of it looks really cool Other than that its pretty much the same as the 13 Pro
Samsung will make a copy of it this year i am sure 
"I feel that the premium companies that are doing well for past 3 yrs or so will definitely copy this feature
It wont be exact same but they might keep that notch part only as a AOD 
It happened with the iPhone X too its the 1st phone with notch then came other phones copying it"
iPhone is boring asf and the 13 pro max has hella bugs so I prefer using my note 20 ultra over it and the notes camera is better Apple be paying you mk u know android is better
the dynamic island is a prime example of going for an iconic design over a good design which is very apple i guess
Well done on the intro
nah i will skip this year i phone 13 pro max is a beast still very happy using this phone
723 look like your Samsung needs a case lol sorry its the Adderal
17000 views in less than five minutes well done just for fun lets guess how many views this will have by the end of the day Please comment below my guess is 45 million
The moment he said people didnt realize its iPhone 14 Pro that actually made my decision not to upgrade from the 13 Pro Max Shall wait and see whats in store for the next years iPhone 15 Pro
It was so cool
LG V10 haha
Nice review 
"Question for Marquez

Do you plan on releasing any tech of your own If you were too big to fail what would you have in mind"
This video will get millions of views 
Smudges from finger prints on selfie camera Huge cut out when watching full screen video or playing game I will pass
"So to sum up the drawbacks
 crash detection Might be usefulbut for how many ppl How often do you crash and pass out
 satellite connectivity Again how often will you have to use that how often are you stranded
 lockscreen always on display not customizable eats some battery not super useful
 dynamic island is cool not not super useful Not sure about the whole its going to get copied thing
 the cameras are better just enough
 iPhone 14 series has become more expensive than it already was in Europe 
iPhone 14 128 GB is 1019 euros
iPhone 14 pro max 128 GB is 1479 euros

your turn Pixel"
What about galaxy buds pro 2 review
Tbh the same 5 core gpu with slight oc is the one halting me from upgrading from iPhone13Pro even the ram are the same
BUT THAT INTRO
Ive never used an always on display at any Android phones because its pretty unnecessary in my opinion like if I want to see something on my Samsung no ads they didnt pay me anything  Im gonna grab him and double tap to see a lock screen because if it will have some messages anyway I have to take up and use phone if I want to see the current time I will do the same And  people have also a simple mechanical watches or whatever watches so I actually dont need this feature And the main thing why I think its not as useful as it looks like is that I have to come closer and look at the phone to see the screen so anyway with it or without there is no difference for me
Bro seriously admitted to violating the terms of an NDA in a YouTube video
Indeed it will be Android start your photo copiers
Where do i get that iphone background you have Please help D
Nice editing
Better intro than apple commercial
I think that if you like the multitasking feature that the island brings you almost just have to deal with a tap opening the app opposed to a widget opening up right
Mr Beast will definitely test the iPhone car crash feature
No innovation in apple nowdays not worth for money Android is innovative
laowa macro 
The way casually dropped the phone and didnt bother to pick it up and continued with the vid xD
ahh you got it early Ill get it the next month 
Posted 1 minute before Mrwhostheboss
I dont have any dynamic island and I dont care
Born Sinner is one of my favorite J Cole songs surprised and glad to see it made an appearance
Something is wrong with the intro shot
How did they name it Dynamic Island and NOT just iLand
That intro that damn intro 
Why dont you share your wallpapers
This intro is that good good Wow
I always appreciate the detailed review bro It gives me an informed decision whether its really worth upgrading to the new iPhone 14 pro phones But the part that stands out to me is your watch tanlol Because I have the same thing going on Ive worn apple watch for years and now I dont even know if it will still even out
I so love MKBHD and the team came right out the gate with a full review 
Question to mkbhd Does the selfie camera and face unlock get dirty with fingerprints since you tap the island frequently
What will be copied The always on display or USB c 
Most wanted was USBc Other features are hmmm bs
"Dynamic island will never be copied on android Because they already reduced the notch to a single point in most cases or removed it all together
Make it back bigger for what  XD"
Im kinda confused hasnt cinematic mode always support 30 fps Even in the iPhone 13
Thank god they use dynamic island for low battery
Dynamic Island for me is the worst design feature they couldve chosen I prefer to have the notch rather than having a few pixels separating the Face ID and camera cutouts from the top of the display 
"Sorry but no phone is gonna copy that dynamic island crap because that notch is super ugly as hell The new change made it even more distracting Cant imagine how annoying it would be with full screen movies and gaming

Not just that Trying to reach over it to pop up stupid small stuff and also ending up with smudges over the camera"
AOD is something Ive been waiting for since I switched from Android a few years ago In typical Apply style they seemed to have a need to make it better than whats been on Android phones for a long time Do they really think anyone cares that its done in a way that the display is dimmer but maintains skin tones in images Give me an option for Simple AOD I just want to see the time and notification info Thats it If I want to interact with lock screen widgets like music Ill just tap my phone and use it from the lock screen
That intro looks like it coulda been straight out of the Apple event
Hey what about the battery  are the new iPhone battery better then the older models ie 13pro or pro max
Another fan boy video 
I will copy your intro Not the dynamic island
Bro in my country the iphone 13 pro max is worth 3800 if I convert the currency
I think I dont need to upgrade 13pro is enough
Here for the amazing editing and videography
that wordle just dated this video I know you can see the date but the Wordle is what I paid attention to
Hello and many blessings to you Marques Brownlee Please review the Sony Xperia gaming phone
Gloves in the background is a reference for new SoS via satellite feature
Dig the production value in this video Kudos
Once again youve answered all my questions after their presentations For years I look to you for real world content reviews and it will continue
1323
iphone pro res is a gimmick it s low  quality dude
24fps stans 
I am moving more on to the samsung side its more promising features and camera is so much better iphone is boring and they dont change their backover which is very annoying
CAN YOU SEND THE WALL
Dynamic island for the next 5 years
I was looking around about the international travel thing when dealing with eSIM but found prepaid eSIMs that can get me like 10 days of unlimited data in countries for about 35 so Im good Just need to switch to things like WhatsApp or something for texting then
Is it just me or does the dynamic Island resemble the second screen on the LG V10 and v20 Not exactly in design but functionality
Dynamic island anyone  Nah Ill go with a much smaller hole punch please the smaller the better thanks 
I think Apple is planning to go buttonless next gen Removal of the sim tray and introduction of haptics
It was the reverse actually with Cinematic Mode It has always supported 30fps but now the iPhone 14 Pro supports 24fps on top of 4K support
Props on the ifixit sponsorship
"What will happen when you put a glass screen protector on the phone
Will the cutout for the notch interfere with its functionalities due to the gap created by the thickness of the screen protector itself"
Really wish we got astrophotography mode as well Cmon apple
Suddenly the notch looks smaller 
Can a brotha get that wallpaper link Lol
Do AirPods Pro 2 please
Also like the lowkey shot of your new 8k hasselblad camera
I am a bit ocd about fingerprinting the camera lens Its a solid no for me to touch the front camera to operate that island
Why would anyone want to copy part of the screen effectively being blanked out  Androids been moving to a screen with no distractions This is just a stupid marketing gimmick 
Kanye West Graduation and J Cole Born sinner  youve great taste in music 
That intro is splendid
Jesus how he got the phone already LOL
Dynamic Island  Magnetic Fingerprint 
Imagine how good phones would improve if they stopped releasing every year But we know people are suckers to have the latest even though its the same thing every year Pretty sure as we speak the 15 is already half way finished and people who just preordered the 14 are already drooling for the 15 release 
I am so glad you mentioned LG Its a real shame LG did not get the limelight and recognition it deserved for its mobiles If we talk about mobile innovation it was always LG which was bringing all newer features later copied by Apples and others
the intro was a bloody WINNNNNNNN
I dont think Dynamic Island will be copied but the idea of the dynamic island will definitely cross over Having multi function on the notification area is always a plus and has been done before but apple always does it functionally
So Im upgrading from my dinosaur of a phone the iPhone 6s Its finally giving out but has served me well Ill be getting the iPhone 14 and I feel like Im not going to know what to do with it because its so much more advanced lol Looking forward to enjoying better battery life and the new camera Thanks for the review was very helpful
ohoooo just wait for xiaomi miui mods as those will become more common fast
Though apple had done a great job of hiding the pill shaped notch I really wish it shouldnt come to Android as Android phones have a much cleaner look If you want to copy something copy that insane fluidness iphone offers
That intro animation was slick
I think the Dynamic Island will be one of those things that people will get use to in a week and not care about after I think Samsungs Edge Panels are still better because it allows for quick multitasking
Classic Apple I bought the 13 pro last year and its been great but leave it to Apple to then finally update the screen in a meaningful way with the 14 pro and the dynamic island and inspire FOMO in the minds of all 13 buyers lol
Dynamic Island incoming call buttons are way to far from the big finger so they better be shown on the screen bottom
"First off  i am a mac book pro 15 inch mid 2014 owner and an Iphone XR owner and i love them  BUT 

Apple needs to be taught a lesson and that lesson needs to be taught soon 
People need to stop buying demonic Apple products for 1 year or maybe 2 Straight  no macs  iphones  heck  no adapters nothing 

Let me Explain  

 i love using logic pro BUT they soldered the SSD onto the motherboard ever since 2016 I recently went to an apple certified repair shop and asked them  what if i get an m1pro macbook pro and as soon as the warranty expires  the ssd fails me  How do u go about repairing it  They said itll cost me a hefty sum cause they replace the whole board I was like WhAT Like dayum replace 567 parts just cause one dont work  there aint nuthin logical about that  Another point is  on windows  1tb ssd  roughly 110  2 tb  roughly 2x 110   demonicapple  2tb costs 800  What  And you can t even replace it I have a dream   that for a few years straight up nobody buys any apple products  not even an adapter  Let s see those execs shit their pants and start asking questions like  FUCK what are we doing wrong We used to make all those profits and now nothing  I dont understand Its fucking marketing  i knew those idiots would fuck it up  To me they seem like money hungry apes that can not quench their thirst for money It walks along the lines of unethical There s isnt even any real advantage to having the ssd soldered I ve heard people say that it s faster No it s not We have the internet Anybody can check the numbers and the speeds of different ssd s out there Oh and just to put the cherry on top  iphone 13  amazing processor and hardware but its rocking the lightning port  usb 20 speeds Apple  i really hope u get yours and the EU puts you in place with regulations on ports and on right to repair They got hundreds of billions offshore in liquidities   This got outta pocket a long time ago  out of their consumers pockets to be exact They answer to no one and lack moral discernment Take care yall  But the processors are amazing and I respect the integration of the cpu and gpu and RAM   Cause that actually wields a big boost in performance I hope somebody serves them good  money hungry apes  And now they updated the look of the macbook air but havent done so for the the macbook pro 13 inch  If i buy the pro 13 inch i get the same old ass design  but the new chip  what   whass wrong with them  They have such twisted marketing strategies to milk their consumers of money as much as possible They did the same thing with iphones too While others bring new design to the table Apple holds on to the same design probably because they dont want to invest the money yet eventho they make such huge profits Sickening 

And now they ship different iPhones with different chips but the prices keep rising oh my God bruh lets start this movement  i m begging yall let us all stop buying their products for 1234 years  it would be amazing Screw them  theyve lost the human way"
This phone is so stupid Dont be dumb and buy this like all the YouTubers will Just stick with your 13 or prior year
IDK about the iPhone 14 but that hoodie is dope af
Apple cant get rid of the notch so they convince their consumers to embrace it
Great video I was debating keeping my 12 pro max and upgrading or not Think Ill wait until they do something more substantial with their next version
Someone suggested the notch on the older iphones should have been called the static peninsula
Nahhh the LG v10 was more like a windows task manager The dynamic island is more like an expandable widget
dude the 14 series is just a bad upgrade anyone can see that Stop appreciating laziness from these companies
Personally I dont think Android devices will be copying this feature Most Android devices are already based on small punch holes and it really makes no sense to have it implemented Apple only made this feature to somehow conceal the large cutout which is distracting
"Considering you run a whole channel with an iPhone makes it feel like the perfect tool to start a channel definitely a well worth investment looking at it that way 
Any video I make isnt just shot on my iPhone but also edited on it as well so theres no doubt in my mind that its a great phone for anyone considering becoming a creator"
Marques  Can the 48MP camera finally take a clear picture of the moon
Redmi and Xiaomi will definitely copy it
"Copy what A 2015 feature like always on display Or a 2019 feature like the display cutout

I used to be an Apple fanboy but bragging about car crash detection come on I had that on my Pixel for years Cant wait for apple to release another feature where you can set an arrival time when walking alone and if you dont respond to the notification at the set time the phone will automatically contact your emergency contacts Or maybe emergency video recording where the phone can record upload and stream video and location to emergency contacts when activated Apple fanboys will think its revolutionary when released in 34 years"
I think it looks good and brings more functionality to the notch but its literally a glorified notification bar
Based on this review I can safely wait for the iPhone 20
"i was gonna give the credit for the dynamic island thing to apple but woah  MHBHD just revealed the origin of this useful gimmick
RIP LG"
Great Content Marques Brownlee
That is actually such a cool way to use the notch
Love Easter Egg when hesitating to press download button on Todoist haha Who knows knows and you know it too Marques
Gimmick island
As an Android user I hope this new feature never comes to Android phones or at least not exactly the same way
1713 precisely why we need at least Thunderbolt 3 on iPhone 15 Pro ProRes video takes forever on lightning port and with thunderbolt you can stream it directly to Mac no iPhone storage required
I was skeptical at first with the Pro iPhones this year but that camera looks so 
After this people just gonna call it the pill
Not liking the broad pill shaped cutout AOD disppointed me the most i mean the dimmed wallpaper
How did you leave out all the security benefits of having no sim Its so much safer
What About Battery Life
Android will copy this
The dynamic Island feature isnt meant to be a feature if the peel shape wasnt there in the first place Its no different from any other notifications but at least its a clever way to make the peel shape look usable
Just coming from mrwhosethe boss s video love you both videos
Xaomi and Oppo Vivo already on it to copy the dynamic island notch
What is 5G  
Overrated like every iphone
i have a question what if you sneak your iPhone onto a rollercoaster will your crash detection go off That brings up the new apple watches as well
Is there any way to turn off the dynamic island and use the phone the old fashioned way
If Im getting it for free through some kind of promotion sure but Im looking at the same phone as my 13 with what the Androids call a punch hole so for over 1k no thanks apple still love you tho
This is the first weak review by MK
anyone know why iphone 14 pro is 300 more expensive when i would preorder from germany If im on general page withoud the de its 999 and with the de its 1299
Im going to ask again does the dynamic island goes down when you slide down to bring the whole screen down
1720 but theyre going portless before they use Type C Why to handicap the camera progress theyre making
"i love how on apple you have now the 1000 euros plebs version wich is a copy past of the previous gen and a premium version
as an iPhone user i dont want to feel superior only toward the adroid user but also toward others iPhone users who are poorer than me and can only afford and 1000 euros device"
515     what an awsm shot at cameras
Anyone know if the Dynamic Island finally tells you if your VPN is on or if you still need to pull the notification shade or control center down
iPhone wins the game again Sorry android one day youll get a win
Dont know why google never thought of this 1st
"Honestly what a great truck for the price here in Canada 4x4 is a must but its everything you really need in a truck considering the price Nice thing about Toyota is you pay what the price is on the website Problem is wait time to get one    
lol"
Hello Marquees can I have an iPad Pro Im going through rough times and itll help me through college
Cinematic video always supported 30 FPS It didnt support 24 FPS Why is every reviewer getting this wrong
"Applecreates a new trend

Android Hippity Hoppity its now my property"
iphone bezels still look so fat and ugly lol looks like 2019 samsung
Apple fans are so excited about the gimmicks remember how hyped up the touch bar was
fake multitasking 
My always on display only shows the moment I nudge or look at it when on a flat surface Its off the rest of the time
Dont know how I feel about that AOD For me the thing about it has always been the fact that it only shows your time and everything else is black a perfect night clock All that extra stuff on the screen takes the entire purpose of AOD away IMO
Why is the embargo period for iPhone 14 so short
AOD of apple is terrible because its literally the whole display dimmed instead of fully off with just some clock
Wait is MagSafe a thing
With a screen protector dynamic island is weird
Just realised that the baseline iPhone 14 pro cost 1352 dollars where I live and not 1000 dollars fkn absurd
Floss 
I like the iOS 16 software
This is a surprise review I didnt think the Apple NDA was over until at least tomorrow Eve Jobs Instagram post was dead on  essentially a copy of last years iPhone Tada 
HOODIE SEASON LETS GO
Today Floss haha
Marques you might be feeling slightly less battery life than the 13 Pro Max because the battery is 30MAH less
"Why no one said Apple copied Huawei in the satellite messages

Is that because huawei dont have Google services and not available in US

Is it fair that Huawei is banned in US but Apple is not banned in China

My opinion anything Apple cant get rid of it they shine it and make a story from it

After several years they will hide this island and call it the mystery hidden island "
How can a horrible copy be copied 
What do you mean cinematic mode now supports 30fps It was always 30fps which was the problem lol
Samsung would copy the notch and gonna say they invented this 
It already has been copied few days ago Video is late lol
"Im surprised iFixit got a mention As with all other third party repairers they must be disgusted with Apples policy of locking a battery to a phone Only the local Genius bar can replace the battery and reprogram the phone to the new battery without losing functionality and also at a ridiculous cost There is only one reason for this and we all know what that is
Apart from that Apple lost the edge on phone innovation many years ago They now have AOD which as you say has been around for years Nothing really new in this device but if I did ever consider an iPhone it would be purely for video not because of the late arrival of new technology and certainly not because of the company"
Leave it to apple to turn the notch into a feature
Probably an upgrade for me from an 11 Pro Max Great video
Its tempting but Im still going to hold out with my iPhone 11 until Apple ditches the lightning port
Intro is amazing
The intro is even too good
That intro deserves a raise for the editor
uhhh those fingerprints sticking to the front cameras trying to touch the island
I dont get the hype about this island While using all of these cool features you dont see what kind of mobile internet you are using And that could cost you some cash
If you cant make a real improvement show some good looking but not so useable thing and the world will go crazy
Fucking epic intro 
Cause Im a island boy
probably not same thing with the notch some phones copied it initially but eventually dropped them
Marques you are the best
Its really nice I just cant got back to apple after my android experience Just so much more flexibility for me But this is really nice
Why there is no z flip 4 and fold 4 review 
Haha Elevated heart rate run up the stairs or something no just me hahaha Nice one Marques
You should grab a RC and tape the iPhone to it then crash into a wall see if it realises its in a crash
Hey Marq Pls Pls Pls make a review on Moto Edge 30 Ultra Need to know Your opinion on it
I bet this  design of iPhone pro will remain next 2 to 3 years 
The notch shit might be copied by cheap phones that always try to mimic the iphone but I think the android flagships are focused on getting rid of the front camera through pixels and making that look as seamless as possible
"
Thats a ripoff scam  SARCASTIC"
"Dont you think this dynamic island feature is going to make the selfie cameras dirty
I mean hand dirts"
Marques you didnt speak about night mode
Its all about the small and refined changes that apples does every year in a very apples own way
Please who knows the intro song
I always love your intro but this set a new bar wow
You could test crash detection by using an RC car
Can you do a 14 pro vs 14 I cannot decide which to get I have an 11 so either is a nice jump
So no ones gonna ask why MKBHD is running up the stairs then  
Your intro game is only seeing up with every video 
TECHTEMBER
Man Im in love with your intros
The lack of excitement and negative review seals my decision to not upgrade from my X I almost did
That LG part was unexpected
Enjoy getting smudges on your front lens
Bruh why is the new Clock lock screen font on iOS 16 so huge Its practically braille
I sure hope it doesnt get copied I think the dinamic island does everything you can do in the pulldown menu on other phones Its a glorified notification pannel
Real ones know the intro song is reused
Seems really weird to me that you cant have the background turn all the way of with the always on display Seems really bad for battery
Notice how MKBHD gives a subtle rant about every new thing in the iphone
They need to make it so the user can adjust the brightness of the always on in settings or have it turn off at certain hours That will keep me up at night I dont need a little nightlight in my room
no company can beat iphone
Ill stick with the 13 for now very happy with it so far
I didnt see you talk about the battery did I skip something
Its a gimmick because the other models dont have and you wont click on it when you hold the phone in a normal way because its at the top
As someone who bought many LGs in the past I wouldve never made that connection to the V10 Good shit man
The embargo is lifted  so excited to get my deep purple 14 Pro on Friday 
What a masterpiece intro
idk why MKBHD pointed out cinematic mode is 30fps its been 30fps since it came out on the iPhone 13 series The difference now is that 24fps is now available for the 14 series His checkmate 24fps fans actually falls flat here since they added a 24fps mode
RIP LG mobile You are still remembered
hows your day going Marques 
super biggest punch hole in the world 
BEST INTRO EVER
"Am i the only who hates the Dynamic Island It looks cheap outdated  its on TOP of your screen so it doesnt feel natural to reach it with your thumb 
Imagine you put fingerprint reader on top of your phone Most people who recorded using it including MB the phone is always on the desk or awkwardly pressed with the thumb"
Whats going to happen when everyone tries out the satellite connectivity the day these are released
The Intro was insane
definitely said connecting AirPods twice
Your best intro so far I cant lie
when Marques said look at this graph I immediately heard that song meme play in my head
"So its worth it to upgrade from 11 to 14
Pro max"
Bro the intro go crazy
Love that wallpaper Where can I get it
Anyone planning to upgrade from iPhone 11 Pro Max
is intro shot on iphone 14
Dynamic island doesnt look new to me its just a notification toggle at the top of your phone I guess its the apple way Its a cool  add up though
Sorry M 22minsAds every 6mins gets you DislikeAbort  now You or Google or Both are taking the piss 
That intro was honestly the sexiest thing Ive ever watched True movie studio type stuff Marques
Apple just killed one handed operation with this dynamic island  
Dynamic island sounds like a Pokemon attack lmao Hey Suicune  use Dynamic Island 
Drive your car and throw it out the window
How are fingerprints on your selfies
Its mind bending that Apple still doesnt offer real splitscreen multitasking at least in their bigger Plus Max versions That would be a real good reason for people to buy a heavier more expensive model It wouldve been also nice if the Pro versions supported the use of the Apple Pencil
I am currently using  Samsung Galaxy note 10 plus and considering moving to Apple 14 pro max however one concern I have regarding the dynamic island that very few are mentioning  If I am going to poke around the front camera to interact with apps how much dirt or oil will accumulate there and whither it will impact the selfie experience  If I will need to clean the screen above the camera to take a clear photo
L take as usal via MKBHD
TEAM EARLY
Hey Marques do you use a lens support with the robot Some of the fast movents have a bit of a wiggle similar to when you use an ef lens with a follow focus tends to wiggle the lens when you change focus fast still looks amazing anyways
This phone feels uninspiring Not worth the upgrade at all
The OG Hoodie
I guess the best lockscreen picture for battery would be all black I normally turn off all ways on displays I prefer the battery life 
I love the island notch
lg v20 was the one to introduce dynamic display like feature
"How can you love this big notch 
Those are really not that useful  features its really ugly 
And now Im concerned because my Theory is that apple will keep now the notch for ever 
And thats why when my iPhone will get old Im  definitely switching to galaxy 13 pro max user"
When he said MUI I almost turned into it  Goku
You didnt mention anything about the battery
Its not hoodie season in California Sweating my butt off over here LOL
Finally 
whatever you are trying to saythere is nothing else better in iphone14 rather than that dynamic islandExcept this iphone 14 pro is a normal iphone 13nothing else in it
Did he just drop the phone
It open doors for 13s to be affordable nice
"Copulent things I wish you would have added in this review

Why couldnt you test the satellite feature Doesnt it let you send short messageslocation to friends

Wish there had been a side by side comparison of max screen brightness

Wish you would have shown us the LG phone that they got the dynamic island from"
Probably wont be upgrading my SE till next year or when the USBC capable iPhones come out
lmfaoooo SERIOUSLY
719 the fact that this dude used such a simple ass layout for Android AOD shows he has become an Isheep AOD is fully customizable and on Samsung you can even use puctures change the clock alerts widgets almost everything but NOOOOO he uses such a basic example of Androids 
Car crash detection can be tested via robot hand Some shake with rotation
that intro was sickkkk
Its already been copied on the Xiaomi phone
Also me still waiting for the Galaxy Z Fold 4 review 
Why the hell is none talking about the fact that it doesnt really have a 48MP camera because its a quad bayer layout
I think it will be just hard to reach the bottom of the phone just because for this feature all the time
Really hope there wont be as many accidental triggers as the fall detection on the Apple Watch  if Im already fired up enough to hit stuff I really dont need my watch to start beeping lol
I phone sucks Samsung 4 life
"Before Always On Display

Omg still no AoD on iPhone

Now that we have AoD

I dont use it"
SHOW US THAT X2D
I see a lot of blurry selfies in the future
Idk if i should upgrade from 11 pro maybe ill just change the battery
I dont agree you can easily tell its the new iPhone it looks completely different on the front
Why does he look angry during the selfie shot  1802
"Good review as always 
Do you think that it is worth it to upgrade from my current iPhone XR to the 14 Pro"
I feel like the dynamic island is gonna lead to a lot of fingerprints on the front camera and microphone sensor Other than that its cool
"remember hurricane Katrina
all cell towers were down"
great video marques what wallpaper are u using 
As an S22 plus user I really only like the utility for the dynamic island for map directions and though Im sure more things will come later Ill still prefer a non obstrusive hole punch
Dynamite Island Is Only One Thing Depends Phone Cost And apple Simple
"Let me just assume this is how the discussion went between the apple developers and designers
Hey guys 2022 is drawing to an end we need to release the iPhone 14 any idea 
Designers  Guys to be honest we have ran out of ideas but you know something lets maintain the same shape like the iPhone 13 and widen the camera and the speaker space 

Developers Yeah such a great idea we will move the notification to that part and call it dynamic island  
Also we can introduce the always on display to the screen this will leave the consumers in a state of awe 

The irony of me typing this with an apple phone is sarcastic"
"1258 Steve would have instantly canceled this idea Fingerprints on the Frontcam And how inconvenient is it to reach the absolute top of the screen to control music
How stupid has apple become
And on the other hand notifications went down to the bottom because its easier to reach"
Yohooooo
These intros are getting out of hand
Bro I dont know why but you remind me will I am
May be next year Apple
1735  I kinda expect the next Pro Max to have 8k And if Apple wants to make a nice leap to usbc they should surprise us by having a thunderbolt 4 port on the next Pro Max to better offload the 8k footage while the regular size iPhones get usbc now that would be cool
Always on is more like always dim display hahaha whats the point of the OLED if it doesnt go black
Why dont make the navbar more useful It can be dynamic island too
the bulge is obscene
Lol at the clip of Marques thinking about installing Todoist
Didnt you just broke the NDA by saying publicly that you used it in public Bro
i have a sexy lady pole dancing on my AOD that is the Samsung way
I remember when Steve Jobs was alive and Apple was the innovative company Now Apple every now and then has some cool things but just does not innovate like other companies do Dont get me wrong I have a bunch of apple products and love them but I wish they would take a leap every now and then and actually try and innovate more especially on the hardware side
What about the battery 
I hope they dont copy that stupid thing Notifications are right where they belong Only disturbing you when needed This was a stupid idea cant believe the masses have fallen for it But hey its the 
Is there a right way to do the always on display To say it is the Apple way is only because android phones before had AoD which people got used to and they thought Apple might also do the same Had Apple came up with the features first and then Android phones later introduced the same feature differently will it be like  Oh in typical Android fashion they came up with the same feature in the Android way
Test if the crash detection triggers if you fall off a longboard or an electric scooterbike
Gonna hold on to my 13 Pro for the next 3 years and see what happens next This is definitely an s update to the 13 Pro
Only thing which could effect the sale is esim As a traveler I wouldnt buy this model
"Would you guys recommend on switching from an S21 to this iPhone 
Been on the Samsung train since S6 and still in love with Android but feel like the iOS software has come a long way 
Thoughts"
The iPhone 14 pro also dynamically changes your financial situation
Watching this on my iPhone 6s 
If you value money buy iPhones 45 years apart
These outros are getting better by the video Love it 
Think its time to put the 8 away and upgrade
This hole punch is worst than having a notch
Is the battery life better or worse compared to the iphone 13 proMax
the notch is so wide and nasty  bad for watching movies or playing games on it
Still mourning the LG G and V phones
That hoodie 
Did you notice Marques Gmail messages
The fact that they compared the new A16 to the A13 on lauch says a lot about them as a company This is why I would never in my life own an iphone
Its the same phone as last year WT EFF
Man we need LG back with all them features its like they always gave you a lil peek into the future
Let me get that Wallpaper
1816 mac 3
Any idea hows the battery life overall on these new phones Im curious because of the widening gap between the pro and the nonpro 14s
That dynamic island thing still looks ugly and obtrusive
Markass Brownie
Is the charging same as last year
I did I just see Born sinner COLEWORLD
Had to replay the intro a few times Its so clean
"148 you need to understand how a normal person doesnt buy a new phone every year

A comparison to last year would be pretty useless since the people who think about buying the iPhone 14 dont own an iPhone 13
2019 seems much more reasonable since thats what most people are gonna be upgrading from"
This guy received unreleased product from Apple thats crazy huge respect buddy
"Those cameras though Cant wait to mess around with those 48mp files in Lightroom Curious how theyll perform in studio and outdoors Bummer about the focusing distance of the main camera I bet you could have gotten some crazy bokeh if you could move the camera closer

Im putting out a photography first review next week You forgot to call me out when you mentioned Peter McKinnon and Tyler "
I mean damn the intro to this was as smooth as the dynamic island animations That shit was so clean
you know that management team that always changes something in the procedure just to justify their salary  same here with Apple
Uploaded just 23 mins ago and 15 lakh people watched itsuch Amezing 
I havent even finished the video and I am going to give it a like already because that 30 second intro was insane I was like the pikachu meme just watching  amazing as I type this I rewatched it twice
Born Sinner 
WowWhat an Intro Watching every intros twice
Using AllttAs music for your intro tracks never fails to disappoint
The blurry selfie feature
Lots of old music I love it 
Its like fifa 23 same game same mobie with slightly changes
Song anyone
Love how you just dropped it and kept talking 
Man those camera modules look as big as you Irises
Naming it Dynamic iLand would have hyped the hype even further XD I hope it doesnt ruin the front cam
When will I learn not to be tempted each year
The dynamic island let fingerprints get into your selfies
The dynamic island is the equivalent of makeup on a pig
Wait for them to put USB C on it not worth now
Why didnt Tim digitally remove the ugly iPhone stand in the intro 
Why do I get the feeling that Marques doesnt like the 14 Pro that much
The island should be called the unibrow
Ive had my watch detect a fall when all I did was lower my arm quickly like trying to grab something falling off a counter
That is a nice looking hoodie
"aghhhhh pro or pro max
I cant choose"
"Who cares just another iPhone
Not really excited this time upgrade an iPhone"
Dowloading todoist 
this phone is so fucking pretty i cant
Loved the todo list easter egg
Display overheating
One Day I will buy the latest iPhone 
The dynamic island has serious touch bar energy
Mkbhd should feature snoopdog lol the intro feels gangster
Why cant Apple just have a phone without a notch
Hows the battery
Dynamic island is a gimmick
Intro on fleek baby
They really went the Its not a bug its a feature route eh  I still think its ugly
Hey Marques been watching your videos for years It just hit me that I wasnt subscribed and youtube still pushed your great content Well the mistake has been corrected
The biggest problem I find with the iPhone now is there are very much like bmw super super boring design and frankly ridiculous price tag
Pro ask iPhone 1 ok
I know for a fact if there was an android phone that had a notch like that he would be ripping into it for being lazy outdated and crap
does the front camera smudge up after using the dynamic island a lot
You really love this song Marques It was in another video of yours too
the apple watch tan line in that one picture
WHOAA THAT INTRO WAS AMAZINGGG
"Maybe you should go to an island with the V Raptor XL to test the dynamic range 
Dynamic Island 
"
"Animations is dope in MKBHD videos
Getting better and better  creative every single video"
I think you forgot to remove the stand from the intro animation 
The pill eats further down into the screen and the space above is unusable not better than a notch
Just call the dynamic island DI
The intros are just so so dopekudos to brandon and vince And also the entire team
"People just overhyped dynamic island functionality
Android has that functionality in their status bar and in the notification bar for years"
Esim also makes it more difficult If you want to switch to Android
Ask your lawyer if he wants you using editable iOS 16 iMessageif youre involved in litigationsaw that in a Scott Adams vid to give credit Did I miss it in this one
201 I got curious and paused here Really nice detail to have the Docs preview be the script for the Dynamic Island section of the video Maybe not international but still
Man I am really excited to get my 14 Pro Max The Dynamic Island is such a creative way to turn something usually seen as a weakness into something functional I will admit that the AOD is not exciting to me and I will be turning that off first thing during setup Seems like a waste of battery when I have an Apple Watch I can just glance at
Too many ads he promotes I dont like this review
I really dont understand why they didnt make use of the fact that its an oled for the aod and turn off all but some pixels
That hoodie is really nice also yea the iPhone 14 design isnt the best but the camera is very impressive
1250 made me realize that well be seeing a lot of smudgy selfies from now on Its already frustrating to see people not cleaning their cameras before taking a picture now it will be an even bigger issue if you add a clickable area right next to the camera cutout
Samsung wont have to copy it if they figure out how to hide the front camera
Wait Hows the battery life like He touched on it just a lil bit
"Lol ya its 2022 and apple has figured out lock screen
And you say some new shits will be copied Grow up kid"
Hoodie is 
The dynamic island just seems like a over hyped its a feature not a bug well marketed notification bar Granted it is integrated well but its not something you need the cutout for anyway in fact it would be better without the cameraface id and to have it as a totally software option But of course its Apple and it is marketed well
i wonder how the Crash Detection will handle rollercoasters or those that elevate you super high and then drop you dont know the name lol
Seriously There is NO pro to not having a physical simtray anymore Sure include dual esim bluetooth and cloud storage I would still like SD card support a headphone jack AND my physical simtray Stop chipping away features in an effort to sell me more shit
Will others copy a way to hide a notch I know its a pill shaped cutout but the size of it makes the top visible screen is practically useless when they already move on to smaller cutout thats getting more and more invisible
Basically the notification bar
"Come on  apple always waits 10 years later to come out with things because it makes it better  Now we can look at our non moving uncustomizable  home screen at 1 Hertz

Thumbs up to the dynamic Island though"
As much as I find these small improvements over the 13 wicked coolI think Ill hang on to my 13 pro until a USB C iPhone comes out  Not sure if Im alone in this but I am genuinely surprised the 14 wasnt the phone to finally ditch lightening
I always found always on displays so pointless Double tap the screen if you need to see anything
Samsungs infinity O punchhole is way better than dynamic island  And UDC tech is developing very fast so why bother copying 
MKBHD is the king of intros Final
That hoodie looks SO good
Dynamic Island  Solving problem that was never before  Apple
"Me iphone 14s are being manufactured here in India finally their prices will drop in the indian market
Tim cook Lol So anyway im thinking of getting a new yacht i didnt like the colour of the old one  "
From watching this video i noticed that the battery percentage is now available in the battery setting
1323 Tribute to the legend LG  V10
Cinematic mode was already 30fps lol it now supports 24fps
Iphone 12 13 and 14 are like Superman Supermen Suupermen
Honestly the dynamic island would have been great few years ago when smartphones started to have front camera holes As for the format of the video not a big fan of the editng the titles w music interrupt the flow of the video and as mush as I like the choice of music  font  effect on font it kinda looks like YT videos from few years ago
Them still doing Lightning in the 14 models makes me glad Im sticking with my 13 at least another year
Big ups to the guy in the comments that came predicted that intro on another mkbhd  video I see youu big W 
poor LG lmao
All iPhones look the same but Apple claims they change the features
DAMN THAT INTRO THO 
"Apple Fans We have Dynamic Island
Android users We got edge sense and miniapp window"
Thanks for the great video Do we need auto brightness enabled to get the 2000nits of brightness outdoors
Refresh rate is 60Hz right
New iPhones become less and less impressive every year Idk why anyone would keep buying a new one every year
No usb C yet 
1143 NOICE 
1501 Andrew menacingly walking towards Mac haha
Not gonna lie lamest intro ever
Am I the only one who noticed him say connecting AirPods twice
306 my man just casually drops a 1000 phone 
I hope you squashed that Spotted Lantern Fly after taking its picture 
i still have no idea about the overall battery and night mode sample marques
2 notification screens is all the island is to me
YOOOOUO
Apple should of named the Dynamic Island an iNotch 
For me is exactly the opposite Esim is now much better for travel then physical sim you can buy it from an app and have service even before you left the plane Its silly to buy physical sims at this point
"I smiled at his calendar widget

Knee Physical Therapy
Review the new iPhone
Floss

The essentials ahahaha"
Outdated looking already
what is wrong with youtube compressionyour nice intro full  of artifact even on 4k it did not happen when I watch other video
While it looks great and considered as a future I would say dynamic island is UIUX Disaster It will be hard for one hand user trying to get to the top to tap the dynamic island haha
Am i the only one that dont like that island in the middle of the screen keeping my 13 pro 
Has already been
They probably compared it to the A13 because they know it isnt enough of an upgrade from the 12 or 13 pro
So before the Apple event you exactly knew what iPhones were coming up and notch will be called Dynaimc Island
just apple
Lol no one is copying the innovated juggernaut that is Apple
the notch stayed for so long so the dynamic island could run
"Dynamic island looks cool but it is also just a software gimmick that is easy to copy I mean Samsung already using the cutout for notifications It is also touch sensitive It is not a big step to make that dynamic
But it is also not enough feature to upgrade"
As always an excellent balanced review  looks like a solid iPhone this year and the Dynamic Island is a great implementation of a screen cut out
LG V10  Forgot about it
You know when MKBHD is not excited about a phone But cant say Apple just wants your money by giving you the same phone from last year Oh which was copied from the previous year And apple was supposed to be a good software company and now the software sucks
Also a really nice pro tip good one man lmao
Trinidad  Tobago hoodie D
God damn The intros just keep getting better Shoutout to the editors for their amazing work
"I do hope that the Dynamic Island will not be copied and we just drop notches and cutouts they are ugly
I rather have no selfie camera than a cutout or this terrible feature I mean its at the top of the screen so the worst reachable area"
Is the new brightness outdoors actually good or does it last for 5 mins before the phone overheats and auto dims to less than half brightness 
the intro damnnnnn
Satellite connectivity is awesome I use to hike a lot and this feature can be lifesaving
Skipping the update this year
"Iam from INDIA is it good option to buy the US version 14pro as it only supports Esim or else should i go with the INDIAN variant which has a physical sim support how much this will effect for a longterm user while travelling network changing etc 
INDIAN variant of pro version is lot pricier as compared to US variant in IND pro starts at 1636after conversion as of know"
yess i love hearing that intro song 3
Yeah dont get this phone get the 13 Pro
During MCO due to pandemic last year Iphone 13 so many people buy i dont think this year ip14 will be successful due to increased price
Always love to see these intros madddddd kudos
That transtion from back to front though 
Wow these intros are getting more and more impressive
How does dynamic island deal w text messages No one shows that lol
"Its the best iphone Apple makes right now

Duh You sound like a Apple shill on stage 



Ooooooo you can now replace the glass back when you break it Ooooooo"
This Intro is beyond sick
The wallpaper bro i need it
Mkbhd says this will be copied but I say this should be copied man
"The Dynamic Island is cool on paper terrible in practice it steals way more screen real estate and makes watching full screen video much worse and also the whole touch it for notifications and stuff will inevitably result in the faceID sensors and front cameras getting smeared in fingerprintsso much for the upgraded quality LOL
Cool looking gimmick but thats it"
Just one thing why Apple doesnt fix the lens flare 
"Every android phone In a few days you will forget your front camera pill is even there
Apple Hey dont forget about me Im always here and youve got mail"
The old intro music 
For the eSIM I bet that EU did not allow it for their market I think this will bring short term issues for those traveling and purchasing local SIM card but long term it will push carriers for a far simpler and much welcomed purchase options via esim
The intro     Bro
S22 Ultra is much better and now even much cheaper
Time to retire my 7 plus to a 14 pro 77 14 
The real discussion should be whether to go for iphone13 or iphone14 as pros are on different levels
Dynamic island is cool BUT the main problem with notchcut out is it takes out space when watching full screen video Dynamic island aint got shit on that
Dont flash symbols that you dont even understand clown 
Apple is not expecting those using A15 Bionic of last year to upgrade thats why they compared it with A13 Bionic it makes sense
22 minutes Yes Im gonna watch it all
Test crash detection on Rollercoasters
If your Phone falls it wont get the g forced it gets in a car crash tho
That intro is Apple level Bad ass
Im on the Pixel 6 Pro and considering making the jump  aside from a few things Im completely in love with with my Pixel the big one is that telephoto lense is sensational Would you say iPhone 14 pro is beating that In terms of video and stuff I know Apple crushes Google but just wondered when it comes to certain camera elements that I personally felt Pixel did better is there more of an argument the other way now
I think you meant that cinematic mode now supports 24fps When introduced it was 30fps at 1080p Now it is is 4k up to 30fps with 24fps also available
i happily await the day they copy the dynamic island but will the copycats did it better than apple
I think you and your team should give us a short movie We have been watching your editing skills the creativity Surely a 15 minute movie is overdue
I wish I had a iphone lol
First reaction  Dang that intro 
Are we really still consuming this A negligible upgrade Every year Are we insane
Theres a concept made by someone on Reddit showing Dynamic Notch and honestly I think that looks better than the island Too bad itll never be done as Apple needs reasons for you to get the latest phone
My preferred notch is no notch
The Dynamic Island is super super clever Im looking forward to using it
So no one will talk about that incredible intro 
iPhone just made international travel difficult Now they expect us to carry 2 phones 
Appel is getting boring
Tbh apples implementation of AOD feels pointless and half assed
Why did the Spotted Lantern Fly have to get a cameo I am so sick of those things Great video tho as always
But why is that intro so tho 
You probably had this phone for 2 weeks
I just like the design
Still hideous looking thing tec channels cried about borders on phones for ages because it spoils immersion then champion a bloody hole in the middle of your screen Utter stupidity
everytime you touch the island  you dirty the front camera lens
I hope you smashed that Lantern Fly after you took some pics of it
You cant turn the battery percentage on on the iphone 11 At least on my phone
Lmao the seagull and ocean sounds around the dynamic Island XDXD I love it lol
They really need to come up with a subscription service that makes getting into the newest phones easier or automatic Phone tech just isnt progressing and Im literally just going to hold onto my XS until it no longer functions
I hope you killed that lantern fly Marques
My Man
Android has this feature before 
The downside of dinamic Island is that you could tap near into the selfie camera and stain it
Never owned an iPhone but never miss its reviews
Awesome video as always with a sick sountrack
Im waiting for s23 ultra  Screw Apple
I feel have seen this review before
3D Touch should be a pro feature and its gaming use cases where never touted
when we are getting the gifts of your old iPhone 13 pro or iPad 2022
Im curious about how the crash detection works when were out jumping cars 
Wow they made the iPhone look worse 
Could you do a video about the EUs USBC requirement in relation to how you believe Apple will handle this change
"An iPhone with punch hole camera indisplay fingerprint scanner and an option to turn onoff dynamic island anyway

Would you keep it on or off"
"Give it a few years and crash detection will be dead 

I wont be buying the 14 at all But if I did why would I keep crash detection on when my car can do this perfectly well

This years iPhone is the most disappointing ever"
great video great phone buy it
"Great Video Except one small mistake
Cinematic Mode was always available in 30fps They introduced it in 24fps now"
Android will never copy this 
Try the crash detection with brake test 60 mph and then emergency brake in a closed environment definitely
The only features I think I will use on this thing is mindlessly scrolling through Twitter and being left on read
The only reason im excited for big apple launches is these sick intros
KILL THAT LANTERN FLY YOU WERE FILMING
Remember LG V20
Is there going to be a full review for the Z Fold 4
The only thing most people are happy about the iPhone 14 is the fact that the 13 is a bit more affordable now
After iPhone 14 launch getting a 128gb iPhone 13 for 487 after discounts in India
I want to get the phone and try go carting with it and slam into a wall of the track super hard and see if it goes off
that intro tho  perfection
My god that intro you know he steps it up when its a new iPhone review
Q
I just hope other companies dont copy the dynamic island
Them INTROS BE SPICY
Congrats to Everyone who is Early and Found this Comment
Did you kill that spotted lantern fly in the sample video lol
But for reals the dynamic island is nice personally  Im not a fan of the notch Androids have gotten ways to get rid of it Apple should work on it
ill upgrade when they use usb c
Ordered my 14 Pro Max coming from a 13 Pro Max cant wait to receive it 
I would only get the iPhone 14 Pro because of the Alwayson display Like finally
So if yall are getting these Unreleased phones before Apples announcements those WOWs and WOAHs from iJustine are fake 
So it still has pwm LMAOOO fuckkk
Not switching to USBC what an own goal
I remember my Fitbit used to always auto detect a workout when I cut the grass thought I was riding a bike  guess I walk fast 
I want that nemo wallpaper
The satellite communication feature can also be used to send your location to a contact when not in an emergency That is something that you can test
"Thx for your reviews
Probably the only channel that I watch almost every reviews"
What Im thinking is what will they do whenif they ever wanna do under screen cameras
My only concern with the dynamic island is that people will definately have a dump of fingerprints on their front cam and gotta clean their camera everytime they wanna take a selfie
I pray whoever eyes catch this comment god gives you the strength you need to over come every battle your facing May the dark thoughts and overthinking the doubts exit your mind right now May replace confusion May peace and calmness fill in your life
intro 
From a UIUX perspective putting so many features on top of the screen where its hard to reach is not a smart decision Youre also placing fingerprints on your selfie camera reducing the quality of the image Not great from a design perspective
RIP LG V10 the real Dynamic Island phone from 10 years ago
"it turns off always on display
hmmmm"
God dawg I bet that phone is powerful as hell
Hello heres how I broke my NDA in the first minute of the video is a pretty impressive start
Anyone else went to search for the LG V10  
Just one simple questiondoes touching the dynamic island multiple times blur out the camera
Imagine being an Apple tester that is not employed by Apple WOW That is next level
Yayy My favorite hoody 
"The thing about dynamic island is that its hard to take advantage of one handed And how does it work landscape 

And one touch should definitely bring out the small display that bit makes no sense"
Why would anyone want to reach for the top of their 6 inch screen every few seconds
damn neat introo
my biggest concern about the 14 is the lack of the SIM tray how do you switch between two u locked iphones without one of them having a sim tray
That notch display is very smooth 
Id like the iPhone 14
You and your SO are going at it and you left the phone on the bed if EMS shows up youve unlocked an IRL award
Ofcourse the concept will be copied MKBHD 
I love the video I think a fun way to test out the crash detection would be going on roller coasters and see if it goes off
L phone
I have an edge menu that works mostly the same Along with a multi window button Both are reachable with one hand
Why no USBC
stranded on an island with this one
Now most people will learn to clean their dynamic island when taking a selfie cos of touches direct to the camera 
only apple has dense enough customersfanatics that will believe how something bad as a giant notch is somehow a great feature XD
Apple doing something innovative first that will be copied
U know the irony in it is They mock it then the copy and do it themselves Then theyll say I made it better Funny
When air pods 2 pro review
invented by LG 7 years ago haha
dude these into never disappoint never stop please
I hope you killed that lanternfly
Also missed is that there is now a dual band gps in these phones just fyi
"Apple is robbing people with that horrible battery and same design Same battery same Chipset even tho its 16 it performs exactly like 15 
But the prices are nearly 2000 in countries like India and UK 
Idk why Marcus always sucks up to them
Instead of pointing it out

And the battery Itll barely come for a whole day if AOD is switched on 
As years go on itll barely come for half a day as well"
How can it be copied if all of these features have been on Android for years already
That random drop test scared me lol
connecting AirPods twice D
Samsung already did it and they did it better Apple is always behind and yet for whatever reason People are still amazed at the Features or lack there of they get or dont Oh wow a dumb Island on my phone Too bad apple didnt do that to the other 2 models
Did anyone else notice he said connecting AirPods twice
OMG MKBHD is an absolute RockStar Im blown away on how fast hes getting views  comments at a Ferraris Pace Super Fast This review I have been waiting for it  MKBHD doesnt let you down in any way Hes super talented  so professional Thx so much for Posting  Sharing this truly wonderful video
Finally something android can copy instead of the other way around Hopefully
Literally always on display
I used to watch all your videos but now due to ads I just only watch what I extremely need
iphone got really good battery life but i just cant leave android iPhone is missing 2 much features
Dynamic iisland boys 
New features that android has for years
yes it will be copied by cheap china phones no one  cares about wats new  kind of factual clickbait
Dynamic Island Hope 3rd party apps will make use of it and will work as marketed
AOD is too late by apple
Did you record your last Auto Focus episode on the 14 pro max Quality seems better than the previous episodes you filmed
Yes  absolutely 
So the selfie cam will always be smudged and blurry now  thanks dynamic Island
i dont want to call 911
Always on display should have no wallpaper and option to toggle notification on or off
1322  COME ON GIVE THIS MAN A LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE
I got the 14 Max Pro and the Watch Ultra for 250 total through Verizon After trade ins its 3 bucks each monthly added in my bill D
Just arrived here after Mrwhosethebosss iphone 14 pro video Marques dont blame me Sorry
Android users will bash the dynamic island but just wait a little while android manufacturers will copy the hell out of it lol
The front camera is full of smudges after using dynamic island
The island just like the notch is a failure of design where screen space is removed in an ugly manner and folks pretend this was a good idea Give me a bezel with cameras in over wrecking a screen
527 Knee PT Is your knee ok
235 will acceleration of tesla trigger it
Im waiting to see a high altitude drop test to see if crash detection activates
The subtle seagull sounds when highlighting the Dynamic Island in the intro its the attention to details like that that set your channel apart
Damn 14 pro looks so beautiful specially in black it reminds me of iphone 5 black so beautiful 
"Honestly i am getting bored of these sitting only tech videos
MrMobile Micheal Fisher does these tech videos best The background is changing frequently and he is also outdoor most of the time
 He change the tone frequently In here one take audio and its kinda getting boring"
Preordered one on the 10th but its coming on the 11th October cant wait but done dirty 
Im glad my first iPhone is going to be the 14 Pro Max
Compare with 13 pro camera in on paper
6mins Early 
gotta use two hands
Can we get your merchandise in India Please let me know
Ooh that Space Black colour is sick
I wont buy it
Display burnins incoming
The lonely island
What is the Tesla thing in the back
Am I the only one who prefers the old notifications way instead of these little icons around the cut out There is still a protrusion in the screen content But with this way its even deeper and wider so you see less on the screen
i think the reason the 13 and 14 look similar is cause theyre testing the new notch so they dont wanna change too much so iphone 15 will probably be the phone to get
1425 13 pro
"The UI for the new notch should works perfectly on older iPhones since its nothing to do with the extra few pixels above anyways
Though apple wont make it work LOL"
Well i guess
as always even if people dont like admitting apple actually takes time to make software better even if they are late to the party
Getting mine this friday Cant wait to see what I can create with this phone Im coming from an Iphone 7
Wont u creese the dynamic islandno one seems to be bothered by how it can affect the selfie cam
Whats the wallpaper on your mac
your intro had no right going that hard
021 if you had made this with black font people could have made a screenshot to use it as their look screen wallpaper
With the sim tray gone in US only models I think Apple is hellbent on making future iPhones portless Chances of having a usbc iPhone that supports faster transfer rate via cables and lesser cable clutter seems grim given that newer AirPods Pro 2 also come with lightning port
Dynamic island was already copied from lg
Are we all going to ignore the fact that Marques casually threw his iPhone 14 Pro on the floor Talk about a flex
I think the intro animations deserve 60 FPS at this point Marques
17 seconds into the video and I love it already 
That always on display is trash We just gotta accept even if apple wants to be unique
I love that fucking wallpaper where do I get it
Reachablity is the issue which will restrict people from using Dynamic island and eventually it will smudge the hell out of selfie camera
Can you finally watch a YouTube video in the dynamic island whilst you open another app
great review definitely thinking about upgrading from my old iphone XR lol
"i still hate the huge notch and stupid prices i dont care how fancy it is a phone isnt worth 1000

also i miss the headphone jack and sd slot"
the intro made me fall of my chair 
"No need to copy Samsung has a similar hardwaresoftware concept
Its called EdgeLighting"
iPhone 15 will come in pairs A left and a right one
Probably this years MKBHD most viewed video
I really dont get the hype around the Dynamic islands It is a cool feature but that wont be the main reason for me for buying this phone
Mkbhdapple is back dynamic island is a gimmick
"When will you talk about the iPhone 14 having a 60Hz display
Oh guess you wont cause youre just a biased reviewer
And the dynamic display is only innovative in the eyes of the sheep"
CUNtectivy Marques CUN 
141 whats that Widget at the left side
It would be really great if they introduce some animations on the current notch but apple will always be apple
The intros are just gooooold
Just like iPhone copied the always on display
Put it on a skateboard and crash that into something
You can test the car crash feature by dropping the phone into safety crash tests with dummies
From last 5 years apple making people fools
This overpriced shitty garbage iPhone 14 Pro the price in the Europe will costs at 1450 euro for the base model 128gb lol
Is that island just a notification bar that doesnt go away
Anyone else feel like those cameras will cover the entire back of the phone in 2025 
"Its funny to me how people complained about the reachability of this similar feature in LG V10 and V20 which had smaller screens but are now blown away with Apples implementation which is far harder to reach but prettier

Edit ok seems like this comment got some attention I am not saying I dont like the feature Im saying that its in a tough to reach spot and for that many iPhone fans will come up will all kinds of excuses as to why its useful and whatnot but they also never sat to think about the uses when LG had it they were quick to judge even Marques said it was a struggle to reach back then"
Why is there a brown hue on top of your hair
The dynamic island is such a gimmick to get around the notch
The Dynamic Island is very gimmicky to me Sure you can see your music player in a tap I can see it by swiping my notification bar Really not any easier
Quality content as usual Android user here
That intro OMG  respect
Whats that calendarish lockscreen widget
Of course lagdroids will try and copy it and make a worst version thats what they been doing for the past 10 years
default marques hoodie
The hoodie is fire 
Con eso pago toda mi vida tan caro esa mrd
bro thats Egypt flag on the hoodie 
After watching that bts tiktok from the M2 laptop video every time i see an intro now Im just trying to imagine the arm is and what its doing
I hope you killed that Lanternfly
Is the Dynamic Island be able to turn off 
Thank you so much Marques for explaining and present the product to us  All the best and keep up the great work friend 
Smoothest intro ever Keep up the great work
is this video shot on the new vraptor xl
1322 RIP LG
They should called it Iphone 13S minor changes Waiting for 15 or 16
Im sorry did he just casually drop that phone  
Ngl apple does some things great But this Always On Display is just lame tho 
"5 mins later






Samsung ok so how to we make a punchhole the size of a millimeter into dynamic island"
I was waiting to see how the notifications pop up on the display
Kanye West and JCole Someone has an elite music taste
Wow its a first review about iPhone 14 Pro My congratulations Bro  You first person who released about it in YouTube
16min and 120k views 
"The intro 
Wallpaper please "
Technically HONOR did the whole Dynamic Island thing first but as usual Apple makes it so much better Its somewhat a mixture of marketing gimmick and kinda useful Hopefully the cutout gets smaller in the next phone 
I guess iPhone 14 pro have a lot to be talked about but it seems less talk about because the death of Queen Elizabeth have overshadow it a little bit 
Was waiting for this review
So the copy will be copied yeah ok
iPhone wallpaper link please
The dynamics island is wrong idea The main reason is that Its going to interupt the pleasure of video viewing
So the question is if im coming from an iphone 7 should i purchase the 13 pro or the 14 pro
Ive been waiting for this video
Im sure JerryRig will find a way to test the crash system
So yeah bro umm this feature has already been done with certain apps for android in China Look it up
This vid is on another level trust me 
Gonna need that wallpaper
Whats the point about watching phone review  No matter what a youtuber tells you about a new Android an iphone will anyways be the favorite Even if they tell you that this android is going to be my daily driver or im switching there is always an apple watch on their wrists meaning there is still an iphone in there pocket This gets boring Iphone is the only at the end
15 minutes means Im 618 comments from first 
Worst intro ever from the music to animation everything
Will be the first time apple sets a trend in a while Cant wait for iPhone owners to be smug when it comes to android lol
Born Sinner I see you are a man of culture as well
deamn LG v10 7 years ago we are getting old guyyysss
PillHole still exists its using software to make it look like a pill
This song brings back a lot of memories of old videos xD
The Dynamic Island is way too high to use it with one hand I would love to see a 6months review of that feature and see if people are finding annoying thats on the topspecially small hands people If you think about the new screen lock on iOS16 puts the notifications and the music player on the bottom so why use the top of the screen for interacting with the phone Its good for notifications though
insaaaaane intro
Fire intro the 14 Pro is amazing
"I am very very very very surprised astonished and sad to witness all these surprise about Dynamic Island
It seems that many people are confused this feature is just icon and widget it is a way to beutify the black pill in the middle and the same people dont know or dont remember that other approches were taken years ago from birth of the punch hole screens Maybe with less pompous names than Dynamic Island or maybe on other OSs
In the end I see in this case just a saddly for the future of the human kind great marketing strategy"
"Dynamic Island could be copied by Andriod by just adding a widget  
Personally Dynamic Island is just a gimmick very distracting  Cant even view full movie with that big ass pill of darkness "
Does the AOD timeicons move randomly every few minutes or when locked like it does on for example Samsung Android phones to prevent any possibility of burn in  Being that the iPhones AOD timeicons seems really bright It really should move around on the screen Also you should at least have the option of how transparent the background is so you can make the AOD background fully black if you want
that intro is justwow
unpopular opinion  dynamic island looked so annoying to me it looks even bigger than the notch
"Slightly above the A15
Then proceeds to show the numbers
Sheesh Androids way behind now"
that intro is sick 
iPhone and phones in general are incredibly stale now
304 brush its thick as hell i remember those days when every year apple used to make their phone slimmer and slimmernow its the opposite
They use this gimmick dynamic island just to distract ppl from the outdated ugly notchbig thing stopping me from buying any new iPhone for years smh
Does anyone know that wallpaper download
"Nobody

IPHONE EVERY YEAR"
Your 5g is slow 
All are going gaga over Dynamic Island Many app devs and other devs have targeted interactive elements to the lower half of the screen for easier reachability Why unnecessary hand gymnastics What happened to reachability What about 60Hz on a 800USD phone Are you gonna defend it by saying Ios 60hz is smoother than android 60hz  pure BS this is Double standards why
"Dynamic Island is just Apples answer to Androids Notification Bar You literally get exactly similar info when you pull down the Androids notification bar Apple Just did it without you having to pull it down 
The Engineers probably got inspired by the usefulness of those features in Android and only  Tweaked it a little"
Cool intro cool thumbnail You are the Hamilton of tech tubers
The Dynamic Island is literally a notification pill Its not some revolutionary feature 
So theyre gonna copy Apple copying Samsungs approach The defenses for Apple are amusing lol
They should bring back the micro SD card and the head jack port
Only upgrades are the camera and the dynamic island And as much as I love the dynamic island idea why the fuck should I touch and smudge my cameraand one handed mode when necessary is absolutely useless with that dynamic island cause the stuff is still kn top of your phone which means people with normal and small hands or even slightly larger hands have to use 2 hands even with the small 61 size Not really user friendly dont you think
They should have added a feature or option where u can have the screen off and only the clock and icons of the apps where it has notifications like android It will save a lot of battery
I was here before 10mil views
Best morning ever 14 pro reviews and GR corolla reviews D
that car crash detection app is Great AI shit quality
These intros are getting CRAZY 
That notch is ugly af
If you travel outside US  not able to an esim satellite connectivity might come in handy  Food for thought
the intro music makes me nostalgic
Dynamic island is just apple covering up that big ugly notch
Evergreen intro music 
 235 When he says Im sure some other youtubers will find a way to test it I think he meant Linus 
god tier intro
you mean the intro  yes it will be copied
Is anyone interested to exchange ipun 14 pro with my kidney Pure fresh kidney
I wish they could reduce the price of 14 pro 
Man people act like it 2007 everytime apple releases a iphone that just nowadays copies everything and Android phone did like 5 yrs prior with less functionality and user friendliness via DRM who wouldve ever  thought youd need DRM on a telephone
A great way to test the crash detection feature would be to put the new iPhones into vehicles undergoing crash testing with the IIHS or NCAP
Ew
I can agree with you
2 words Not Impressed
Absolutely bangin intro as always my dude
your video 
Does any iPhone 14 model support wifi 6e Just curious
"This will be copied
LG started  this"
how tf is Yes Graduation listed as popdance 
dope intro Marques
Straight to review No unboxingfirst impression video Marques
On iPhone 13 No update issued yet
Again that island thing proved Apple is more like a marketing company They are really so good at it
God damn intro Superb
Not fair at all that you get to have it but not us
My problem with this phone isnt the functionality of the dynamic island Its how annoying the cutout is to look at in landscape I genuinely think its more distracting than the Notch I dont think I could see myself watching videos with such a big cutout in the display and the fact its separate from the bezel actually makes it more noticeable to me They should have let go of Face ID
931 it reminds me of lg v20 tiny screen on top
Herd segul islend
Daynamic Island BABY
goose was here
The intros dude so good man
Great videos
Marquess where do you get this kind of music Can you please share it thank you
Some dude just made an app for android to copy that Dynamic island
It took several years for Apple to finally implement a compact Low Battery UI
My opinion is that if you own a watch having an always on display is kind of unnecessary specially if you have an Apple Watch
"Dynamic island is amazingly very smooth 
Hardware and software "
where can we find that amazing wallpaper 
I think the Always On display should have the option to have black and white only to preserve battery life or something like just display the time I think most people constantly wake their screen to see the time every like 5 mins or so
Why are you guys creating hype of the dynamic island  Its just a simple thing Not so much useful Because people can easily check all of this through the notification bar 
dose any one have this wallpaper to sent it to me
I can finally afford iphone 7
Ga ngerti abangnya ngomong apa tp tetep di tonton 
Turning a weakness into a positive is an excellent move
You can test the satellite message sending nonemergency if you would like
Dont you think this implementation of alwayson display may lead to burn in Because it is dimming wallpaper and same location of clock
Google Pixel had car crash detection for years
645 MKBHD Listening to Stronger
Dude Beautiful intro Marques I loved it This was the best intro ever  
Hot take but I prefer the android always on display I dont like how it basically looks like I just left the phone on which would bug me
Anyone got that wallpaper  it looks too cold
Its hilarious how when MKBHD zooms into the screen in the intro you hear waves and seagulls because its a dynamic island
"INTRO 

hope well get a bts on the intro "
But I dont really care about any of that tbh speaks volumes thats my reaction to the entire phone
I doubt it will be copied Android phones are moving towards hidden front camera holes
They say that Xiaomi had it already But when looking up info then seems like it happened lately with some software update So Xiaomi fans try to copy Maybe Xiaomi will accept the template
"Copy Android dont need it Its just an animated notification bar on top
And Apple please Don copy Foldable phones in future Stay with your flat phones"
Not buying your hoodie man
I dont know if the song at the top of the video had that seagull sound naturally but if you added that after the fact good on you lol nothing like a seagull island
Was I in a car crash I cant tell oh wait Let me check my iPhone
Holy shit that intro was 
Someone needs to buy my kidney Message me
The eSIM only is devastating for me As I regularly travel to Sudan and back But I do plan to get one from Canada 
The pricing for the iPhone 14 Pro series is Ultra Pro Max Plus for me So forget about buying it out of my own pocket But I would love to get it as a giveaway
His intro is good enough for an advert Ive watched it like 10millon times 
You mean you got to use it earlier than everyone and still get invited to the event when its showing the same thing 
Only apple can not keepup with latest technological advancement and get away with it using software
Been waiting for this review Cant wait to get my hands on mine Friday Between the camera and the dynamic island I think this is going to be a very fun upgrade
214 of course he went to download a To Do List lmao
The car crash detection feature will only call emergency services if the user is unconscious for a set period of time after it detects the crash So this feature shouldnt trigger a SOS call from accidental drop or test
Finally Have been waaaiting for you to release a video on it
Finally upgrading from my iPhone X Cant wait to pick up on Saturday
Poor Andrew lad got ignored
For Dynamic Island you can spend 1500 for the new iPhone Pro or download a theme for already existing Xiaomi phones either way is nearly impossible to use with one hand
305 what about a rollercoaster They have pretty fast deceleration
Only way I see  dynamic island being copied is if manufacturers start moving backwards and start increasing the size of the punch hole cameras  instead of working towards making it under glass and invisible
I will buy the iphone when it comes with usbc
Pixel got crash detection years ago
Props to you and your team for that slick intro animation
Didnt like the Display Transitions Its so different to the usual MKBHD simplicity A slight overkill
the island just seems like a feature that would come on a android phone and id turn it off like if im reaching for that pill its basically the same distance to pull down to see the notifaction tray which has similar funcionality but with more information
Im not really Impressed
Damn i skipped 5 ads on this video
Another great review Thanks mate
A very clean phone and user experience with a best in class camera
Im in Phx I cant wait until we get hoodie season weather lol
It already has been Checkout  Xiaomi MIUI
That intro just 
What an intro  Really love the MKBHD team
Now if only they put USBC on their phones
Looking good
The intro  Other youtuber carier
"Dynamic Iland is a joke Samsung engineers must have seen that and laughed a lot 
Apple why try to hide the black hole on the screen just chuck some functionality around it and put an apple name people will buy it and feel good about it

Come on people no visible physical hole should be on your screen in 2022 Dont let them fool you"
If Steve Jobs daughter doesnt approve neither do I Lol Ill stick with my 13 pro
The smoothness of the animation is what makes the Dynamic Island so appealing They really nailed it
I think the dynamic island is just a singular gimmicky feature they needed to push people to potentially upgrade  other than that its a really boring iPhone Its been the same the last 3 years and to charge people full price on a new iPhone for the same processor as last year is criminal we all know iPhone bionic chips are the most powerful on the market  we all know it does a great job at picture and video processing  we all know the battery life is better what have they really given the consumer Reliability I guess Contentment I guess for the average person its okay but from a tech standpoint Apple has lost its innovation a long time ago I love anything tech but you have to admit Samsung has been doing amazing things lately  Their foldables arent really my thing but I did have the z fold 4 for a few days and it really cant be explained unless you hold one and use it However I am returning it and sticking with my S22 ultra This may be the year apple loses customers to Samsung surprisingly
Damn 22 minutes
Man Apple is so good at making the best of an inconvenience But to me its still an inconvenience Still a black bar at the top of the display
"You cant beat the notch use the notch

Whoever came up with this deserves a raise"
Love the video To me that camera bump is horrendous
My wifi is down dont wnna watch it in 1080p with my phone data will be back soon
Won out early Normal not till after Friday not Wednesday night here in Australia
Apple  Clown World
Im just curious how crash detection would work on a roller coaster
WAllpaper link pelase
At 022 is that support rod supposed to be there or an  editing mistake
"This AOD is a gimmick I know I wont get it on my 13P but Im actually relieved
Ill gladly take Samsungs AOD over Apples any day"
What an introamazing
Ah another piece of tech Ill never own 
We all have been waiting for this If you have comment here Good job by the way
Do a video analysis on their ads They dont even advertise what it can do
Lol Im turning off Always On Display immediately its such a dumb feature I have an Apple Watch there are clocks on my computer and on the walls I dont really need my phones battery to unnecessarily drain
How does the satellite connection compare to the recent Tmobile  Starlink announcement
If the dynamic island ever comes to a new version of the iphone se Id buy it in a heartbeat
I love the Dynamic island and its usefulness
Dropping that IPhone and my heart skipped a beat 
Cmon Apple  lets update the notches to dynamic notch  its software right 
Watching this video even though I know I cant afford this 
That intro looked soooooo good Like that just Wowed me
That friggin intro Omg
Luv it i wish i have iPhone
I believe some YouTuber will actually tries to have a car crash just to test the crash detection
I think the fact that we have to interact the front facing camera area is very weird and noApple like Coming from someone with oily skin and smudgy screen all the time
Im waiting for the iPhone 15
They gave us satellite connection but no usb c 
Trying to live up to apple event quality Amazing work I wonder how you guys still manage to keep the excitement at events and do speculations and all that
Gosh the iPhone 14 trailer is much worse that your video preview
intro was dope
Bro I never expected this review to be so soon
mkbhd makes better videos than Apple themselves
Texting in the middle of the ocean because of satellite I see you 
"Just fluke action
Not revolution 
I miss Jobs"
That intro was aesthetics personified 
Gets the silicon upgrade dude you are talking like Apple exec clowns now please stop
The best thing about the iPhone 14 is that the 13 used market price is much more affordable now  Great review as always
I honestly would find an always on display to be annoying more than helpful Id feel like Im wasting battery Good that you can turn it off
people fail to realize that its still going to be obtrusive in landscape mode it looks amazing in portrait but in landscape what will they do just add borders to it dynamic island is kinda overrated and with phones evolving having cameras underneath the display people will get tired of this feature quickly
It has already been copied by Xiaomi
What about on a rollercoaster for the car crash feature
Wow You are killing it Keep up the great work
Love the seagulls sound when showing the Dynamic Island in the intro  
It IS copied
Hey Marques hope your knee is okay
305 they said in the keynote that it uses the barometer to detect a big pressure difference due to an airbag explosion I doubt falling hard will trigger that unless you also have an explosive fart
They may CoPy the bit of multitasking or switching capability by just adding similar switchable notification toggles on the status bar but hopefully they dont start adding a giant island on clean looking all screen flagship android phones
i just want 50 thumps up for this
Would be interesting if a crash detector would activate in an extreme rollercoaster
Can I pls have your other phone the 13 pro please
My Apple Watch Series 5 called emergency services the other day while I was Go Karting and someone ran into the back of me So a real crash I guessbut thats meant to be Fall Detection not Crash Detection
My gold 14 pro max comes on friday Cant wait
For me the car crash detection is cool but Im a roller coaster enthusiast and ride roller coasters all the time And I dont want it triggering every time I ride a roller coaster lol because your traveling at high speeds your moving loud noise and stopping suddenly when the ride is over I hope apple tested that lol
I really want apple to add something like Dynamic Notch for all the iphones  it could be done through a software update though
I think you can use the Satellite message even when youre not in an emergency Like when you are out on a hike and want to share your location with someone even though you have no signal
The flex with the intros are getting out of hand D
Oh I dunno let the team strand their boss on a desert island and see how the satellite works Id def watch that Lol Jk
Will It Cost Screen Burn in From AOD I Know From Samsung AOD It Shift Every Few Minutes
I think its fair to say while there are many other review channels nobody can do a review of smartphones better than MKBHD
That bezel looks straight out of 2012
Hy alll 
The corners look rounder
"Cant wait till I pick up my iPhone 14 on Friday 
PRO MAX DEEP PURPLE 1TB

Im giving my previous iPhone to my mother and the previous iPhone I gave her to my father  ITs hand me downs  but it allows me to keep track of the 1600 Im shelling out every 2 years

Apples buyback isnt enough money to justify the return 

Every single phone from the XS MAX till now is good enough for my retired barelycomputerliterate parents"
I couldnt see this being worth it unless its a free upgrade
I already know Ill be back to watch this again based on that incredible intro
Dynamic island is just a glorified notification notch
If a movie fall was made after iPhone 14 released 
where IMEI is located since theres no sim tray
These early tester reviews never really reveal anything meaningful
"Enough Leave some coolness to others too 
AMAZING as hell that intro"
"iPhones add more complications every time and android remove complications every time

iPhones are so complicated nowits not the grandma phone anymore"
The dynamic island is nothing but a gimmick People are praising it because of apples genius marketing video during the announcement This will get tiring in a month and everyone will go back to hating the island It still takes up a lot of unnecessary screen space
That intro song is such a throwback to 20172018 Good times 
"Until Android at least Galaxy flagships decid to fix the uploaded media quality to social media apps my next phone will definitely be an iPhone
Its tempting more than ever"
Maybe a roller coaster might trigger the accident detection
Whats the point in having a punchole when the bottom of it rests basically at the same place the notch did
Oh man same intro as the iphone X from 5 years ago 
Is the space black actually darker than graphite
FUCK YOUTUBE for CENSORING MY COMMENT
Always on display done by nokia 10 yrs ago
Android user will surely be fuming when android makers start copying the dynamic island
How can I get that beautiful wallpaper used in the video
its already done 
Loved to hear this old intro song from 2019s MKBHD videos 
Nice review I hear you saying the word clutch a lot  Thats pretty clutch lets stick to dope  Thank you  
The workout thing happens with walking all the time for me as a European living in a walkable city
How dystopian is that car crash detect feature Americans are somehow OK with the 35000 deaths a year attributed to car accidents
Gotta love Marquees its nice too see someone stick on his own values
the title emerging is so cool
That intro is as smooth as dynamic island
I want to use iphone 14 pro but i have not money buy it so i waiting it low price 
They removed the default lightdark wallpapers in iOS 16 and thats the thing I didnt like
Lets take a minute to appreciate that into 
"Many people havent realized that dynamic island is apples answer to Androids Notifcation Bar Its very very similar to the GlanceInfo you get in the notification top Only that you have to pull down to look at the Stopwatch music player voice recording screen recording etc info 
Apple did it without you having to pull down the bar thats the only difference Nothing innovative"
Marques didnt even bother reviewing the fold and flip 4 because theyre too similar to last year No problem with the iphones basically being the same for 3 years now although the dynamic island is pretty cool NGL
Interested to see if any roller coasters could set off crash detection
The Dynamic Island is tempting but Im gonna hold out until USBC next year
Been a minute since Ive been this EARLY Im so proud of myself  Nice review as always MKBHD 
Never clicked so fast
The production quality and the intro was honestly incredible
Flossy Carter will love the always on display 
Isnt it funny how YouTubers stopped doing drop tests when new phones come out Thats soooo 10s
Drive off a cliff in my ford escape
The seagull sounds for the dynamic island animation in the intro was neat
Others will do it with a smaller notch and it will look even better
Marques Brownlee has been consistently great at what he does over the years Hes very passionate when talking about the advancements of technology in todays society The newest iPhone release seems cool I feel as though it doesnt differ too much from all the other past iPhones Maybe the top notch has been replaced with Dynamic Island at the top that allows users to be more flexible with the device theyre handling or using
I really hope people dont copy that big xss  It looks ridiculous Its about as bad the hr not google gave us one year Hard pass Keeping the 13 Pro Max or will upgrade from Apple to Samsung eventually Apple is the New Google I left Android because all the damn animation and the push for customizability Apple makes phones to try and keep up with Samsung now A shame
its cool but still silly a gimmick that could be on any iPhone that has face id but apple fans will eat this crap up
The intro sums it up all for the differences from previous generation
None of the android features or models gets a this will be copied tagline but APPLE FANBOY just had to say it
Yeah there watching everything you do now
"me on rollercoaster
IPhone 14 911 whats your emergency "
Am I the only one who thinks the intro was a little pixelated
Casually dropped iPhone and kept on talking
So far for me the 14 pro suits its price
Ima do it like an island boy 
"APPLE FAR MORE BEHIND THAN ANDROID IN INNOVATION
 STILL WORKING WITH OLD PEACE OF SHT TIM LIKE  THIS IS THE BEST I PHONE EVER "
Did youforget to paint out the rig in the intro At 018 seconds
Amazing intro Also noticed that when you showed dynamic island in intro there was bird sound on background That detailing 
Why am I watching the things I cant afford Ooh I have remembered its coz I can now afford those that came out 5 years ago
Biased review
Android and Apple showcase their attempts to hide the notch Android is putting actual display overtop of it while Apple is hiding it in plain sight with the Dynamic Island Credit where credit is due the Dynamic Island achieves this solution in a flashy manner but that notchpunch hole is still there and is quite large
apple
Time fliesI still remember the time when the iPhone 5 was the way to go
I had to replay the intro omg its so good
542 That pill notch just makes it look like a cheap android phone here especially with the thickish bezels imo
Apple needs to go back to its core as invention company not to keep selling the same product over and over by changing the name 
Black or deep purple Im torn What yall getting
Those Opening Graphics are Incredible
I WANT TO SEE YOU REVIEW THE APPLE WATCH ULTRA
Damn the intros of Mkbhd videos now a days are so sick
The new intros are SICKKK man
THAT INTRO THO
who was the dude who said marques should use the pill to spell out iPhone
Dope intro You guys should make iPhone commercial someday 
308 accurate representation of how my ex treated me P
was waiting for your review the last few days 
My notifactions just went bonkers with everyone dropping The Iphone 14 vids at the same time 
Ill miss the green
Hello Marques will you be reviewing the Xperia 5 IV
Im early
these intros are always amazing
No one cares about the island Why did you shit on the Pixel 6a for having 60hz but didnt say anything about the iPhone 14 with 60hz Bias maybe
Pill can be copied but animations can be
Was just wondering when hes gonna drop the review 
Whoa That intro is iPhone 14 Pro worthy 
030 is that supposed to be there   dont matter still awesome
We dont want copies We want the notches to go away as fast as possible I wasnt hopeful when ZTE did it cause its not a very famous company but when Samsung started doing it in the fold I breathed again
Pleasd dont copy that dumb as shit dynamic island Apple being pathetic with these features
He is completed soldout himself
What is that calendar widget on the Lock Screen
early gang
Grimgor Ironhide will Wreck all
"S22 camera seems better especially telescope lens 
Also 48 Mega picx is just gimmick same like google phone doing "
Intro was dope
Next year the camera hump will cover the entire upper half of the back 
The intros keep getting better n yea that dynamic island is awesome
I got to unsubscribe from your alerts Ill remain a subscriber though I hope everything is okay I think a video everyday is a bit much
Apple needs to release their own international phone plane for traveling You sign up with Apple pay on a weekly basis and pay something like 20week and they handle deals with local cell providers to get you service wherever you go
THAT INTRO IS MAD HARD
I love this phone but I cant buy it 
Maybe Adam can test the car crash mode Just a thought
yeah nice but still almost 200g brick
I am disappointed that Apple has not provided USB C type charger
That intro is on par with apples ads for their phones prolly even better The team outdone themselves again 
Im a Pixel fanboy but I am definitely getting an iPhone 14 Pro
The ios 16 looks absolutely spot on and I love the new lock screen 
Worlds gonna make another island so dirty 
sick intro as always
just wait for the androids now  
Awesome phone to upgrade from iphone 8plus
I have had it for about 2 months now Incoming Hehehe  great content
You mean android will be copied
This shit qont be copied i am sure aside some cheap chinese knockoffs
Can we download your wallpaper somewhere
Excited to get mine in hand
NICE SONG CHOice
the best notch ever
Tee it up like a golf ball and smack it with a golf club That should trigger the crash sensor jerryrigeverything 
Woooooo
"Credit where due

Apple just made the worst part of the iPhone the best eyecatching part"
Finally th iPhone feels a little bit different from the previous gen Kinda sucks that its the only pro line up but still
StreamersVloggers that I follow are concerned about the esim
Editing is on another level 
Android just wont quit copying Apple will they
bro that intro was fire
Why are all iPhone 14 reviews out on the same time from all tech vloggers
Enough time has passed I need it
Literally was about to go to sleep and the Maestro drops the hottest review Guess whos calling in sick tomorrow
100 points to the commentor that predicted theyd use the dynamic island in the opening animation
Yeah ofcourse it will be copied Thats the only thing Android manufacturers do copy Apple When will they start copying Apples innovatives AOD
That info is 
Bigg fan from West Bengal India 
wild intro
Eagerly waiting finally notification come
Ferst geve me phone i desrve an award7
Just what I have been waiting for Also 20 minutes 
Jeez These intros get better day by day
Can already feel that this will be the smoothest phone ever made Thanks to the animations and perfection in execution of the pill shaped notch
The iPhone 14 looks really good 
will dynamic island leave burn in or is that rare
The 48MP advertisement is just that break it down the phone still takes similar quality photos as last years iPhones
"The new notch looks great and its cool dat they are utilizing it to help with some multitasking Im curious to how ui elements would look on the 14 pro

I was wondering when Apple would do it since the samsung s10 5g did dat style of notch in 2019 which also has a 3d face scanner"
I loooovvee Apple  Apple is the best I must say 
Madd Intro 
Best video intro this year
What widget is he using on the Lock Screen  The one with the dots
Who can realize that he used the same background music from Iphone X Unboxing video of his channel 
someone in the comment section called this intro a few weeks ago im wondering if the team saw it 
So sad for the people who buy this shit just for tiktok
Dynamic Island is a sober inventioncover up as legend says humans cannot multi task will eat into the value in the long term
Love From Pakistan 
the transition though
WOOOHOOOO
Apple always get the software right although I agree this is such a minor change compared to last years 13 I think the fluidity and well integrated uses of the new island still makes it a worthwhile upgrade
Apple find a way to keep notch for 3 to 5 years with island Dumb iphone fans already obsessed with same 
2019 mkbhd vibes songs
Is a flop compared to the years before
ahh  lets go 
Haha that reminders app short gag
Why always uploading the same time with Mr whos the boss 
omg the intro is so nicee
Loved the intro of the video Like your team also can say Its been a week we had the iPhone 14 pro
Im gonna be very honest love the review but the crash detection is the most useless feature
Its not really an update
Could you create a video where you compare the new iphone not only to the 13 but also to the 12 the Xs etc These phones usually last a couple years so when people upgrade theyll probably upgrade a few editions And the comparisons between all these versions is usually not very much talked about
"Android Manufactures especially Samsung with their Bottom OneHanded Ui approach with the One Ui will probably adopt this Dynamic Island feature IN THE NAVIGATION Bar Thats perfect and better than being at the top because you can reach it with one hand Duh They just need some tweaks There might be a Bar at the bottom that displays extra Continuous info kinda like how Spotify shows you what musics being played with you minimize the player

i Really hope andy does it better with this opportunity"
1300 euro here in Europe No thanks
I hope so
Dynamic notch wouldnt have sounded as ridiculous  patent pending
Horrid
Android OEMs would introduce back the notch just to copy dynamic island feature 
Im a bit phobic of the pill
DAMN That intro 
I was here for GO PRO Hero 11 at this perticular time
First one to watch from Kenya
thanks
So Ive been using this phone since last year
technically no one has finished watching the video yet 
Samsung is better than iphone
"The intro went from Oh thats neat to Damn like Damn
Props to the team"
Awesome job marquee I m enjoying the iOS 16 a lot 1010
Insane intro once again The production quality is 
you could use one of your robots on the car stop the running car and make the robot imitate a crash motion to test crash detection
How much longer before Type C
Jesus 200 comments already
When do you think think all screen front will happen
"so they made the hole punch useful while also making it seem settle overtime 

respect to apple for doing that"
The software development investment is too much for anyone besides big companies to copy
THAT INTRO 
Why does his camera work looks better than my mirror
Android has always displayed notifications and useful info At the top of the screen so there is really no need to do what Apple is doing now
How are there so many comments already the videos only 5 minutes old and 22 minutes long
lets goo was waiting for this video 
been waiting for the embargo to end this will probably be your most viewed video ever
Its here 
The amount of tech vids I have watched about things that I cant afford is insane
Nice camera work as always nice
MKBHD THE BEST
No matter how much I try to get onboard with switching to Apple I just cant do it Idk I guess I just like feeling like Im in control rather than just having something thats user friendly lol
Did every YouTuber decide to upload iPhone 14  14 Pro vids at the same time lol
The fact that Apple wants its products especially iphone to be easily recognizable is a big limitation of theirs
Nda
First unbox of the iPhone 14 pro
There is an app called Edge mask on android it has been available for 3 years Its definitely iPhone that copied the idea from android
First
show us some videos about router and tplinkdlink wifi6
He and Arun uploaded iphone 14 video at the same time
I havent been this hyped since I got my iPhone X 5 years ago Finally upgrading and Friday cant come sooner
4444
Wow nice b roll
Look at this intro dude stunning

DUDE THIS INTRO 
Wow the intro is certified fire 
The first iphone 14 pro review thnx MKBHD
Dynamic Intro 
first
Cleanestintro as always
This could eaily be done on the 13pro too I dont appreciate when they isolate software on the latest hw
dope intro bro
Best review from best youtuber
1k
the intro is fire
It has copied also
Your review will be copied
Can you like calm down with that smooth AF intros
It wont be copied because the hole design was available about three years ago
i think reachebility will be huge factor for dynamic continent because its not island and people wont use this feature very often
012 Those seagull sounds to represent the dynamic island Nice touch
Better animations and intro than apple for sure
Very nice But price in Europe 
Video so smooth its like butter
That classic MKBHD intro music
I love apple but dynamic island is gimmicky we want proper multitasking
Marques knows how to sell an iPhone better than Apple does
iphone 14 content coming out like rapid fire rn
iPhone is the best phone you can buy despite the minimal and impractical enhancements introduced now Nonetheless using it is an enjoyment Like Fuji cameras in the photography world
Iphone
"I just want to hear it from you Marques 
Your reaction to iPhone 14 is important "
Bring back the old school MKBHD intro bangers for this one
I cant wait to see it in person
Simply stunning
ayy man keep up the good work
Among the first 1000 likes
Marquess Intro is Far better than Apples
Worlds  best  YouTuber
Rolex avva Peru Dilli 
Dynamic island is cool but it feels like 3D touch Its just filler until the notch is completely gone
YESS
Lmao lets gooo
i got an iPill early from some guy in an alley made me swallow it tho for some reason i dont feel so good
That intro my gawd
early gang 
My favorite Youtube channel
The intro is simply prodigious Chefs kisses
Hoooly cow That Smooth Intro

For 1 thousand dollars its pretty good even though there arent any major or flashyupgrades
I am 2 min early 
Man that dynamic island is so smooth I want to go there
Do yall plan and do it or guys comment your thoughts idk why Im wanting to know lol or does the brand tell them a certain time to post
welcome to 2016 apple
Lol he used the top comment intro
This phone has literally broken down all the records a way ahead of its timeGG
Nice to Hear This Tune After iPhone X
Been waiting on this all week 
013 seagulls hehe get it Because of DyNaAmIicC IsSlLaaAnndD
The dynamic island was definitely the staple of this years September event
This intro song has separate fanbase  from iphone X to iphone 14 pro 
shhhessshhh  ngl wish i started to earn to get this beauty
116
Markus my men
Only iPhones get the sick intros I swear 
Marques never disappoints D
That intro almost convinced my to buy this phone
I was waiting for this review thank you MKBHD team 
Been waiting for this I am seriously considering getting the 14 PRO down the line  Never purchased a premium phone in my life before
finally
im pretty sure it wont be copied No one wants an excuse for a literal WHOLE in their display anymore Even more so now that apple wants to normalize this just for some fancy way of displaying notifications Lets be serious now
Copy the lack of ingenuity perhaps
"I have an iPhone 11

Should I get the 13 Pro or 14 Pro Seems basically the same but 300 cheaper to get the 13"
BRO SO HE DID HAVE THE IPHONE 14 FOR 8 MONTHS NOW
Intro was clean
Its interesting because Android seems to be focussing more on getting rid of the notch I dont know if it makes sense to copy apple or not its a very apple thing the dynamic island
So is it good 
Tell that to samsung and co as well as their flock who enjoy mocking apple and yet every time their favorite company ends up copying them
MKB240p
The dynamic island is actually the smartest way of getting around the cutout issue completely unexpected and pleasantly surprising I would never have come up with it myself
How do mr boss and mkbhd post at the same time  So weird
I need mine haha can UPS deliver early please
Can we talk about this amazing intro 
A great example of waiting to make something that actually works well instead of just trying to be the first
That intro video was smooth asf did you guys make that
