So the U1 has been superseded by the Secondgeneration Ultra Wideband chip Thats quite the mouthful shame the crack marketing team couldnt think of a shorter name
" iPhone 15 is rated for the same battery life as iPhone 15

quality reporting right there"
Did they say matte finish on the back Thats new for the base models
"Is it still USB 2

Edit yep appears to be The pros have 10 gigabit USB 32 gen 2"
13 mini gang gang
Cool that they brought the dynamic island to the non pro phones
I missed it Still 60Hz
I cant find a reasons to upgrade its the same pretty much
Wish it was 120 or 90 hz otherwise looks very nice so far IMO
Now after they forced us we are introducing the all new USBC port and we think you are going to love it
Standard iphones were the star of the show this year
Complete confirmation that weve moved into the era of I need a new iPhone because mine is dying from I need a new iphone because the new one is so much cooler
Ive watched these since the original iphone I can safely say this was an absolute snooze fest
YESSS MATTE FINALLY
They kept on mentioning siri I was expecting them to unveil a new version using chat GPT level AI but nope just an easier way to tell siri on your apple watch to set the timer again
" Dynamic island

 48MP Quad Bayer main cam

 Slightly updated design with rounded edges Looks like they just hit the whole phone with sandpaper

 New wideband chip for longer range

 USB C at USB 20 speeds lol

 Some new random pastel colors


Otherwise more or less identical to the iPhone 14 Same price as it too Same processor as last years pro 14 no new design no faster screen just quality of life updates 

Phones have matured and stagnated and as a result it is kinda boring But its understandable I suppose 

Its arguable theyre creating pretty artificial price barriers between the pro and regular models now though Used to get the latest chip Now only the pro gets the latest Would be a piece of cake to add USB 3 or at least 90hz refresh but nope only pro gets those Can we put a button on the phone Nope Custom buttons are pro features TiTaNiUM oOoOO ahhh is cool I guess Some slightly better cameras Anyway I guess thats the most annoying part of it"

They really had a segment reintroducing the A16 for a second time Couldve just reused the clip from last year and dub in iphone 15 over iPhone 14 pro
Honestly liked the iphone 15 better than 15 pro
Maybe its time to upgrade from my iPhone 8
What kinda blue is that 
2023 and still a 60Hz display on a 800 iPhone
Did they mention USBC yet
weve reached the point where new colors is on the headline dont even know what to say
Do the cameras on the back stick out the same as the 14 Pro or worse Did they say and I missed it
The one engineer goes usbc capabilities have been built in to Apple products for years 
Where is the Product Red
Couldnt be more underwhelming of a keynote
My only wish was for them to bump up the standard iCloud 5GB storage At least it should be 5 per iPhone one has purchased Definitely left disappointed again
Event sounded so fake and all recorded Miss the live versions
"Currently on an iPhone 11 Watched the keynote and the 15pro didnt speak to me at all

Should I get the 14pro or the 15 base Photography is only a hobby for me wont be gaming or watching movies

Thanks"
This is the first year I have absolutely no desire for the pro phone I have an iPhone 12 Pro and this regular has all the features from last years pro that I wanted
love how they predictably acted like usbc was some engineering decision to bring the best port to the phone
The colours are so underwhelming on the base models
Me WHERES MAH PRODUCT RED
im so tempted to get that pink phone
A 60hz smartphone in 2023 almost 2024 
Apart from the camera whats really a significant difference between base model and Pro
I think Apple is running out of ideas
No Promotion 120hz is lame af Whenever I use my wifes phone it feels basic 
This is really one of the most boring Keynotes ever hahah
Knew I shouldve waited one more year for USBC  I have an iPhone 14 Pro
So nothing new really
Could this be the year I upgrade my X Maybe I guess IDK Who cares They are all the same
As usual they can go fuck themselves with 60hz screen in 2023
IPhone 13 mini my beloved
Bummer that unlocked iPhones can no longer take advantage of the Apple Card 12 month payment plan
I still find the idea of Dynamic Island a wonder in marketing even for Apple having a hole in your screen to put the standard front facing camera and then put notifications around it to disguise it and then give that a name and market it as a super innovative and amazing feature that gets listed first as the reason to buy it is beyond me
60hz only Cmon Apple seriously
"60hz on a 1000 phone in 2023 is a joke

Complete deal breaker"
f16 pretty good
Why not white
Do we know if ant faster charging Was reading something about 35 instead of 27
This may be the most marginal update Ive ever seen
"USBC to lighting adaptor 29

USBC cable 29

HOW DOES THAT ALIGN WITH ALL THAT GREENWASHING APPLE  Make the adaptors cheap FFS"
wow that was BORING
Havent watched the event yet did they call it a USBC port or come up with a proprietary name like they did with 120hz
They are really limiting the speed of the USB C on the base model for pretty much no reason why so much greed I bet they will have to introduce this on the 16 base model or the EU will force them to
"So mad they got rid of product red

Colors are really disappointing this year

Who is going to buy that garbage yellow and green off color

Iphone colors peaked with the iphone 13 imo

httpspreviewredditj9errqs9evnb1jpegwidth3920formatpjpgautowebps1b69cacdf8e21c8112b7450f00effe3c3e5dfab2"
I really like the new colors wish the Pro line had half the pigment
Mother Nature thing was cringe AF
iPhone 15  iPhone 14USBC
Colors are a miss prob saving the sweet colors for the Pro
It it had for hz I would have considered the 14 pro to the 15 14 is too heavy
Does ANYONE know if the thinner Bezels are only noticeable on the pros or on the regular ones too I desperately need to know please
"Some nice additions but not enough of an upgrade over my 14 Pro 

Ill wait to see what they do next year"
Im pretty interested in them adding the metal upscaling and putting games like RE village on the iPhonevery awesome
I have the 13Pro but honestly the 15Pro doesnt offer enough features to justify that Ill be happy with the base 15 or maybe 15 Plus it packs enough features to justify the change
its just a 14 with usb c port 
"I really didnt mind the lightning port I havent syncd data over wire to my phones for 5 years or so Its held up to lots of abuse too 

Lets hope the usbc port is robust and not crappy like an HP laptop

Will be nice to have a new standard As soon as Android decides find something better apple will be behind again though"
"In my country Finland the prices are as follows

 15 128Gb 989 1062usd
 15 256Gb 1119 1200usd
 15 512Gb 1369 1470usd

 15 Pro Max 512Gb 1749 1877usd
 15 Pro Max 1Tb 1999 2146usd"
I thought Id hate the green but now its the colour I like the most Still wish they had a white option 
Spoiler alert Nothing new
Not even surprised they announced the usb c regular capability on the pro model like its an innovation so the rumor about the regular model at 20 usb speed is true
"I watched this hoping there was more 

Is that it"
Very meh year Nothing overly new or innovated Just incremental improvements
Dynamic Island is nice but these colors suck Im kind of bummed cuz I was planning to buy one next year when the price drops
Does this model have OLED Dynamic Island without an OLED level display may look wonky
my GF was waiting to upgrade her phone for this How does this impact the iPhone 13 and 14 prices Shes looking to not spend over 700 for a new phone She doesnt need the new fancy anything Preferably though shed have the wide camera angle Any advice
Yep well thats defintely a new iPhone First of all its got a bigger number thats for sure
Am I alone in thinking that the default size of the notch would be smaller For some reason I assumed that by incorporating the dynamic island feature that they could bring the front camera elements closer together without it looking odd or imbalanced After all my Pixel has a single punchout notch for the front camera  not sure why I thought that but I assumed the core components would take up less space in the newer models
Anyone hear anything about Dolby Atmos or DTS
" iPhone 15 is rated for the same battery life as iPhone 15

Yeah I can see that"
Boooring Plus still no apple watch to ipad compatibility Even though the interface would already support it
No pink pro Pros always with the boring colors 
Least enticing yeartoyear upgrade I can remember Ill sick with my 14 Pro
Im using a iPhone 11 and so far nothing apple has announced has made me wanna upgrade the only times I really upgrade is when my contract runs out or my battery has degraded to the point its annoying me like the usb c is a great thing to finally have but thats it the only thing from apple so far after all these years is the A17 chip being able to run console  PC games and handle ray tracing which seems extremely good
"The 60hz refresh irks me Give us 90hz on the base model the pro can get 120hz I dont care

I dont want to buy the pro just for the refresh rate"
I dont need a new iPhone but that pink is awesome 
"Putting AV1 decoder behind the Pro models means AV1 adoption will continue to lag because the phone most people buy cant decode it

I understand that like USB2 speeds this is a case of reusing the A17 but uhhhhh what I see is that the A17 is a bit of a quickly outdated generation that they needed to move away from ASAP"
I need to ask people immersed into iPhones Is this dynamic island actually cool To me it looks like frankly a quite huge waste of space in the shape of a black oval on your phone screen And the info it displays can literally go anywhere else be it the dropdown menu or even just status bar at the top
I was a little confused in the keynote did they mention that youll soon be able to charge the Apple Watch and Airpods from your iPhone
Running a 13 pro and I see very little reason to upgrade this year Especially with the price of  everything  skyrocketing I can wait another year or two
I dont think I have any interest in upgrading my iphone in the near future  they are just fooling the public with no or little advancement in their tech  they just play with marketing to sell those 
Yay maybe the dynamic island will get devs doing stuff now
Yes every news outlet has let us know
deleted
Another year the normal iphone let me down When am I going to try an iphone if the android counterparts are always advanced Goddamn apple a 60hz screen REALLY for that amount of money
All the 14 colors are kinda ugly imo excluding the usual black
Still only x2 optical zoom Ouch
"799 seems fair for the 128GB Base Model Most people that took good care of their old Iphone can also trade it in for a discount

But it does feel like we are hitting a ceiling in how much a new Iphone can be improved The Dynamic Island is great and all but whats next"
"Oh Kuo

One day youll get the pro price correct"
Regular iPhone 15 it is for me Not sure wether to choose the blue or black I like some lively color so i will probably take blue
Cant believe how many of you give a shit about screen refresh rate on the base model Just digging for things to complain about
There not being a white iPhone 15 is very surprising
Reddit comments in an alternate universe where they release a 120hz model Only a 12 hour battery life Are they insane
HOLY CRAP 48 MP
so funny how they make USBC the next big thing why didnt they change AGES ago when EU forced them to do so they waited til the last second to add it in lame
I cant wait for all those Lightning cables to go to the landfill
"USBC has been built into Apple products for years 

Sure but 

Also funny how quick the USBC segment ended you know a feature that will affect every current iPhone owner but lets just rush through it in 20 seconds"
The ceramic display protection sounds good 
Does that mean that Android chargers will now be able to charge iPhones
"same price

upgraded camera

TypeC

60hz

typeC 20

128gb base storage and not 256only Pro Max

last year A16 SoC

Once again the more expensive Pro models are the ones to getmore exciting devices Apple holding back the regular models feels really bad"
Advertising the 5G in the bentogrid was kinda embarrassing tbh
No news on battery life no news of the front camera For a pro user this really isnt worth upgrading to I work in construction and I really care about the battery life Disappointing
Will be upgrading my wife and mines 12 Pros and series 3 Apple Watches to 15 Pro Maxs and a series 9 and Ultra 2 watch respectively
They needed USBC years ago on their iPhones Its a good thing the EU made them do it because its a great port way better than Lightning and offers better compatibility Now millions of lightning cables are gonna be tossed
Nothing about this phone is impressive
Weve done the bare minimum including a port change that was forced by the EU So yes we are brave and revolutionary
You know they ran out of ideas when they start with Dynamic Island something they introduced last year
Lol same phone just a usb c port
I have the 11 pro max and i wanted to upgrade to the 15 pro max but theyre the same thing 
Wished the SE4 wouldve been released today Anyone knows when its out btw
hope they under sell like they did with the 14 and 14 plus 900 phone with only 60hz is an absolute con Low refresh OLED displays can cause massive amounts of eye strain Look up  PWM and see how many people complain about this The 120hz on IPhones makes it a lot more tolerable and they refuse to bring it to 900 devices when 200 budget phones have had it since 2019 Wtf is this Either buy pro or just go with android
No WiFi 6e 
I have to pay 1200 buy all new accessories and all I get is a neat new color on my phone Where do I sign up
Still no finger print reader My office doesnt allow face unlock
Underwhelming Glad I went for a Z Fold 5 but I cant wait to go back to iOS once they decide to innovate
Pro Max made out of titanium yeeaaaah its going to cost a bomb
Looks cool but Dynamic Island with 60Hz will be ugly
Damn no White or silver this year I was okay with them dropping Gold but not my beloved Silver 
So should I keep my 14 pro
Not seeing a reason to upgrade from my 12 Pro Max
Why dont they make a phone that actually competes with S23 Ultra
60HZ refreshrate for the cheap ones Ridiculous
2000 CAD including tax for the entry level iPhone 15 pro max Is this a joke Thats 80mo on a 2year term 
lmaooo paying 800 for USB 2 couldnt be me
"From the product page it seems the nonpros do not support Apple Pro Raw  Kind of a deal breaker for me bc I just cant stand the awful postprocessing Apple does although I hear its better on iOS 17

Bummer that such a basic but important featuee is locked behind a 200 price tag"
About time Apple went Universal with their accessories
"Tossing my opinion in here I honestly think there isnt much reason to go Pro this year

For a Max user like myself I could care less about the slightly smaller bezels slightly more optical zoom base models now finally have 2x zoom and transfer speeds

The only noteworthy thing is that you only get 60Hz on base which honestly is something I dont want to REWARD Apple with spending more on the Pro for 400 Android phones get 90Hz adaptive screens at this point

Base models now get the nice frosted back finish they weigh much less you save 300 compared to the Pro Max and they tend to retain their value better"
I just want a red iPhone man
any rumors on European pricing 300Eur again
Obviously just my opinion but Im thoroughly underwhelmed I was primed for an upgrade on my iPhone 12 but Ill hold out another year now
8gb ram hopefully
If the iPhone 15 pro max came in pink I would switch from my fold 3 Its so pretty Than you have samsung not making a pink 23 ultra National tragedy
Pink looks like shit
I find it extremely funny and ironic how apple removed a feature under the guise of  courage only to end up with a wired headphones option years later via an inferior interface and being unable to charge while listening to music
What will happen to CarPlay My car doesnt have USB C ports Will there be USB A to USB C cables
Excited about the USBC port has anyone stated yet whether it will support external independent displays like Mseries iPads do  I assume not but hoping for some improved functionality there on that various peripherals or transfer speeds it supports
No 120hz is a joke
About time But wont there be restrictions on compatibility with 3rd party USBC cables Thus defeating the purpose of one of the most appealing aspects of moving USBC being able to charge with cables that are used for any other device
Why cant I get pretty colors with the pro
Still no Touch ID  Im stuck with an iPhone SE until they bring Touch ID to another phone
" 

RAM RAM RAM

Do we know officially confirmed and real how much does iPhone 15 Pro Max has 6gb or 8gb

no theory only facts thank you"
Just got the battery replaced in my iPhone XR Watching this keynote made me feel good about that decision
"RE Resolution I was on the Samsung forums when they announced 120hz resolutions It became full of UGH THIS IS AWFUL IT LOOKS SO WEIRD comments and ways to turn it off 

Just because a minority wants something doesnt mean the majority does BUT I feel until it comes it will be the most requested affair especially now that USBC and 32 for some models is now available"
For the first time apple had to market their phones Mentioning we can trade older iphone for credits Recession is really here
Thank you Europe
I noticed on the product page they advertise Optical Zoom of 4x for the base and up to 10x for the ProumApple doesnt seem to know what optical zoom means
Apple stock is down 25 today for a reason
Loving those colours
USB C finally lol Pixel user
"Can anyone explain to me whether I will be able to connect a iPhone 15 to an ARZOPA portable monitor with a SINGLE USBC cable and achieve the following 

1 Charge the internal battery 
2 Mirror the iPhone screen 
3 Play video successfully
4 With audio coming through internal speakers 

Im sorry if I post this in more than one thread today but I really need to find out for work reasons

Help and advice will be greatly appreciated

Also Would it make a difference if I bought standard or pro models"
USB 2 and missing Promotion in 15 Too expensive for what I would get for my requirements
60hz 
WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU GETTING RID OF THE SILENT MODE SWITCH
"Wow This keynote blew me away with their innovation 

How are you guys coping   It is going to be tough to decide whether to fork out 2k for a Blue  iphone 15 Pro Max or buy a new blue case"
Anybody know the charging wattage of the usbc port
I still remember all the reports that itll get USBC but only 20 speeds and everyone was all pitchforks and torches
supports usb 2 feels like they are mocking the customers
Yawn
I swear she said in the keynote the battery lasts even longer but all the specs are the same as last year
Seeing the new 15 basic variant makes me wonder how theyre gonna price the 14 pros now 14 pro suddenly became so desirable for me If I can get the same phone with an extra lidar sensor for the same price I think 14 pro wins over the 15
wait a minute and i just realized this was on the 14 too how did they jump from 12 megapixel cameras to 48 that seems suspicious that would be more megapixels than my DSLR how is that possible
I have the iphone 14 pro max currently  the camera is horrible half the time would trading in this phone for a PINK iphone 15 help that orrrrr
"So why isnt satellite up in the headline isnt that a biggie

i15

usb2 over usbc nonotch colors and better local tracking what about lidar thats still just on pro still 60hz 1600 nits with 2k boost

so

nonotch and colors"
"Lmao and the same thing yet again this year

Cant wait to get the HUAWEI P60 and have satellite calling capabilities GO CHINA"
The downfall of Apple The whole point of the iPhone is that its ecosystem is different from the rest of the phones The main reason young people buy iPhones is because they will be bullied or feel pressure if they dont By making this change its the start of a slippery slope where you are allowing compatibility with other companies If they ever change the blue bubbles to green that is the nail in the coffin
No iPhone 15 plus bummer
I wonder if they did anything about the battery 14 Pro battery is atrocious at best
I hate usb c ports They feel flimsywobbly compared to lightning port and I have a few devices where they cant be charged anymore because the port is messed up
"Everyone shoveling out their money for an iphone 14 with usbc 

"
"Anyone catch that the non pro 15s technically have farther zoom range than the 15 pro non max model Since the main on the 15 was upped to 48mp it can digital zoom to a 12mp equivalent at 4x while the 15 pro is a 3x at 12mp lens 

Even with optical zoomdigital zoom the main sensors are much better with details in low light You can test this now if you have a 14 promax With the way the zoom is automated across the 3 cameras you are stuck with 29x as the max crop zoom on the main 48mp since it switches to the 12mp tele at 3x 29x on the 48mp sometimes looks better and more detailed vs 3x on the telephoto 

Considering the 15 doesnt have a telephoto all zoom is done on the new 48mp sensor which gives you farther range at higher resolutions than the 15 pro telephoto would 8x at 6mp equivalent on the 15 would be only 6x at 6mp on the 15 pro Am I crazy or does this kind of make sense"
So there is no Red Colour option
So should I upgrade my iPhone 12 Or my wifes iPhone 8
theyre the best iPhones weve ever made well no shit I would hope so
I literally took a nap during this event
Give us 120hz in the 15 you cowards
Which color do the 15 pro max is gonna be the most in demand
So were the color matching braided cables confirmed They looked white in the event
Time to switch brands
How big is the sensor of the main camera of iphone 15 pro max
How can you immediately preorder
So the 15 Plus is literally a 14 Pro Max but with USBC and without ProMotion and Always On display
Why was nothing mentioned about charging speeds of the 15 pro
Still no orange 
What are the storage options on the base model Considering giving iphone a try
"I havent watched it but is there any news about ESIM changes

USA had esim only iphones right Have they made more regions ESIM only"
When I preorder should I get it delivered to my house or get it in store Im not planning on trading in phones but I want to transfer everything from my old iPhone to the new one Is it easy to transfer everything on my own or should I go to store
Time to switch to honor magic v2
lol
Do we know the full list of 40 countries in the first wave 
I like the yellow of the iPhone 14 more the 15 is too bright
Does the titanium shell make the screen more shatterresistant
Will it have a sim slot
"Pretty much a meh show   24MP final images is a first as far as Im aware in phones using 48MP sensors   So that could be nice   But the zoom is nothing special   The Max in general is a really hard sell

Anyone know if the new ultrawide camera is in both pro models    I assume the base model sees no upgrade there"
Im running a 128gb 12 mini with 84 battery capacity  Debating whether its worth it to cave on this to have a phone that doesnt require charging 2x a day 23 hours of average usage a day  Ill miss the form factor of the mini trade in is at least 195 still somehow
can Iphone Max 14 Pro cases fit on the iphone 15 pro max Design seems the same and the it has the same display size
Ive been waiting for mint green to come backcrazy the whole 15 line is pastel then the black phone lol
Any android converts care to share their experience This is actually pretty tempting to me for once
"So can you tell if the mute button is on by feeling it in your pocket or a dark movie theater

For me that was one of the advantages of a physical button"
Interested in seeing how the battery life will be
That pink is feral Fresh graze
Im going from Android to the 15 Plus
Are iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 pro cameras the same besides the zoom range
They got the pro under 226 grams Nice work Apple
If I upgrade my 11 its going to be for the pink 15 purely because it is pink I loved my rose gold 6s
None of the features would really make a customer buy this phone The days of revolutionary ideas or design are behind us it seems
Theres just too much I hate about this The fact that that USBC port is actually official the fact that all those colors are as bland as the color selection before it That distracting as heck Dynamic Island The bloody USBC port And dont get me started on them replacing the mute switch with the stupid Action Button Theres hardly anything here that I would consider to be actually good overall Especially with eSIM still being a forced implementation here
Im surprised they already gave it 48 MP but still no 120 HZ
Yes my 14 pro is here to stay at least 5 years
Whats interesting is its 50 euros cheaper than the iPhone 14 when it launched
"iPhone 15 is rated for the same battery life as iPhone 15

Wow so good to know that

Edit Damn someone beat me to it "
The 15 lineup this year looks really good Ive been using my Xs for the last 5years and this looks like a solid upgrade from a pro model from a couple years ago
Base IPhone is the new SE 
Lmao get USBC still has the same speed as a Lighthing Lmao cant be more obvious that is just a we have to change this port because the law makes me but you still get stuck with our shit speed GG Apple GG
"Apple officially transitioned to USBC in its phones and AirPods ProMax  and going forward probably all other products as well Yay

However the regular iPhone 15 will only support USB 20 480 MBits and not 31 10 GBits like the pro

I think thats quite disappointing and I dont see a reason for this limitation  it seems rather artificial Is it really just to get people to buy the pro I mean were talking about a 20 year old standard 20 30 was specified 15 years ago For a premium phone like the iPhone that sells for a premium price of 1000 Id expected at least 30

What do you think Justified Stupid

To be clear I think the 15 is a great phone but its also a little disappointing to finally have USBC but with the limitations of 20 I guess charging speed is also a little disappointing but thats not necessarily because of the 2031issue"
Really bored with this upgrade cycle but my 12 cant hold its battery anymore and is in really poor shape The colours available this year are really bland wheres the Product Red accessories
Did they say anything about the always on display being on the base models
It feels like the weakest sales pitch for jumping to a Pro model ever
Why are they pro and pro max always so ugly compared to the normal and plus  I want pink sooooo bad but I refuse to downgrade my cameras and pay more
Usb4 is a thing and apple chooses to use usb2  Lol ok
Man the colors are surely a let down
Where is the red edition this year
"Idk why everyone is complaining with how underwhelming this keynote was Yes weve reached a point where were plateauing with phones and thats ok You dont need to upgrade every year or 2 years or even 3 years 

The iOS updates are more interesting and honestly have always been more interesting imo But the iterative updates on the hardware are perfectly fine My gf for example has an iPhone 8 and is going to be upgrading The 15 is such a massive upgrade Imagine coming from that to this phone"
Meh such a disappointment The only innovation is the EU forcing apple to use a standard port The event sucked big time
U2 was taken lol
I wonder why iPhone Precision Finding on Apple Watch is limited to the Series 9 with U2 Watches as old as Series 6 have the U1 and the U1 chip works just fine on iPhones when locating AirPods Pro 2 There really has not been anything that the U1 on Apple Watch has been used for and now a feature that it should support is being kept only for the newer version
Facts are facts
Hey with the state of journalism these days getting 100 accurate facts is a win
It makes sense two iPhone 15 should be rated for the same battery life  because they are the same phone
its not about being accurate its about being first
Rtechnicallythetruth

rSixtySecondsInAfrica
The iphone rumorleak niche is the worst Its a mad rush to throw everything against the wall and see what sticks And then when the broke clocks happen to strike right they act like gods
Vulcan reporting at its best
Im confused I swear she says in the keynote that the batteries last even longer but they all have exactly the same life as the 14s
"This might actually be correct on a technicality Not sure what the product code for the new iPhones are but the 14 Pro and Max are actually IDd as iPhone152 and 153

httpseverymaccomultimatemaclookupsearchkeywordsiPhone152C2"

Technically correct isnt it
"Also
 Portrait mode will now also be automatically enabled automatically when shooting"
A plane is plane Are you saying a plane is not a plane  Ryan George
1 iPhone  1 iPhone
The back glass is colorful instead of clear this time too Its subtle but judging by photos and videos its a really beautiful effect
The crowd goes mild Just consume take my 25k please
USB 3 speed is a headline feature for the Pro models so yeah Id have to guess that the standard 15 still communicates at USB2 speed
But why does it really matter  I havent transferred anything from my phone via cable in years
"So let me see if I understand thistheyve put the fastest cpu and GPU ever seen in a mobile phone a 3nm groundbreaking lithography process to create their CPUs but in 2023 they cant even enable 40gbps for USBC which is 3 years old at least  

Ill take a bet that next year its iPhone 16 at 20gbps followed by the iPhone range at 20gbps and then the iPhone 18 at 40gbps when Samsung introduces it in 2024"
Yeah and the Pros come with a USB 2 cable since they dont even seem to sell USB 3 cables The iPhone 15 Pro specs page has a footnote near the USB speed that says USB 3 cable required Hilarious
god that is ridiculous the apple way
Its a bit childish for Apple to limit speeds to 480 Mbps even the lowly iPad mini at 500 does 5 Gbps  The silicon on the A16 already supports higher speeds
i thought someone here said they arent allowed to do this per EU law Unless that means iphone 16 will make them all USB3 and theyre just doing it for one year
"How many regular iPhone users even use the cable to transfer data nowadays 

Its probably literally just 3

Im exaggerating of course

Far more important to get high data speeds to the pro max

Which they did"
Im gonna throw up
No only 30 not 32 says the official apple site
12 mini gang here
Unless the create a smaller footprint phone Im keeping my mini
They have brought most of the pro features to the base models the year after although thats really only been a thing for a few years
"They basically have to if they want it fully adopted   


Not worth the development time for apps to support it if only a fragment of users can use it long term"
Trickle down technology 
Its a side grade at most I personally hate it Its an ugly gaping hole in the screen In certain apps like Maps the screen above and around the hole is all blurred which means less usable screen than the notch version
Theyre gearing up for underscreen cameras for the pros in a few years
Did they announce any new features for Dynamic Island Curious how theyre adopting it as a signature iPhone quirk
I would have prefered them having a 120hz of the 13 pro and a notch compared to 60hz and dynamic isle
Im honestly a bit surprised I guess if they want to make the island a core part of the OS design they were better off bringing it down sooner rather than later
"Its a dealbreaker for me Ill never buy anything that has a botched forced into the screen I do art and watch movies on my devices Im not working around their annoyance

Guess my SE soldiers on"
Besides reiterating it has the super retina XDR display they didnt mention it had a higher refresh rate or anything so its still at 60Hz in 2023
Yep looks like Ill be buying a refurbished 13 pro 680 to replace my iphone 8
Yes
For the regular or pro
Same they made this one easy on me Looks like Im waiting till the next round
I feel the same and I have a 12PM I know this is the wrong post but also the 15PM feels no different to me
"I have a SE2 and I dont see a reason to upgrade

Kind of getting sad that they put that less innovative into the iPhone these days"
Im stuck with the iPhone 12 Mini and waiting for the same form factor hoping that itll be the SE with USBC I dont want to be forced to a larger phone
Yeah a bit sad I dont even want 60Hz I want the variable rate that goes down to 10Hz I swear I notice the difference in eye strain
90hz would be such a fitting mediumlevel upgrade to go along w USBC
So does the extra hz really make a difference
99 of people cant tell the difference Its not happening
Guess what
Pro version of the phone is 120hz with ability to play console games which is pretty decent although more expensive of course
Looks very boring
Didnt you hear theyve been doing it for YEARS
And its part of Apple for years 
"Can someone explain to me specifically and clearly why you think this is only happening because they were forced The EU regulations are not in effect They could make another phone with Lightning if they wanted to Theyre making the change now because they committed using Lightning for 10 years which ended this year

There are so many dipshit antiApple narratives that crumble under the slightest scrutiny like they are literally and objectively not being forced to do this right now and yet yall just endlessly repeat them"
Apple would have had this ready before the ruling They didnt start designing the iPhone 15 the day after the 14 was announced
But we are keeping the same speed cant have you get all spoiled and shit
Beside some political beef hows TypeC bringing anything new to the table
You watched a different presentation I take it One taking place in your mind
Yea that got me a good laugh 
And now they dont need to ship it with a cable anymore
Even on the airpods I just bought mine fuck me
Data transfer feeds are faster than ever using this 10 year old technology youre welcome
I 100 agree with you The standard versions seem to be the better deal
Not really still on 60hz
The new chip though
Absolutely correct
"To be fair iPhones go through a couple of releases that are only slightly iterative

If you look back through the generations this was very true

1 3G 3GS

4 4S

55C 5S SE

6 6s 78 se2

X11

1215"
"New paint on a car Now comes with an air freshener Voila 

Sadly some people will line up because common sense and logic is a trait not teachable"
i need one so i can get rid of lightning cables once and for all
"I dont really see how the iPhone 15 is cooler though 

For me this was the most underwhelming Keynote ever The 15 is basically a iPhone 14 with the dynamic island and USBC"
Thats basically the iPhone X onwards
but its carbon neutral
And midnight is gone thankfully
Too early  that would be announced at a WWDC not at the iPhone event
I wasnt expecting any kind of ChatGPT level AI to be honest LLMs just got big this year so its way too early in development for Apple to implement such things in the user experience ChatGPT itself is still in beta I think within the year 2025 is the best case scenario until we see LLMs utilised in any capacity on IOS
" No new processor

I mean its not new in an absolute sense but the A16 is new to the nonPro models"
So no 120Hz screen
The vast majority of users arent going to care about the USB 2 transfer speed on the base model Most of them are only going to plug in for charging and their data will sync wirelessly Faster transfer speeds matter more for Pro workflows
They said the USBC would be at 30 speeds with a 30 cable Was that only on the 15 Pro
It has a new design with the rounded edges and matte back glass
Regarding chips  appleTSMC is at capacity with the number of 3nm chips they can produce So having the newest chips exclusive to the pro makes sense in a non anti consumer way as they realistically couldnt handle the production of that many new chips on a non pro model Everything else is a luxury feature imo and wouldnt affect how I use my phone at least except the button wtf
This was cringe worthy
Oh man the amount of fart sniffing in that segment
" literal slave labor to make iphones

See how we are being being environmentally friendly"
hOw wAs tHe wEaThEr cOmInG iN
Fucking woke ass segment
same might be my first non pro since the X
Why
60Hz tho Rather buy a text block and draw frames in it
The matte pastel green and pink are so pretty
This is the most honest comment I agree completely It was a more impressive update for the 15 series than the Pros
Whys that
Is battery any better on Pro compared to standard 15
Yes the pro phones arent good value These ones are the best value for money this year
Great phone
Yeah same
all their colors are so washed out especially green and blue I wish they brought back the blue from the 12
A blue for the people who wanted white 
Its like they deliberately made it ugly so people would opt for the Pro versions
"Pastel days are here again

Im getting iPhone 6s vibes this year"
Me likey
Kind Of Blue  Miles Davis
maybe in 5 years they will raise it to 90hz
I recently made some changes to my girlfriends wfh set up and due to some software glitch one of her monitors is maxing out at 30hz when it was 60 before It is sitting directly next to a monitor that is running at 120hz I even pointed it out to her and had her just move the mouse around on both screens It is glaringly apparent to me yet she cant even tell the difference She represents 99 of users for this phone
The customer who wants a standard iPhone experience doesnt care about refresh rate Apple knows that any customer looking for a higher refresh rate will automatically migrate to the pro model
60Hz USB 2 800
Tbh its the 1 reason to upgrade to the Pro apple knows what theyre doing
Its like a cat going outside  if youve never experienced it you dont care about it
Ive tried other Android and Apple devices with 120hz refresh rate and its not worth the battery hit for me even if its small  Ive never been disappointed with the 60hz panel on an iphone for my use
With USB 2 speeds
60hz is fine on a phone lol
"I literally dont care about 120hz 60 looks fine to me 

If it was 30hz Id be pissed but 60 is fine for my eyes"
Seriously Why in the world can my graphing calculator do 120 Hz but an iPhone only does 60
I thought Dynamic Island needed ProMotion to be fluid
Who cares
The touch sensor is still 120hz so who cares
I might feel embarrassed but I cant tell the difference
It really doesnt matter much on mobile devices
Are you a pro mobile gamer
Why do you need a higher refresh rate
"If 60Hz is a dealbreaker for you dont buy the phone go for one that offers 120Hz

I suspect for most people looking to get an iPhone display refresh is not a top priority"
First 800 phone released since last year Apple event with only 60hz display We know you will love it
I swear to god I never noticed the difference between my iPad Pro and my phones before they got promotion I guess I need to see an old phone vs my 14pro to see if I notice it now but I never once looked at this phone and thought it looked smoother or whatever
Bro doesnt understand how a company works
"You can get 120hz on 300 Android phones

I really wished theyd brought 90hz on the non pro models"
2023 and still USB 20 transfer speeds on the nonpro models as well Ridiculous
"I compared the specs on the 15 Pro with my 13 Pro

Theres a better chip but beyond that barely any change Same camera same pretty much everything"
Just did
"Yup

httpspreviewreddit7ipebbyk5vnb1jpegwidth1024formatpjpgautowebps5f8b9ef6655785a0a4580a9c62ef800bf2579f42"
They will
Yeah i feel like iPhones up to about the 7 had some solid upgrades most years Then the X was the biggest change Since then its been fairly marginal in terms of design and other major features I guess if its not broken dont fix it 
Its the same camera so take a pick
Such a huge bump
Its technically accurate My 2018 iPad Pro has USBC and the first MacBook had it in 2014
"I mean yes 

I get usbc is a hot topic but these comments are actually getting insane"
My MacBook from like 2012 still runs and only has one USBC
I mean to be fair you lightning just uses USB
The opened the whole thing by saying the iPhone 15 had an all new design
that was such a stupid statement Paired with usb2 speeds on the nonpro models this is the biggest joke in this years keynote
Funny and sad The presenters are a bunch of snakes
No red is the only reason I will not buy this
The new Watch did come with a Product Red variant tbf
Couldnt agree more When youre harping on about materials and colours that much youre out of ideas
I wonder if they did it virtual because no audience would applaud for the lackluster innovation
And its all green screen
"Got to say I prefer the recorded versions 

Theyre slicker run faster and more focussed

Also they can get a wider diversity of people presenting

Youve got to imagine that only a small amount of people at Apple can handle the pressure of presenting at a gig like that 

Being English  and thus emotionally repressed  Ive always cringed at the cheering clapping  whooping at Apples pre Covid events Its just embarrassing

Especially when you see journalists in the crowd doing it

So no thanks loving the post 2020 format"
Keynotes havent been live since COVID
"If you only care about photography and the price is right the 14pro might be a better deal The only downside is the lightning cable vs USBC otherwise the 14pro is superior in every other way

Id wait for the price to drop first though"
"15  14Pro minus the promotion screen  


I will probably upgrade my wifes X to a 15 as it already had a screen and batery change but performance has gone down a lot  


She doesnt need the Pro features so the base model will be more than enough for her"
Which to me is weird because they could have done it years ago Its also weird because with Mac apple was the first to go all in on usb c Even to the point of being ridiculed by many But I think they didnt want to lose out on the MFi money Lightening also have some slight technical advantages from a port design since theres not the little male piece inside the female end of the port that increases potential for breakage
This is their MO They make everything sound innovative even though the feature theyre bragging about has been done on Android for years
Its the new colour process
Dont think Ill upgrade until they release another purple one like the iPhone 11 Unfortunately lost mine at six flags so I only have the white 11
They announced it
Best color besides the boring black
""
99 of iPhone owners wont notice nor care
Apple are masters at gatekeeping and pricing
" Always on 120Hz variable refresh rate display 
 A17 Pro processor
 better battery life
 USB C with USB 3 up to 10Gbps
 LiDAR scanner"
120hz screen
All it is anymore is an updated processor and camera
They could just take some of Samsungs Like please take some of Samsungs
I have a theory Apple is purposely not including many android features into their devices so that they can be added in small amounts This means that they wont run out of new features as it seems like many android phones are running out of new features to implement
"it feels basic

Yes that pretty much sums up the entire Apple upsell model"
They threw those on the Pro model promotion and 120 hz
But hey theyre trying to save the planet
Me too But my Airpods also still charge with a lightning cable so Id have to keep that around anyway Im not upgrading both the same year so it is what it is D
Its been circulating around the web but you all have this we have to see it to believe it mentality
If i remember correctly the law about usbc was passed in October 2022 so it was still kinda unsure before that
Rumors have been around for a while now
I agree
I have a 13 pro really wouldve loved a 15 mini
Im hoping the mini becomes the new SE next year
Also 30 more 
I was trying to figure this out before the launch  In old apple products it has the option to do that when putting in cart  For the 15 I dont see that options except for purchasing or starting the Apple Upgrade Program  Im already on the upgrade program but keeping the old phone  Do you happen to know if we buy with the Apple Card full purchase it spreads the payments as an option  Or will that payment option be noted correctly when its actually on sale
Face ID is really good and better than any alternative that just uses a pinhole camera Its also occupying part of the screen where nothing is happening 99 of the time Its a smart UI compromise
Im not in the market for an 800 I watched the presentation to finde out abt the USBC stuff but why would you want high fps on a phone
Thats nuts My s23 was 400 and has I think 120hz
Man my Galaxy A53 5g has 120 Hz What is this iphone And mine isnt even Samsungs flagship series
yep agreed is a deal breaker for me too I would pre order a pink iphone 15 on friday if it had 120hz display I think I will get a used 13 pro instead Literally all I want from a phone is 1 ios 2 120hz display
Right I dont give two craps about the better cameras on the Pro I just wanted a normal iPhone with 120hz display Looks like Ill be waiting for iPhone 20 at this point
Every year they push me more towards Samsung
Its 800
I think your numbers are mixed up  1000 usd for the 15pro which is 120hz  200 more for the pro max
When they finally do decide to do it theyll make it sound so innovative like its something thats never been done before
Xiaomi 11t pro of mine has 120hz Been looking at apple but cant see the benefits
"But important to note that this is a smaller sensor compared to the 14 Pro and 15 Pro 2U vs 24U which means its a little bit worse despite the faster apeture

Also no Apple ProRaw on it either so I think the best we can do is the new super resolution 48mp jpegs heavily processed"
Does the 15 got a better main camera lens than the 15 pro
What does that mean
Pro only
The beauty is USC cables are dirt cheap anywhere
"What Why would they include the cables now when they cut support for that years ago to reduce ewaste

Its not about the cost of the adapters its about the number of adapters produced that go unused or thrown away"
Theyre releasing a huge slew of phones in different colors every year  The greenwashing is strong
"Its normally the connectors on the end that cost the most money Wire is cheap

An adapter is just a very short cable"
Just called it USBC No fancy name
Cant wait for the new and revolutionary Dynamic Port Pro
LightningC Port
"No there are Android phones with 20 as well 

What they cant do is lock the speed unless you use their cable Putting in a slower standard isnt banned unfortunately"
Not defend the choice at all but I cant remember the last time I transferred anything via wire Seems like a complete nonissue
EU has no reason to care the goal of the directive is to reduce ewaste by unifying cabling  chargers
Those cowards need to bring back coral
Colors peaked with 5C IMOhttps9to5maccomwpcontentuploadssites6201508iphone5cpngw1000
Apparently it was announced elsewhere
Cant beat the 12s blue
The stare down with the shakey cam just why Who approved that
Yup thats the whole show folks and on the non pro models they borked it with usb2 data transfer speeds absolute gronks
I swear theyve cycled through every color throughout the years and this comment is always there You guys are never happy
Meanwhile I see people saying the opposite and wanting these colours for the Pro lol They cant make everyone happy no matter what they do
Seriously no white Thats the only color I ever buy
"I actually love the base colors and Im happy theyre not using the Pro ones for the base models the Pro ones are usually like Here take a black version and a couple of different variations

They sometimes have some nice ones like the dark purple on the 14 model but other than that theyre usually super meh"
What the colors are awesome I dig the blue and green a lot
This did not age well 
Idk the Barbie movie just came out all they need is pink
pro only
I think Im in the same boat Id want the 48mp more than the 5x zoom
Youll be going from a 120hz screen to a 60hz screen
Im with you on that I love USBC but its hard to argue that for most people the Lightning connector assuming thats what you meant  if not apologies has done the job ably Its durable doesnt care which way up it goes has a satisfying and sturdy connection and hasnt really had me asking anything more of it at any point Ill be sad to see it go to be honest
i copy songs over from YouTube fairly often and it takes about 15 minutes each time for one song so if that can be quicker Im in
Those prices are slightly higher than in the US per the conversion to USD
RIP Starlight
Removed the mute switch
And its true that absolutely no one that buys a base iPhone will ever care
"Yep

 Super Retina XDR display
61inch diagonal allscreen OLED display
2556by1179pixel resolution at 460 ppi

httpswwwapplecomiphone15specs"
"Well ultrawide hasnt been changed   It has a new coating on the lens and thats it   

Getting a 14 Pro would be the same phone in most ways  But they arent cheap either"
"the dynamic island is not a feature it is an ugly compromise

literal lipstick on a pig"
60 hz screen does not feel pro at all lmao
200 more
But but DYNAMIC ISLAND
Ok
800 for a 60hz phone is not fair
Kind of agree but it is a very expensive base model
its actually  48 mp  4  12MP
"48 MP

Androids have had these for years lmao"
Wait I can shoot 48MP on my iphone 14 pro max already or am I missing something here
They promised to keep lightning for at least 10 years
Previous iPhone models wont just disappear you know
"Those lightning cables will be needed still if your buying the 14 or older

It will be a while before those cables go to the landfill because the phones are still being supported"
theyll last forever still because they are more durable
just get lightning to USBC adapters
Do people want USBC or not I seriously cant tell sometimes
Yeah in the most frustrating way possible Who else remembers MacBooks shopping with only USBC and iPhones shipping with USBA to lightning cables
"I mean what else is there to say 

Its a new standard its on the new iPhone now most Apple products can use the same cable 

I feel like people would be whining if it went on much longer by trying to fluff up why its a good move designwise"
The X  15 will be a huge upgrade If it werent for the IUP Id still rock my iPhone 13 Pro Max
Just gonna use the new button as the switch it replaced
The dynamic island is really neat speaking as a 14 pro user Its certainly just a quality of life thing as opposed to the major feature they market it as but I still have gotten some good use out of it
Please stop calling them Android chargers Theyre iphone chargers now Lol
"https9to5maccom20230912iphone15batteryspecslife

Tldr same battery life ratings as the equivelant 14 models"
You didnt watch the presentation did you
new camera dynamic island satellite installed ceramic protection on the base phone How tf is that the same phone are u retarted
"naahhh nvm ur a child

httpspreviewredditdue14s1w7vnb1pngwidth639formatpngautowebps852b47bca34a27b1b46f3ffcd650c7a9655615b5"
The eye strain means you need to see an optometrist
it is on the pro models showed up at the bottom of the blocks when visualize all features
You dont have to Many people wont bother Usually Apple sells a ton of units regardless
Or you can buy some usb c to lightning plugs that you just add to the end of your lightning cables I have like 5 packs of these that I bought a while back that Ive used to turn all my cables into universal cables or as close to it as I can get
Z Folds break within 1 year   Enjoy your year
Wait what  Pro and Pro Max have a White option 
Absolutely not Complete trash at this point
we are at 15 not 23 and apple doesnt use ultra in their model naming or I understand you wrong
and you can argue the telephoto setup is actually work   3x portraits are useful   You no longer have that since its a fixed 5x zoom  5x and above is rarely useful  Even in national parks we rarely would have a situation where 10x framed a photo well
Pricing went down by 50 euros for base models and 100 for the Pro models httpswwwgsmarenacomappleiphone15promaxpricingusindiagermanyuknews59877php
 MagSafe Charger
You can charge quite fine while listening to music on Bluetooth headphones
Its 2023 get a wireless charger
Are you serious with this question
USB A to USB C cables have been around for like 10 years Ask your android mate and they probably have a spare they can give you from one of their old phones
"From Apple

Probably and overpriced 

There are many third party options out there that will do the job"
its a shitty usb 20 port for the nonpro 15
"The EU specifically mentioned that said regulations are just as illegal as not using USB C at all So while I dont have any proof I doubt it

Although the regular iPhone 15 has only USB 20 so its besides compatibility not much better than lightning Guess USB 30 was too expensive for a 799 phone"
" But wont there be restrictions on compatibility with 3rd party USBC cables 

No"
Why Were you born without a face What a strange thing to say
Doesnt look like thats in the cards
120hz is not a resolution its a refresh rate
Same as every year no need to pretend that youre an expert
FWIW Apples stock always tanks on their keynote days because retail traders all pile in expecting a pump
Its USB 2 its not going to have enough bandwidth for that
They want to get rid of all physical buttons There is always been a war against physical buttons  Eventually the button that is there will be replaced with a soft button
20w and 27w as normal
14 Pro will stop being produced so get it soon
Phones have had 12 MP cameras for years Only Apple have that in a recent flagship for the main shooter
In an Apple thread talking about Huawei Lol Some people are DESPERATE for attention 
There is a 15 Plus
You are weird
wobbly
"Ive had like a dozen android phones that are USB C and never had this happen  From LG Samsung Google OnePlus etc

You ever thought to consider you are handling these phones poorly and beating up the port

They arent indestructible"
I honestly think I got dumber from reading this comment
For a moment there I thought you were asking if you should upgrade your phone or your wife Decisions decisions
Friday

"I dont want to dissuade you from whatever not knowing your home situation but over the past few years there has been a rising trend in theft in transit where all you get is an empty iPhone box This happened to me a while back upgrading my Google Fi service from a Pixel 4 to a Samsung S22 all I got was an empty box Took me about 15 months round and round with FedEx and Google to eventually get Google to ship a 2nd phone me telling them Im not paying 1000 for an empty box and that they know the IMEI and etc information from the stolen phone so they should be able to track where it ended up California somewhere and I was in Colorado so pretty clear I wasnt the thief 

For now on I think Im doing all my purchases in store"
Id totally just get the battery replaced and wait until next year
"technically no   The 15 pro has this years version of the same Sony sensor for the main lens   But in practice you will not be able to tell the difference

Ultrawide remains the same as it was in 1910"
And nobody was happy the last time they gave us U2
Upcoming chip roadmap U3 then U14
U Talkin U2 To Me
Truth is truth
"As Key and Peele always say

Potatoes Potatoes"
Dude thats hilarious
That poor overworked writer forced to use AI to meet his word quota
rfoundthemobileuser
Rneverwrong
Immediately covers with case
Base models are 799
Lol
the downvoting youre getting helps show how fucked our planet is Infinitely and blindly consuming a new phone or any new tech every year is complete insanity especially when the changes are so minimal Im not saying Im above it I get a new phone every 35 years same with a mbp but this many people downvoting you is lame BUY IT UP CAPATILISTIC SHEEP A new phone will help get you laid and spread your genes haha
"USB 3 speed is a headline feature for the Pro models

Jesus lol"
"USB 3 speed is a headline feature for the Pro models so yeah Id have to guess that the standard 15 still communicates at USB2 speed

Im only using the connector for charging so speed is irrelevant for me  Sure higher power delivery of USB 3 might be nice but is not a motivating factor for me"
"The unit price difference between a 10 gigabit and 1 gigabit port is still significant 20 to 32 is a pro feature unfortunately

ETA

My example was bad as it is based on gigabit Ethernet vs 10 gb Ethernet most consumer devices such as routers and laptops are still using 1gb

The cheapest 10Gb router I could find on Amazon was 500

Most recently the M2 Mac Studio and Mini got 10Gb Ethernet where the M1 iMac is using 1Gb"
Asking you hoping im asking someone who can help me why would i as a person care one way or another about the data speed of the usb connection Is this basically only relevant for transferring photovideo to a computer Cant imagine what a normal user would need more speed for Help
Which is against the EU regulation
But the higher speed port cost like 20 cents more why
Because there is no reason not to have it besides making the 15 pro look better by making it a pro only feature
If you wanna transfer 200 gigs of video to your MacBook have a look at speed comparisons
Thats because apple never let you really use the storage
Even then 480mbit is way faster than you think What are you transferring other than photos or music thats so critical you need it done in twenty seconds
I heard I could plug my GoPro into it and edit photos in Photos
I just did today and it took a good while
"And this is pretty much the main reason I havent considered getting an iPhoneyet

Most people say 8k recording and more megapixels are useless for social media and stuff but for many people who record the life of their family and children growing up being able to do that and moving files by just connecting a thunderbolt ssd straight to the phone is huge"
Yes the amount of iPhone users that care about having higher transfer speeds than USB 2 are statistically negligible at best Its an absolutely useless feature to overwhelming majority of people
You got any credible sources supporting that claim Afaik the S23 Ultra has USB 32 Gen 1 and caps out at 5 gigs
The EU legislation only addresses charging specifically USB PD Nothing about data transfer
"The EU says you cant restrict speed

However if the ports they used are usb2 then they are not restricting the speed

Restricting speed will be using a usb30 port but making it run at usb20 speed"
Also the EU law hasnt even taken effect yet The iPhone 17 will be the first iPhone subject to the new EU law
James its Valtteri
It is USB 32 gen 2 USBs confusing name structure for USB 3 is to blame here The 15 pro has a USB 3 10 gigabit link which is the same as USB 31 gen 1 and USB 32 gen 1 Just USB 30 would mean 5 gigabit speeds
More like dead battery gang
But not 120Hz display right
I honestly had no idea
120Hz no arguably the best thing they could bring over
wheres my Lidar
That makes a ton of sense
Thats probably why they did so more developers would take advantage of it now that its standardized across all the models
Oof
Holding into my 13 for another year I guess
Is this for both models Is the pro 60 hz as well
Regular is still 60
Man Im waiting for someone to say I have an iPhone 7 feels no different to me
I have a 12 Pro and even playing on my friends 14 Pro feels like a big leap
I had the 12PM but upgraded to 13PM just because of the refresh rate
I feel the same way as my 12PM is still performing flawlessly  But ive got a choice to make I can get a 15PM this year paid for by my job  Or i can wait a year like I originally wanted to and theres a large chance my job will not pay for a new phone due to company changes on the horizon  I think the choice is clear even if i dont feel like its time yet
Do the Pros have variable refresh rate I dont think I heard them speak about it
That will 100 be in your head lol theres no visible or measurable difference from a still image displayed at 60Hz or 10Hz or any refresh rate for that matter
"Between 60 to 90 Absolutely

From 90 to 120 Personally not that much"
"Completely changes the experience to be honest

I doubt anyone on a 90hz android phone would enjoy going to a 60hz Apple machine"
makes a massive difference I was tight on money last year so sold my iphone for 500 and bought a cheap 200 samsung it has 120hz display and it feels SO much better and smoother Using a 60hz phone now feels like aids I can never go back to 60hz
"To me it does make a difference think PCconsole gaming but in this scenario it doesnt really matter as much on a smartphone Ive been using a used budget Android phone Nokia G400 just to mess around see how the UI feels and have it as a fidget customization device while I can definitely see and feel the smoothness and responsiveness going back to my main phone iPhone XR I can easily live with the trade off

I classify high refresh rates on mobile devices a nice to have rather than a most have but thats just my take I would imagine a large chunk of iPhone users are like me and only really use it as a consumption device where a high refresh rate is cool but not as needed"
Yes I can notice it on my iPad Pro
Absolutely Makes the phone feel much faster and more premium
"Yes We need imessage rcs open
Plz europe"
"Thank you European Union big difference 

This aint about excluding certain countries but more about the fact that so many citizens are AntiEU because they deem it ineffective when in reality theyve managed to force the biggest tech company in the world to their knees haters"
Will be extended to all laptops by 2026 too
Youre welcome I hope you love the cookies youve collected throughout the years
Just wait until a new standard thats much better than USB C comes out and we need to wait on selfinterested out of touch bureaucrats to allow Apple to adopt it This whole precedent is absurd and terrible for innovation and efficiency
Yes I am very excited for my iPhone my AirPods and my Apple Watch to all require different chargers
Yeah and now they wont have to ship it with a cable anymore now that it uses a standard one
They did Macs have USB and some iPads too
I remember when everyone was pitching a fit over the macbook air only having USB C ports lol
TBF I think Apple laptops were iirc first or close to be the very first to put USB in their computers Or maybe it was the first to only do USB besides FireWire
I mean everywhere except phones apple has been essentially leading the pack on USBC so its basically true Its just stupid it took them this long to bring it to the iphone
"Yes thats good Apple was moving this way anyway

Like I get the EU angle but do you people really think apple was going to stay on lightning forever When almost all their other products have moved on"
"People also forget that MagSafe has been a thing for three years

Why is that relevant Because MagSafe being an option makes the transition to USBC less painful if you were relying on MagSafe to charge your phone then you will not need to change your cables right away Also MagSafe has incentivized accessory makers not to rely so much on the Lightning port so that the transition will be less painful for them as well

Im convinced that when they introduced MagSafe Apple was already planning for the switch to USBC"
"Well nobody can unless they are willing to violate their NDA with Apple

But its pretty obvious they didnt want lightning to stick around anyone else remember they had lighting on the iPad Pro for exactly 1 year They saw the writing on the wall years ago they basically relegated lightning to low power devices and made everything else USBC"
Apple does something good like limiting packaging materials to reduce waste Redditor responds by saying its only because they make more money that way its not for the environment Apple comes out in California in favor of right to repair legislation This must be because they lobbied and ruined the legislation Apple is evil Apple switches to USBC like most of reddit wanted This was only because EU forced them I am not a big fan of Tesla but I cant imagine obsessing over every thing they do like antiApple redditors do
"Think about it iPads moved Macs moved iPhones didnt

You can try to cope and say its because of the 10 year commitment but then I ask you is it any better that Apple committed to a port on a phone for over 5 years when there were far better alternatives"
They are going to take effect next year
Apple often says they were already planning to do something a judge or regulator forced them to do mosthilariously when South Korea compelled them to allow thirdparty payment providers on the App Store they turned around and said they do lol  This time they just said they would have to comply with the EUs regulation
Not true Its trivial to factor in some port and assess what Europe wants
Issa joke
My god the fanboys are out in numbers today
How are they any better if theyre an iPhone 13SS
"Yup makes it a no buy What is it with apple and this notion that 120hz is somehow pro 

No other company does this because it is stupid Was hoping I could upgrade from my 13 pro to the normal 15 but no Id rather keep my 120hz than get the stupid dynamic island gimmick"
Until the 7 id argue that the redesign or performance increase gen over gen packed waaay more of a wallop Since the 7 things have definitely cooled off with the exception of maybe the X
After the Iphone X and XS it was 11pro  15 pro No massive changes other than going from curved to blocky sides
Mate the 15 Pro looks 20x better than my 12 Pro
I think the person youre replying to agrees with you but I had to read if several times too But yeah my 12 mini is dying and thats the only reason Im upgrading
Lol we can literally save planet and all we have to do is purchase new iPhones Talk about a win win
Yknow whats better for the environment Keep your current phone Which likely if youre here is fairly new anyway
Well I dont use a case so itll look good without it 
I use the rebel flex which doesnt cover the sides I like the way it looks but I dont seeing fingerprints everywhere 
I would have accepted even an alexa level of AI instead all we have with siri is here is what I found on the web
The free version of ChatGPT is already outdated tech GPT4 is the real deal Apple should easily be able to get something on the level of GPT3 out
Apparently the new autocomplete in iOS17 is based on a GPT algorithm so theyre already starting
"LLMs just got big this year so its way too early in development for Apple to implement such things in the user experience

Why Its already being implemented throughout the Microsoft ecosystem"
Yeah I got that wrong I realized the 14 has the A15 not the A16
omehow peedy creen couldnt make it thi year
"it was not surprising because apple but i most certainly care about the transfer speedas should all users

penny pinching is not cool for any one"
of course but its sort of the teeth grinding fact that apple chooses to do that to create artificial product tiers USB 2 is ancient and no product should be shipping with t but apple does it for their pricing ladder
Yes only Pro gets USB 3 at all At least its 10 gig though
There were so few new features to talk about they had to fill the time slot with something
1010 on the cringeometer
I wouldnt be able to go back to a 60hz screen once youre on 120 you can really start to feel the difference
I agree it would be nice but i swear yall sound crazy talking about it
At least the Pro has a good blue again
I noticed that too I really like the blue on the 13 and 12
Oh yes I love my 12 Pro blue But the blue color on the 15 nonpro looks horrible And tbh the 15 pro blue looks okay but doesnt sell me The 12 Pro blue was perfect Maybe going back to black again sigh
I want the 5C colors
Its Easter colors
Something tells me they went with a pastel color palette because it showed off the new colored glass best
I kinda get the feeling that if they havent given the regular iPhones 90 Hz yet they never will Theyll probably give the regular iPhones 120 Hz displays when the Pros get 180240 Hz
"Yup Whenever I get excited about a new monitor that can push 144hz partner cant tell Cant tell between 60hz and 120hz can SOMETIMES tell between 30hz and 60 cannot tell between 24hz and 30hz

Most of us are nerds and obsess over these things Its fine but it doesnt matter to the large majority

I for one love having 120hz on my iPhone and iPad I feel like its one of those things where once you can notice it its hard to go back"
bingo
Thats crazy lol my wife is not tech savvy at all but she did notice something different on my 13 Pro screen she said it appeared faster
"this is me 

I once compared iphone 13 pro and the regular one side by side and I really had to concentrate to tell the difference"
Hertz dont it
Youre absolutely right here Some people cannot tell the difference my dad is one of those people he literally cannot tell the difference between 60hz and 120hz
Lol I dont even know what all of this means so I guess Im the target audience lol
You really cant tell switching from 60hz to 144hz monitors I switched to a 144hz monitor after years of being stuck on a 60hz monitor and I didnt notice a big difference Sure it was slightly smoother but nothing too crazy You really notice it once you go from 144 hz back down to 60hz Scrolling on 60hz phones feel terrible since I made the switch to a 120hz display on my phone
It mostly depends what you are doing with the screen I once didnt realize I had set my PC monitor to 60hz until I jumped into an FPS game With general desktop usage I didnt notice the mouse was not moving as smoothly Once I switched back to 144hz I could tell the difference on the desktop cursor but that was because I looking for it
"Thats how refresh rate works though You really wont see a difference between 60 and 120 until it clicks When it does 60 feels incredibly slow 30 is even worse 
I litteraly cant play games on 30 because i feel like its all in slow motion"
Similar things happened to me and my dad I recently just used his computer and to my horror found out that his monitor was 4K 30Hz because its cheap and one of the HDMI ports didnt support new HDMI standards I didnt know how it wouldnt have felt like crap maybe it did but he diidnt know how to articulate it
The geeks are going to complain forever But youre correct The people who just want to use their phone throughout the day dont care about refresh rate
99 of people will look at you like  when you mention these kinds of specs to them lol
Bro you could literally say that about any feature The major iphone customer is the one who will just buy that shit for imessage and having the OS they are used to
count me in the dont care about refresh rate group
That is such a suck up excuse
"Man you can say the same about pretty much any feature they put in an iPhone The average customer doesnt care about insane performance or bionic engine or that the camera this year takes slightly better photos in low light yet they keep adding all these things

Most consumers would probably still notice a difference between 60fps or 120fps though just like they will notice all the above changes they supposedly dont care about They might not understand exactly why but one device will feel smoother than the other And thats the sort of thing Apple sells 

The only reason why the base iPhone still is 60hz is because its a major selling feature to get people to buy the Pro Simple as that"
Standard iPhone experience is a device thats smooth while operating it Which a higher refresh rate will contribute to the smoothness
"The customer who wants a standard iPhone experience doesnt care have a choice about refresh rate

FTFY


You cant claim that someone doesnt want something when he is not getting offered that something"
well yeah but the competition baseline phones offer better
Yeah I bet the percentage of people who have an iPhone who even know what a refresh rate is is surprisingly low
True but like come on at least give us 90hz
My wife is very smart and has an iPhone 13 and I guarantee she doesnt even know what the term refresh rate means Its just not something she cares about at all
"The customer will feel their phone is faster with a higher refresh rate guaranteed

Theyre cutting corners to maximize profit dont say this  is customer driven lol"
When there are midrange Androids with 120Hz for half the price theres really no excuse not to put 120Hz in the 15 It makes a noticeable difference to how smooth and snappy the phone feels
"the average consumer doesnt care

they also dont care about retina displays or OLED displays or the taptic engine or the more powerful cpu or the hundreds of other features they dont care about

solid logic"
The refresh rate is the most noticeable aspect of a phone especially once someones gotten used to a higher rate they cant go back Thered be a good portion of people for which its the only pro feature they care about
BS They are doing that so theres a step between the models They make the cheaper one worse on purpose Pro has a better screen is a pretty good way to separate them Also only a blind person cant immediately tell that the 120Hz just looks better
While this is true the standard iPhone customer would definitely care more about 120hz than 70 of the features mentioned today
what is this logic
Some geeks are thrifty
"My friend got an iPhone 13 Pro Max and I asked her what she thought of the 120hz pro motion and she looked at me like I had two heads I showed her the difference between 60 and 120 and she told me she didnt see a difference  Cant tell if she was trolling or didnt care  I asked why she got the 13 pro max and she said because of the larger size it offered 

This was before the iPhone 14 launch but it just shows people dont care about refresh rate"
" The customer who wants a standard iPhone experience doesnt care about refresh rate Apple knows that any customer looking for a higher refresh rate will automatically migrate to the pro model

Absolutely Im a programmer and a gamer I work on a gaming laptop with a 144hz display yet Im more than happy with my basic iPhone SE It has the latest version of iOS home button with Touch ID 5G connectivity A15 chip and it was 430 unlocked without a carrier contract or lockin

Im not a professional photographer nor do I take that many photosvideos anyway The cameras on it work just fine for my needs

Lastly I have roughly 16GB free out of the 64GB which includes all the photos videos I took in the last 8 years all of my recent podcasts a few TV shows a couple of movies and whatever people sent me in messaging applications

When they refresh to A16A17 and implement USBC in 23 years Ill probably consider upgrading then but Im more than happy with what I have until then"
They dont care because they dont know any better because they never get to experience it Its a feedback loop
I agree but i am on the fence now about not having a pro model phone because all the feature i want are on the 15 but the kicker is it does not have that refresh rate which is disappointing
"Its actually going to make me migrate down to the iPhone SE 4 when that eventually comes out assuming it has an oled screen so its not like its a one way street to the pro models

If Im not getting barely premium features at 800 I might as well drop down and pay the least amount possible Better camera  10 faster CPU "
Once you use a high refresh rate screen be it laptop or phone or whatever you will care about it and you cant go back And its 2023 they should give higher refresh rate on base models too Even the cheap Androids have minimum of 90hz display these days
Apple is a premium brand They should be stepping up to deliver a premium experience regardless of what we think a customer cares about There is no tradeoff for a VRR 120hz capable screen
"Fixed it

Apple knows that it can sell whatever at 800 price point with not a single premium feature"
It feels cheap to leave out a feature that budget android phones had in 2019 for 800
Hooray for anticonsumer behavior
Most 120hz phones do have an option to switch to 60hz if you really care about the extra battery life Though im not sure how much of a difference it even makes Has anyone run any tests to document the difference
All phones that have 120hz let you toggle down to 60hz optionally and via battery saving mode My phone battery lasts well over a day regardless so 120hz would just be all positives
USB2 speed on an 800 phone in 2023 is just hilarious Wireless file transfer will probably be faster on a good network
"iPhone 15 uses last years A16 Bionic SOC which doesnt have the circuitry for USB 3 speeds I dont think the average iPhone user transfers data over a wired connection often or at all anymore so the reality is most people wont really care or notice 

People who really do need or want the faster USB 3 speeds can get the iPhone 15 Pro Hopefully next year the iPhone 16 will get this years A17 Pro chip which does have circuitry for faster speeds"
Not for that price
Not on an 800 phone
After you experience 120hz its hard to go back Ill be hanging onto my 13 Pro until they pry it from my cold dead hands or until it no longer has iOS support lol
"970 price tag aint fine though lol 

Seriously many Android phones of half the market are rocking a 120hz display 

Keep defending Apple on this like its OK to ask premium prices yet not deliver premium quality"
60 hz on an 800 dollar phone is not lol
but i am certain many people care about battery life and promotion increases it because it can throttle the refresh rate down Most timethings people do on phone isare static screen frames so it increases battery
Because your graphing calculator doesnt have GPS modem graphics card 17 other significantly harder things to do things to do Did you really think you have a point
No one but nerds
I wonder if its USB 2 speeds The pro version feature grid specifically mentions USB3
Ok just making sure my stream isnt like 2 minutes behind
They should probably go to a 2 year cycle no S versions in between
Best way to make money Apple is no longer focusing on innovation but on stability because thats what sells
Steve Jobs did a great disservice to humanity by passing away so soon 
Wait the camera of the normal one is the same as the pro
It is accurate since various Apple products have had USBC for years but isnt the 12inch MacBook from 2015
2012
Apple was one of the first computer manufacturers to add USBC to their laptops In fact they were heavily criticized when they came out with the MacBook Air that only had USBC as no one was using it back then and it basically required a dongle to be useful for most people Now people act like Apples never had a USBC device before How ironic
How is it stupid when it is technically accurate
Red will probably come in the March event
also spent way too much time on the environmental stuff Listen im all for sustainable practices but mention it and talk about your efforts for maybe a minute and move on They made a whole skit about it
"Im sure thats a large reason There is no way it isnt

In person events generate so much more hype than virtual keynotes"
Where
The colors are so muted I wonder if theyre perfecting the process to get Red
"I do care especially when my mothers 2021 Samsung A32 feels faster than my iPhone 11 and it will feel faster than this iPhone 15

x200B

Apple greed"
"Thats not the point

People who are migrating from Android will 10000 notice and care lol

And when you say 99 of iPhone owners its only those who havent ever gotten the pro models for the past phones

They shouldve atleast used a 90hz display"
I just asked  all the iphone users  and 999999  says they care
"Youre wrong 120hz is one of the main selling points of the Pro Without that I bet a siginificantly higher  would chose the base model lower profit margin over the pro

Its greedy marketing torturing exaggerating all these base model users with 60hz just to get some  to switch to the pro"
Also a 3x or 5x telephoto and titanium rails which should be more sturdy
Sweet
Which is honestly all I really care about The screens have looked great ever since they switched to AMOLED or whatever its called
like what
Same Ill only upgrade my iPhone once my AirPods die then I can toss all my lightning cables away 
I didnt say it wasnt clever or maybe useful what I said is that it is a marketing wonder just the fact they named it and named it Dynamic Island which invokes so many things other than just a clever way to show notifications is amazing to me and then keep mentioning it everywhere forefront as if it was an actual big feature
Because budget android phones have been 90hz for years now there is no excuse for apple to not be using it
Why wouldnt you You interact with it incredibly often that it just feels nice
Extremely smooth next time you walk into a phone store use one of the phones on display that have a 120hz screen once you get used to a 120hz phone after using it for a few days going back down to 60hz feels like trash
budget phones from 2019 had 90hz
Beware of the heavy weight Its by far my most unpleasant iPhone experience as its so damn uncomfortable to hold this behemoth in your hand If I could reconsider Id just hold out to whatever you have just a year or two until they run out of options and just slap the 120Hz on the regular iPhones
This mentality is so stupid If it matters that much to you just buy the damn Pro
After how many years is this considered an empty threat
Have fun with that
which is why youre here 
Sure Yet youre still using an iPhone right
800 in the US but he said euros and its more expensive in europe
Wait until you find out that theres places outside the US
Without taxes We are not in the luxury of evading our taxes like Apple
With sales tax its basically 1000
lol what a stupid comment
bro said 
Europe does in fact exist
"No but 120hz makes a huge difference for everyday use too Both scrolling and the home gesture look so much better with 120hz

Besides that Ive used 120hz monitors since 2012 and on my phone since 2020 60hz is just meh"
Aperture is bigger on the base 15 f16 vs f178 but not sure if its better
Its not about the price its about the waste  For Apple to charge the same for an adapter as a new cable is effectively telling users to throw their old cables in the landfill instead of reusing them  Their messaging is wildly inconsistent
I am talking about availability in the store not whats included  I have a ton of lightning cables  Would be nice to just get adapters for them at a reasonable price instead of all new cables and having to toss the old ones
Its not about the unit economics here its about how they spent half the keynote touting their green sensibilities and pricing like this makes it all an absolute joke
Probably patented
The Apple Vision Port C
Its an issue because it tells you how little they think of their costumers the cost for them to have a proper USB C 32 port is negligible
Coral abide with rubicon
"I agree 12s blue was deep rich

I rank the 13 series higher tho because the product red was better than the 12 series"
What do you mean You think its unreasonable for us to want apple to offer 45 different colors across 17 different sizes and configurations of iPhone every single year
Underwhelming colors on the standard model are definitely an upselling strategy at this point At least cancelling the white one is
How do you get offended on a corporations behalf lmao
Just let us be miserable in peace
Were apple enthusiast You should already assume were sadists
I remember when they only came in black and when they started offering it in white people lost their crap
no its just all colors look like very light pastel
I just want a hot Barbie pink
Im one of them lol I just want a pink pro I thought the Barbie trend would make them do it but they only have the lame neutrals for the pros
they could literally just offer all the colours on all the phones
Yeah I hate having to associate with other colors ffs
Thats true 
Thank you 333
Meh its ok I remember when I bought my 13Pro that I noticed that the screen moved faster and more HD somehow but my boyfriend has the base 13 and its ok its not worth the 200usd difference
"Dont fall for the hype of the 120 hz 

It literally takes 45 mins to get used to it in either direction"
I just want one fucking charging cable that can work across the vast majority of the devices My MacBook charges with USBC my iPad USBC my iPhone lightning my AirPods lightning Just give me one universal charger so I can find something different to complain about
I think you are mixing up USB micro with USB C USB C you can connect both ways as well
"yeah but when everything else you own has usb c its just a pain in the dick having this 2nd cable just for the one device throwing my 65w laptop charger in my bag and being confident it can charge all my things is great same with not keeping 2 cables in the car

sure its a first world problem but apple were the literal last holdout here when everyone else got with the program"
You say lightning doesnt care which way up it goes like USBC doesnt do that as well Plus its even better because you can USBC to USBC cables and plug either end into the phone
fuck the lightning cable
Ill admit though that apples usb connections on their iMacs feel way more secure than other manufacturers laptops They have a satisfying click Meanwhile Lenovo and Dell laptops the usb c connection is loose and doesnt inspire confidence I expect the same for the iPhone
As someone with kids no the Lightning connector is not durable
"USBC is all of that plus standardizing the cable I need to carry around Now just my Airpods and Watch have a dedicated cord and they can share it at least 

I never really had an issue with lightning but happy to have one less cable to travel with"
"If they havent stress tested the new port with a group of 8 year olds yet they may be in trouble 

Now to see what Louis Rossman says on YouTube"
That makes sense Faster is better
Yeah honestly that was a bit disappointing
more like people who dont understand technology will ever care thats fine let them deal with slower technology because they dont know better if they used and got used to the faster tech im sure they would appreciate it typical apple selling phones in 2023 with specs from 2008
They wont Its more that apple insults peoples intelligence every year in their events openly Just not fazed anymore but it is annoying
Thats nice to hear Will defs be upgrading to the base 15 from my se2020 The value proposition seems decent aside from the no 120hz
I just checked for th 14 pro on apples website looks like its completely discontinued now Maybe can get a new one in store Is there a 13 pro Maybe Best Buy carries it or something for less wondering if thats a step down in any major way
May as well never get excited for anything then since chances are someone else did it first
and still took worse photos and dont get me started on the video
Pretty sure the S23 Ultra has the new 208MP camera too Apple still takes great photos dont get me wrong but acting like this is revolutionary is dumb
And that could be a concern for some customers My mom needs a new phone and I was telling her about the 15 Shes leaning towards the 14 mostly to avoid buying new cables
I dont plan on upgrading my 14 until I absolutely have to Before the 14 I had the 6S Sometimes I still think about the 6ssuch a great phone 
"They wont all go at the same time obviously

I think I still have one of the oldstyle charger cables around here somewhere"
Thats why He cant wait
Riiiiiiight The pile of bad lightning cables with bad contacts in my office is Mt Everest compared to the bad USBC ones most of which are still using their original USBC cables ipads
What are you doing to those poor things
I do want it myself since have other devices that use it so would make it easier to have one cable but it also would make all my lightning cables useless which feels like a waste
They do but theyre pissed that apple didnt design it so they want to complain
I want usbc that are the only cabels i have i was a full time android user and im going to switch to iphone 15 to test out ios for how long i can Just because of usbc i can now still use one cabel for all my devices and dont need to take a second cable with me
iPhones have shipped with USBC to Lightning cables for 4 years now
Id hope its the same nobody would be happy if its less id say
OK APPLE SHEEP CALM DOWN
"Nothing wrong with my eyes theyre just sensitive

If you wanna read peoples experiences httpsforumsmacrumorscomthreadsanyonewithpwmissuesgettingtheiphone132312292httpsforumsmacrumorscomthreadsanyonewithpwmissuesgettingtheiphone132312292  It affects about 10 of the population"
I see it in the comparisons now Bye bye iPhone X hello 15 Pro Max
Then my experience will be worst than if I just kept my iPhone 14
I usually change phone every year so thats a non issue
Yes I was going off the picture they showcased from the event upon looking at the site it looks way better to the color
no Im saying the Samsung s23 ultra is a lot better for the money than this new iPhone
" on Bluetooth headphones

Yuck no thanks"
Rather be a boomer than pay more for less and worse
Ah yes  wireless chargers that you need to plug into a socket with a wire first
It may not be compatible for CarPlay as I believe you need an official cable for it to work
Some work places dont allow face ID in the buildings for security reasons so all iPhone users have to unlock with pin
What about the pro models which have USB 32
Software buttons are horrible
Thats disappointing I was hoping they would go for faster charging
really apple is clever
and then wait another year probably
"Still remember working in the Apple Store at this time and some old lady was first in line yelling Get this gay shit off my phone

We laughed and directed her to the website Half of us were gay and the album cover wasnt even a gay reference"
curious why was ppl unhappy with the u2
cursed image httpsiimgurcomxNsajadpng
I was
This is very true   Lets force another album download
"Lol yes

Like the SE30

The og macs put X behind model numbers when they released an enhanced models 

When they released the SE however they called it the SE30 instead of the SE X"
This is good rock n roll uhh music
Um yeah I have an advance degree
Hes not American
"Yeah 95 downvotes because Im not a yank Shit hasnt been 799 for an iPhone since I worked in retail over 10 years ago This has to be the dumbest downvote Ive had in my entire time using reddit instead of asking what country just mass downvotes and told Im wrong except Im 100 correct in my country

Have an internationally available website be one of the biggest websites on the world 

Exist and dont be a American Cop 100 downvotes because of it"
Im on a XS my guy Looking to upgrade
That last bit cant NOT be you projecting your hang ups lol
Thankfully USB charging is disconnected from data rates
It looks like the controller is built into the A17 chip and they reused last years chip for the regular iPhone
Its worse than gigabit USB 20 is a maximum theoretical speed of 480Mbps but realistically you usually get half that much at best
its a thousand dollar phone You cant convince me that its that significant
lol pro feature its on nearly every mid to high end android phone
The silicon on the A16 supports far higher speeds see the ipads
Arbitrarily a pro feature
you pretty much got it its useful for transferring files locally whether that be making local backups still a good idea copying photos etc
"No USB 20 should be acceptable for the EU The EU prevents restricting features the parts are rated to not forcing everyone to adopt higher level functionality

In other words you cant block USBPD chargers from 3rd parties if they support the same charging speeds no limiting to 10W when 25W is supported but you can just not rate the port for 32 speeds no cable  host computer gets higher speeds so its equal between Apple and third parties"
how
Its not Apple cant lock faster speeds behind their own cables but there are Android phones with 20 ports too
Is it
Elaborate plz
Its huge for content creators Especially being able to record video directly to external media and use some external devices you couldnt before People dont realize what media creation powerhouses modern smartphones are and this will be a huge unlock for tons of use cases
But if most people arent going to use it anyway why invest the effort time and money into this feature instead of something else that makes the users happy like better cameras or more durable design If majority of customers of this particular device model dont care about cable transfer speeds because its not something they utilize why should Apple put the effort to make it happen
"Nah I sent a few items today via cable and it took so many minutes that I went to eat while it was running

Itd have been near instant with a USB 3 Android from years ago"
"Ive literally never plugged my phone in for data transfer and Id bet Apple has data showing most dont like you say

Its important to some people sure but Apple doesnt really make a thing say 5 of users want a priority

Its unfortunate of course because its a pretty basic thing really  Presumably 10g usb 3 will be on all  iPhone 16 models though like the island is now with the base model getting it"
Then using the same logic they used an absolutely useless feature to the overwhelming majority of people to headline an upper end model
But I demand the fastest possible everything for no particular reason
Why is USB C 30 then in Pro version if no one cares
"Considering the s23u internal storage caps out at 42gbps theres no benefit to having 10gbps usb speeds

The galaxy and note series have been 5gbps since the Note 7 way back in 2016 so theres no excuse for not having at least 5gb on the base iPhone 15 in 2023"
ah I see so as long as they have the same charging speeds
If I may does it matter Like 10gb transfer speeds is pretty fast Unless Im missing something Unless we are talking about straight gen 2 usb in which case apples sucks but its not the end of the world Just wait next year I guess
iphone 16 the law comes in middle of 2024 I believe
But we all know why apple did it now and its because of the EU
"Pretty much I had to upgrade my Series 5 Apple Watch to an Ultra earlier this year to still have access to calls and texts if my phone dies

With the birth of my new daughter and my crappy battery Im half considering upgrading to a 15 Pro Max for battery life and Spacial Video to record memories"
Well there has to be some incentive for the Pros
"I think if youve used a promotion display for any length of time you cant go back 

Conversely if you havent you dont know what youre missing so you dont care

At least thats what Apple is likely betting on"
"before apple added pro motion to their phones id always complain about how aandroids are better because iphone screens only ran at 60hz all my iphone friends kept saying no one needs that regular people cant notice a diffference  


Now apple uses that feature as their MAIN product segmentation incentive for the iphone lineup looks like alota people were able to notice the difference"
Dynamic Island will eventually become an iPhone SE only feature once they finally move FaceID under the display in a few years and get rid of the notch
Is the 15 plus better than the 14 pro max Or are they basically the same now
Why are we pretending that we need 120hz or more on our phones
Good luck it must be scraping by s
Im holding onto my 13 mini because theres no new mini again Sadge
"i think this is the right move i have the 13p myself usbc is obviously early and potentially the iphone16 could have thunderbolt next year

along with potentially better spatial recording for vision pro they are introducing this with the 15p but we dont know how good that actually is"
The pros have ProMotion which has a variable refresh rate of 1hz to 120hz depending on what you are doing Only the pros 13 Pro and above have a high refresh rate The regular iPhones are capped at 60hz refresh rate
Ah but pro is 120 got it Interesting they dont highlight that fact anymore
I have a 11 pro max and miss my 7 a lot I really did not like this iPhone Camera looks fantastic though
"Im using a 7 and its objectively better than any phone made in 2023 in almost every way

Thinner portable onehanded no ridiculous photo overprocessing no notch home button to easily unlock your phone before its even out of your pocket touchid  faceid if using jailbroken tweak metal back so it doesnt shatter when you drop it easily replaceable far more stable iOS version than 16 or 17 long animations able to be turned off using jailbroken tweak saving an hour of wait time every week"
I mean ubenediktleb basically just did lol
In what way
Its time
They do have variable refresh rate from 1hz to 120hz
All Pros since the 13 Pro have 120Hz and Variable refresh rate the 13 Pro went down to 10Hz and the 1415 Pro go down to 1Hz for AlwaysOn Display
Pretty sure I guess I really only cared on the MacBook Pro
Theres measurable difference and thats due to the use of PWMhttpswwwoledinfocompulsewidthmodulationpwmoleddisplays for brightness control The PWM frequency on base iPhones are very lowhttpswwwnotebookchecknetAppleiPhone14smartphonereviewSmallupgradesfortheApplephone6617600html 60Hz sensitive eyes will see the display flickering this can cause eye strains from prolonged use The Pro modelshttpswwwnotebookchecknetAppleiPhone14ProreviewTheApplesmartphoneisreadyfortheisland6595500html and S23 from across the pondhttpswwwnotebookchecknetSamsungGalaxyS23reviewThesmallS23smartphonemakesthebiggestleap7000180html while still utilizing PWM has 4x the frequency so your eyes are much less likely to recognize it
Sure there there are flashes in my eyeballs
Yep There are 2 big noticeable jumps in refresh rates The first is going from 3060hz and its noticeable immediately The next one is 60120hz but isnt nearly as big as 3060hz After 120hz is been shown that youre are diminishing returns category and gets worse the higher you go there after
Im using a 90hz budget android and Im going to replace it with the new 15
Ive been using 144hz display since 2012 and I honestly dont mind 60hz on phones
The human eye cant really notice any higher then something like 23 hz Maybe it makes a difference in how responsive it feels when tapping and swiping etc
"iMessage is not on the EUs gatekeepers listhttpseceuropaeucommissionpresscornerdetailenIP234328 because Europeans dont really use it

The only two messaging apps on that list are WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger"
Its a software thing Theyd open it for europe but not for the US In Europe we use WhatsApp anyways
Why so google can add more to their datamine systems
Ill get right on it
"I think I read somewhere on Reddit technology sub EU is looking into it now

edit here httpswwwredditcomrAndroidcomments16bru8xeusparesapplefrommandatoryrcsfornowarticle"
"Wdym Allow Apple to adopt it  

You havent read the document have you  
You dont know its up to the USB consortium companies to decide what common port to use do you "
"Airpod pros will start coming with USBc as well Your apple watch already had its own charging pod anyways

Now you can charge your ipad macbook iphone and anything else modern with the same cable"
They are making it sound like they are doing it out of the kindness of their heart and not because of the EU
But look at apple now theyve brought back MagSafe HDMI and other ports back to the MacBook Air lol
" I mean everywhere except phones apple has been essentially leading the pack on USBC so its basically true 

I see you dont use Airpods Or an Apple Watch"
Having worked at AppleCare when iPads switched to USBC yes there were a lot of vocal customers who preferred to continue with Lightning and felt duped that they had a device with a different port A lot of customers out there like using the plethora of cables theyve accumulated Do you remember when cellphones first came out and nearly every model used a different charger Thats why Apple made a long commitment to assure customers they would get longevity out of their accessories
"Think about it iPads moved Macs moved iPhones didnt

I need you to think about all of this real hard A lot harder than you already have Because it very obviously and very clearly disputes the point you think youre making

You can try to cope

Its not cope I am stating objective facts You are coping and seething because you think Im defending a company you want to criticize when all Im actually doing is correcting a fact

and say its because of the 10 year commitment but then I ask you is it any better that Apple committed to a port on a phone for over 5 years when there were far better alternatives

USBC was not ready when Apple wanted to drop the old 30pin connector thats the only reason why they developed Lightning Apple is one of the biggest forces behind USBC its weird to think they somehow have a problem with the concept The 10 year commitment was specifically a result of their users and their accessory partners complaining that dropping the 30pin connector left them with a lot of useless products

This isnt a debate dude and you dont have to be so mad and so argumentative about it I believe in you and I know you can listen to these facts and leave this conversation a bit smarter than you were"
"exactly People still refuse to believe it but its just clear at this point that apple bet on the wrong horse in terms of connector which is why were were stuck on lightning this long

Their plan 58 years ago was to be without a connector at this point which is why they never made an effort to change the iphone to usbc or put the plan into motion But as well all know wireless charging speed and efficiency didnt evolve fast enough Lightning got more outdated every year but they stuck to it because why do something they actually dont want to Now their hand was forced which is why its here"
The rumors about the 15 having USBC came out when the iPhone 13 was about to come out
The fanboys are the people falsely claiming Apple only did this because of the EU THE EUS REGULATIONS ARE NOT EVEN IN EFFECT YET Its astonishing how stupid you sound
"They got the 48mp main sensor 14pro SoC and dynamic island

Honestly the only thing that sways me away is 60hz and USB 20 90hz wouldve probably convinced me to get a 15 instead of 15 pro

Dont really care for the titanium dont really need 5x optical zoom had an S22 Ultra briefly and the 10x optical zoom was a neat party trick and thats about it dont need ray tracing on my phone

15 is basically a 14pro without a 120hz and AOD"
"Yep I was in a similar situation to you in regards to upgrading I had a crappy xiaomi phone still had 90hz display too but wanted to upgrade and get the iPhone 14 as I havent used an Apple product since 2015 and wanted to try something new But was shocked to learn the screen was still 60hz lol I wouldve even accepted a 90hz screen aswell but 60hz is just no in 2023 on a phone that costs 1k where Im at noooo way Ended up getting the new galaxy s23 and Im happy with it 

Was considering waiting until the iPhone 15 because I was certain they would at least put a higher refresh rate panel on it but I thought wrong quite disappointed but also glad I didnt waste my time waiting Guess Ill stay with this phone for another 2 or 3 years and hopefully by then all new iPhones will have a 120hz display"
Thats just what happens as technology improves vs when its early in the innovation cycle
I have an iPhone 7 and 8 and they work great
"Thanks Id forgotten

Id kind of wished they keped up with the   s naming  The 15 is definately the 14s"
They are just talking about the overall design language in those groups of phones being similarthe same
My SE2 is doing fine and as long as they dont make new mini models I will keep it until it dies
You arent saving the planet but you arent shitting on it either Its neutral
dont tell me mine is 4 years old
I strive to be this rich
Is a trillion dollar company they can do way better
Its a small startup you have to give them time
If youre lucky
"Ive never used cable to transfer files from this iPhone since I bought it Now I remember it correctly Ive never even used cable to transfer anything from my old Galaxy A51 as well Always just uploaded it to the cloud

I wonder who in what job stores such huge files on their phone to warrant file transfer speeds"
They added a new USB controller to the A17 Pro to support USB 3 Since they were always going to use the A16 in the iPhone 15 its more likely a technical limitation of being stuck on last years SoC Well have to see what happens next year when the iPhone 16 gets the A17
I mean I agree but its not really penny pinching Theyre using the A16 for the 15 which has a USB2 controller on it So theyd have to upgrade all the 15s to A17 which is a bit more than pennies
" USB 2 is ancient and no product should be shipping with t

The vast majority of users arent going to care about the USB 2 transfer speed  which means that it absolutely should be shipping with USB 2 transfer speeds Thats what should means here Additionally I think youre not factoring in the A16 chip"
give it a week or two and youll likely adjust right back
pacific blue 12 clears this
Yea the navy is pretty nice
Eh I still consider iPhone 12s blue color to be the best
Man the iPhone 13 line had the best colors The blue green and red were stunning and the other colors werent necessarily boring they looked great on the phones I remember being upset at how the 14s colors were less vibrant but the 15s colors make those look oversaturated in comparison lol
If its any sort of consolation the FineWoven cases for the 15 lineup are available in Pacific Blue for some reason But yeah not a fan of the regular 15s blue either Its already an incredibly pale blue and the frosted glass kind of works against it here by making the colour even more washed out
I think eventually they will have to upgrade Already embarrassing that the pixel 7a has 90hz for 500 along with every other flagship for the last 5 years or so Im sure they will milk the 60hz displays for as long as possible tho to entice ppl to get the pro models who dont really need the cameras
tHe hUmAN eYE cAnt sEe pAsSeD 60hZ
Im the same I can just tell the difference below 60 but I have an M32UC and M28U right now to each other with only the M32UC at 144hz thunderbolt bandwidth cap and honestly absolutely cant tell the difference Maybe if I started pixel peeping but in my everyday usage I absolutely cant tell
Wait till you hear that the iphone can even go down to 1 hz refresh rate for battery life
That wasnt the point of my comment People who know what this stuff means might be able to tell But a huge majority of people have no idea what any of it means and even having it pointed out to them in real time either cant tell or dont care
"I am probably one of those geeks in that I am a SWE and follow this subreddit and I could not give less of a fuck about 120hz iphone

Sure I like it on my computer but it is such a non issue on a phone for me"
thats true id argue they dont really care about any of the Pro stuff they just want the new iPhone and go about their daily routines Apple has made a fortune on this customer and the gravy train appears to be pretty solid indeed
It doesnt matter its still 800 dollars lol
Still no excuse to have a 60Hz display on an 800 phone
"I swear I remember people complaining about refresh rate when the 12 came out but I didnt notice anything going from the iPhone 11 Pro to iPhone 12 since both were 60 Hz  I also didnt notice anything going from the iPhone 12 to the iPhone 13 Pro with the increased refresh rate  But after about a year of using the 13 Pro and using a 12 again I noticed the difference

So in short people who have never experienced more than 60 Hz will never know until they go to a higher rate and then try to move back"
And the sheeps will have everything to defend forever
What is this weird complacency logic The average person cant tell the difference between A14 and A16 so they shouldnt keep improving their processors
"I remember this same argument about the bezels with the 8 vs X

The average user does care Apple is just making calculated business moves to maximise profits"
I look more like this idk what that is really and how it matters when I spend 90 of my time on my phone on Reddit or YouTube
"I agree that 99 of people will have no idea what youre talking about if you say it to them but those same people absolutely notice the difference if you give them 2 devices one with and one without a higher refresh screen 

They dont know what it is but Ive heard people comment about how much smoother one feels that the other Often they think its that one phone is more powerful because things look nicer when scrolling etc"
"its such a terrible excuseand one they got incredibly wrong

they should say the typical base iphone user does not know they want x featureand even then like i said its a terrible excuse"
"Have you ever used your phone in the cold and you can see that the refresh rate has lowered

Going from 120 to 60 feels like that Granted what you dont know wont hurt you but its a real cant go back situation once you do cross over"
And thats why you happily pay a premium price for base model type stuff
"From a business perspective it makes a ton of sense For people that dont know what refresh rate isand or dont care about it meaning the VAST majority of apple customers it doesnt matter

For people that care about that sort of thing Apple charges more for that Theyre offering different phones for different type of people and charging more money when they can I doubt it would cost Apple much  to add in ProMotion to the regular models but why would they when they can make money using that as a feature for the Pro iPhones

Of course this isnt desirable for the consumer but like all other Fortune 500 companies Apple isnt a proconsumer company"
Its not an excuse its a reason 99 of iPhone customers dont give two shits about refresh rate why would they spend the money to add it
"By their lame logic Apple should just keep using A14 since the average person cant tell the difference Lower the ppi of their displays while theyre at it Imagine going against people who want more for their money 

Actual bootlicker logic "
I think its nice to have the price option for those who dont need it Im really not sure outside of gaming that youre seeing much of an effect with 120hz really
"It explains the business case You can think it sucks but Apple is a business and doesnt care about anything except money   

This move makes them the most money  

Your part in the dance is to look at whats on offer and decide whether youll pay for the Pro upgrade get the standard 15 hold off for a year or switch to a competitor"
And 60hz is fine for 99 percent of standard iPhone users If they made the standard iPhone high refresh theyd see a drastic drop in sales of the pro model
it is tho as a company why would you spend more money on something you know that customer base doesnt want lol
"the excuse is apple is a publicly traded company and every decision they make is towards raising their stock price

saving 1 on a million units is still 1m"
"They dont need an excuse theyre a business   


it naive to think otherwise They dont care about your best interests and you only disappoint yourself to expect otherwise"
Sure it is  the number of people who genuinely care are vanishingly small  Would hardly be worth the cost
Theyre not saying its customer driven in the way you mean  Theyre saying its profit driven based on what makes the most financial sense to try to sell to the customer
"My mom cant tell the difference and Id bet most 50 yo cant either How do I know that Because that atrocious motion smoothing is left on everyones TV

She can tell the difference btwn a notch and a dynamic island So migrate down the noticeable features from Pro to Regular model and retain the nonnoticeable features to make the Pro seem like a better value proposition"
Except for the added cost  Again its just not a necessity for me
shush putting a 120Hz panel on a lot of those Androids is a total waste and nothing but marketing its the modern day equivalent of selling the consumer a 5plus year old GPU with a shiny new name and slapping 1TB of VRAM on itthe average person will believe they have the best with no understanding that all that VRAM is a complete waste and the card cannot utilize it
Seriously many Android phones of half the market get support for maybe 3 years  Apple supports theirs for 6 or more  Maybe thats what youre getting with the price tag
Its really fine If you dont like it dont pay for it The world continues to turn
The calculators CPU is the same as car infotainment systems so it does support the addition of a modem GPS etc The software doesnt have support for this of course but it does run a version of FreeRTOS which could be programmed to work with the above
Get the feeling they are throwing in a USB2 cable and you need to buy a USB3 cable based on something a guy said about USB 3 cables being optional
Probably is
Yep USB 2 on 15 non pro
It is
That would be crazy wouldnt it
14 Pro last years model
Could be 2015 2014 is what came up in my Google search
USB C was introduced in 2012 but Apple didnt start adopting it until 2014
completely missed the point but go  ahead and just defend a trillion dollar company 
because they had that shit for years and just refused to use it on their iPhones Look at us weve had it for years but now because the EU is forcing our hands even you idiots will get to enjoy it Its just  courageous
I had a red what I think was the 6s or 7 and I loved that phone I hate not being able to get a bright red Pro or even regular phone right now
Thats probably when theyll announce the new iPhone SE too
They somehow made me hate Octavia Spencer being on screen
I agree they need to go back to the live keynotes
Sorry I shouted too soon I was pretty sure they mentioned product red but it must have been for Watch Sorry
Requires more sheep blood
They said besides the cameras The titanium is probably not gonna matter as much because of the wear revealing the titanium underneath and the glass is the most vulnerable resulting in most repairs
Are you telling me youve never wanted to fold your iPhone in half
"My 300 Poco has a 144hz display

Just more things for Apple to drip feed over the years"
Using a 13 pro currently and really never had that problem
I agree Id it was a bit lighter it would have perfect
This lol Yall arent going to leave the ecosystem over 60hz display
Well I havent bought an iPhone since 2017 so I guess its been nonempty that long
Im also regularly on rAndroid
lol euros stay losing
None that matter
You mean like Alaska
Lmfao 25 sales tax is a joke right
"Where do you live with a 25 sales tax

Edit It appears the answer is Europe although I wouldnt expect Europeans to use the  sign"
Oh ok
mmm atm Euro is very close to dollar so I tend to use them interchangeably  7 cent difference
"I mean a lot of Mini USB has mostly died I have a ton of old cables still This will always happen 

I still find it funny that Android users could charge their phones on newer iPad and Macbook chargers but iPhone people couldnt 

But over time more and more devices are using USBC My 2 work laptops  personal laptop all do usbc My ear buds keyboard and mouse all use it to charge 

Its so easy to travel with 13 cables now because they all use usbc Its Apples fault for holding out so long They probably still would if not for the EU

With that said Apple could do a trade in program that offers discounts if buying a new phone if they really cared about the environment want the good PR"
"Ah understood I initially misread

That said though when the day comes when my entire house has USB devices well be tossing all our old lightning cables rather than buying adapters to continue using our existing cables"
"I get where youre coming from but if Apple were to produce adapters for a cable that theyre dropping support for on their flagship product that would be antithetical to their goal of being carbon neutral 

Plus Apple likes outsourcing the lightning cable to 3rd party manufactures It reduces their carbon footprint at the company level it cuts out the cost of manufacturing and they get to charge royalties to the 3rd party manufacturers"
AliExpress will full fill that demand super super quick I assume Like 125  adapters everywhere and some might even be decent at that price
Haha yeah good point Make adaptors cheap af Wear the cost so people dont have to throw away their current cables and chargers Or even include it in the box for free its still USB 20 speeds so nothing really has changed except for the connector
Not even They said something along the lines of USBC has become recognized as an industry standard connector and so weve added it to the iPhone 15
I mean you could just watch the stream
"Except it is The limiting factor is the A16 chip doesnt handle those speeds Theyd have to bump it up to the A17 

Now if they do it again next year thats a concern I guess But again I havent transferred anything via copper since the 30pin days I really dont care"
Im going to slap an opaque case on this phone but Ill know in my mind what color is under it
It isnt that absurd to offer a white and black option consistently over the years
SKU nightmare lmao
You will get it Its USBC and when you will change your device you will only have to use USBC I know that buying new hardware iPhone and AirPods sucks but there is only one responsible for this and people have to admit thats Apple itself
Yeah  true I have plenty of USB C devices and to all intents and purposes the standardisation of the socket at least  capabilities of different USB cablesports varies still is a huge step forward that I welcome That said lightening still has a place in my heart as it was just a design that stood the test of time so well I also have to give credit to Apple for shunning micro USB when every other manufacturer was adopting it  that really was a diabolical design that rightfully deserved to die quickly
"the one thing I dont like about USBC is the flimsy connector inside and the inability to tell what cableport does what how much datapower it can carry and if the connection will work I feel like I am just connecting stuff and expecting it to work hopefully they get a little symbol setup or something

For example some cables carry 40w some 60w Some USBC ports are PD some arent My hard drive can connect to my iPhone but will it do anything will it draw power I dont know"
fuck the USBC cable
Yeah  agreed I bet Apple actually put time into details like this in the way that premium car companies put time into getting the right click and weighting on buttons and dials in the cabindashboard Probably way more so than most other companies as well given that theyre not short on resources to dedicate to all the small details
"It isnt great but its been better than the Nintendo switches and Hp laptops with usbc dock stations 

To replace the port on a switch costs almost as much as a used switch cause of all the tiny prongs I found out Hopefully apples take is a small board with ribbon cable to main board to fix faulty ports"
Since you understand technology so well tell me the usecase of data transfer via cable for the average iPhone user
"They arent insulting people  They unlike you understand that real people that actually use base model phones dont care about wired transfer speeds  

They understand that using last years chip saves them millions and the people that for some stupid reason want to do professional photography and videography on their iPhones can buy the pro models"
wow you are right   Do they always remove pro models  Dont remember   But they have to I guess since the phones dont change much at all year to year
"Pixel line put out dirt cheap phones that went toe to toe on photos video was at least as good as the basic iPhone models of course iPhone Pros still dominated the video performance and quality 

Its okay to respect the competition Sometimes Android phones do hardware or software things that forces Apple to innovate and thats good"
Ended that fool Dang
I dont know about you but there is little difference between images taken by Pixel phones and iPhones these days
Iphone se is very similar to 6s
You just reminded me of the dozen or so 30 pin connectors I kept in my cable box just in case I ever need one
Its an iPhone nobody is ever happy about anything 
literally all of my phones were androids i recently bought an apple phone
Im still on an 11 Max Pro in Forest Green so jumping to a 15 Max Pro in Titanium White is my current plan Once availability and storereservations allow Im in no rush
but samsung runs android in what way would that be better 
Bluetooth headphones are so much better than wireless headphones its not even a competition Noone wants wired headphones back All the other phone companies have phased out the headphone jack too Boomer
"Well thats dumb You can thank apple for their MFi eco system

Most car units are both android auto and Apple car play I would hate to think youd have to swap USB cables each time you switch between android and apple cause you need an apple certified cable The U in USB stands for universal It should just work"
This is not true I expect CarPlay will work with any proper USBC cable the issue being many USB cables are not actually up to spec
Curious what those security reasons would be
Absolutely however they save money and Harden the case against incursion of water and othererliquids
They really see no need in it And honestly neither do I 27w is honestly fast enough
Apple force downloaded a U2 album onto everyones iPhone in 2014
And to add to narwhals statement most countries at the time didnt have unlimited data so there was that Peoples phones filled up and at the time iPhones tended to have some interesting problems occur if peoples phones were full
Damn wish theyd give me mine in advance
Wow someone with a brain What a concept
Then maybe specify Dude just 25k 25k pennies
Its American product on a American website
Cry more
Youre not just being down voted for that but also for your shitty attitude dont get it twisted
I guess all the people downvoting the comment I replied to are in the same boat as you Whats funny is I actually want a matte phone as the 13 is so slippery I dropped it immediately and shatted it before my case arrived Never broken a phone in my life Had to buy apple insurance after the fact and got it replaced But I put it straight in a case now it doesnt matter But happy its time for you to upgrade it will be a nice one for ya
haha I wish Im luckily happily married and no longer have to worry about thinking a new phone or any tech is attractive to the opposite sex She does like me to get the occasional haircut and I dress respectfully though Those are a bit cheaper and less harmful to the planet as well
Thank you I wasnt sure if the charging speed wouldve impacted
This right here is the reason but your average consumer wont understand this
"If wireless speeds are beating the only available wired interface for your device especially considering 80211 is half duplex then you are doing it wrong  

I get that its supposed to be a phone but USB 20 was an old spec well established across industries and penetrating most of the consumer device market when the iPhone was invented

I would almost prefer  Firewire over USB 20"
Exactly My example was for gigabit Ethernet vs 10 gb Ethernet for which most consumer devices are still using 1gb I definitely didnt mention that anywhere 
Cheap USB thumbdrives support USB 3 so its not
Its never significant to upgrade an iPhone before at least three years now
bro its at least several cents per unit
Me a normie whose media lives in the 
its not
which is exactly why they made it a pro only feature
If you are a content creator theres no reason not to get a pro
We all know its going to be put into the 16 to make it look like an upgrade The cost to put it in is negligible at apples scale and they had to change design stuff anyways to implement usb c so it could have been done at the same time Its just typical apple stuff intentionally gimping things to make other products and future ones look better in comparison
I bet its way below 5 I bet its less than a percent of people that desire  USB2 speeds Just my blind speculation though
Maybe if iPhones had integrated file management system you would actually want to use it as a portable 512GB SSD Guess apple hsers literally cant complain about features they dont know exist
Yes they always use the high end models to subsidize the more widely used phones
Theres a reason why you have to twist my words to make your point I didnt say no one cares Use the word I actually used and I think your question will answer itself
The excuse is basically nobody buying the base 15 cares and the few people that do are most likely going to go for the Pro or an Android phone anyway
"It doesnt even require the same charging speeds

The only requirement is that the device can be charged with USBC

Theres nothing about data transfers or even that it must only be charged by USBC  Technically they could have included Lightning as well and limited USBC charging to 01W or something absurd like that"
Nope October 2024 Which means the iPhone 16 will have already been released and will be grandfathered into the old laws
"When apple released lightning they said this will be the standard for the next 10 years And then on the 11th anniversary of that promise they switch to USBC

Which do you think is more likely They promised their customers and shareholders a port a standard that would exist for 10 years and they kept that promise down to the week of its 11th anniversary or they decided to carve to legislative pressures two years early"
Bro I swear to god the Pro model line is the stupidest ass shit you ever saw  they should have stuck with the regular iPhone and iPhone Plus naming scheme
They couldve atleast chipped in a 90Hz display for the non pro models
IMO the regular iPhones should have 120Hz by now the difference should be that the pros get the promotion displays and the nonpros are either locked at 120Hz or can be set to 60Hz or 120Hz
Working like an incentive for Samsung for me tbh
Its pretty much the only thing that makes me get the pro and not the nonpro they know what theyre doing
The camera is has been and will be the main selling point of the pro
Thats the question I have too  does the 15 plus have a 120hz display
Probably because its 799 so for a premium phone youd expect premium features
90 would be nice
Because youre spending 800 on a premium phone in 2023 that doesnt have features midrange androids do
"120hz will burn out your screen much faster than 60hz

Android users dont care because they have to buy a new phone every 23 years anyway due to lack of updates security patches general instability and cheap hardware components"
"Agreed 
The dealer when I was buying my 13 said the 13 and 14 are pretty much exactly the same Went with the 13 Cheaper Just as good as the 14 And I dont have any urges to upgrade Especially when this is paid off and my cell phone bill gets cut in half"
Got it thanks Im on an 11pro with a gimped battery so this is probably my upgrade Wish there was more but itll be a good upgrade Iphone 2 3G  5  Xupgraded to 11pro due to x shitting the bed and been holding on
Someone else mentioned how the 14 was such a good camera upgrade Lenses maybe but theres so much complaining going on about overprocessing that I think my 12PM will produce better photos
the camera and 120hz are really the only major bumps dynamic island is something i guess but the camera jump was the first one in a while and it was huge and 120hz is also pretty massive
Thats an entirely different thing PWM dimming has nothing to do with refresh rate
Same here Ive just changed my pixel 6 from 90hz to 60hz to see how I feel about it
I have a feeling that may be because of other factors though
How is this myth still around
"Have you ever used a 120 hz or 90 hz device 

You should go to the doctor if you cant tell the difference between that and 60 hz lmao

Normal human beings can absolutely tell the difference"
This is such a TV sales at Circuit City in 2006 take lol  Everyone can tell the difference btw 23hz and 60hz and to a lesser extent 120hz  Granted Im generally happy with 60
lmao you cannot be serious
You are very very mistaken
Id say please Congress then but usually when we ask them to do useful things they tend to do the opposite
Aye WhatsApp has already begun work on the integration as leaks suggested yesterday
Europeans care so much about data privacy and then are in love with a messaging service owned by FacebookMeta I dont get it iMessage was encrypted since release WhatsApp only started using the Signal protocol in 2018 9 years after release
Exactly lets keep on making everything closedPeople like you are insufferableThey could still follow the RCS protocol but with an added layer of protection made by themThere are so many ways they could be less restrictive and still safe
Its either them or Apple Pick your poison
I know but realistically theres no way I can afford to upgrade everything at the same time The fact that the watch requires a proprietary charger that also charges the AirPods but wont charge the phone and the phone can use a wireless charger that wont work with the watch but WILL work with the AirPods is quite ridiculous
They were pretty obviously going to be making this switch already but they promised 10 years of Lightning when it came out and that was in 2012 It makes sense to have waited since everyone flipped so much when they changed from the 30pin Perhaps the EU ruling made the change happen faster but this has been in the cards for a while
The MacBook Air does not have hdmi or other ports
"Yeah Apple bet big on manufactures of accessories and PC laptops going as hard as they were on USBC but it did not come to fruition 

Ill be honest though I was fine with the USBC as all of the ports what ruined for me on those early macbooks was the overly thin body and the USBC ports durability All of the ports on my 2017 macbook except for 1 is only partially functional and a big reason for that is accidental tugs on the AC power cord causing wear on the USBC port"
Airpods are a companion device for the iPhone Obviously theyre going to keep it on the same charging cable And apple watches wireless charge so not really sure what your point is there
" Having worked at AppleCare when iPads switched to USBC yes there were a lot of vocal customers who preferred to continue with Lightning and felt duped that they had a device with a different port

Sounds like this could have been solved with Apple switching all devices to USBC at same time

Also Apple could include adaptors to ease customers into the transition if they wanted to But they didnt "
"Thats why Apple made a long commitment to assure customers they would get longevity out of their accessories

And not using the world wide standard like usb because they wanted to milk their customers You worked for AppleCare so you know that to be true

Now thanks to EU they finally are forced to a proconsumer practice"
Meh Its fine Believe what you want
" Lightning got more outdated every year but they stuck to it because why do something they actually dont want to

Its crazy cause the iPad Pros had it and they went all in on USBC with the Macbook at one point too

I dont understand why they didnt just do it lol"
And they introduced it at the last minute before Europe banned their phones
For that price just get the 14 Pro man the 15 is a scam
So wouldnt it be smarter to just get a 14pro  Lol
To be fair everything after the iphone 12 could be the iphone 12 SSSS
Oh ok yeah fair enough
I know  sometimes its hard to believe that Im among the small population of iPhone users who actually likes the mini form factor Its so comfortable to hold Thought it would be more popular
"Buy all carbon neutral products dont contribute to global warming save the world 

Feel good about yourself consumerism lifestyle justified buy more products"
Believe me Im really not lol I just have a firm grip and Apple Care I use a case when Im working out though
"I mean thats mixed logic eg the vast majority of users dont need more then an A12 chip but apple is going to ship it with the A16

The reason apple is using USB 20 is that there arent enough people to challenge it Its the same reason they stuck with lightning all these years so to me its like they finally conceded but heres a middle finger

I dont really care I just find it amusing apple really doesnt give any concessions"
"You will if you dont have any other 120160Hz devices Its really hard to go back when your PC monitor is 144Hz and your MacBook Pro is 120Hz

If you spend a couple hours on the PC or MacBook and go back to 60Hz its pretty jarring In my experience I can adjust after a few minutes of use but you will have that same damn this is 60Hz feeling after using any of your other devices"
This happened to me 60Hz felt choppy for like 45 days then it became the norm and looks fine
Yeah but why would you want to lol
Pretty nice but not great I prefer my 12 Pro blue
" If its any sort of consolation the FineWoven cases for the 15 lineup are available in Pacific Blue for some reason

Thats very weird Not sure if I want to buy another overpriced apple phone case after my experience with their 12 Pro leather case though It broke after less than 15 years"
Dude my gf picked up a used pixel 5 which already has 90hz Im actually pissed how smooth her scrolling is compared to my iPhone 13
They wont People are paying 1000 every year for the same goddman phone
Youre a human eye
Pixel peeping What are you trying to look for
Feel the same way I do like 5 things on it and nothing that necessitates 120hz
same lol glad Im not the only one
You think the base models are more profitable than the pro and pro max models
The better processors have better battery life and make using the phone faster The smoothness of the scrolling and swiping isnt something most iPhone users complain about Its never been a problem because iPhones have always had smooth scrolling compared to Android It was one of the original things that separated them
The truly average user is going to be annoyed that their old Lightning cables wont work with their new phone
Scrolling on reddit is way smoother with 120hz vs 60 but like I said to another guy it only matters once you experience it and try to go back it will of course look fine if its what youre used to
12 doesnt have 120
No shit theyre both 60 Hz
"Why bring the 48MP camera to the base 15 range then Most consumers wouldnt even know what RAW stands for much less how to enable it Whereas promotion is a feature all users could experience every moment they use their phone like the rest of the world on Android 

They screwed themselves by calling it ProMotion making people believe its a Pro feature"
I feel like 90hz would be a good compromise for the nonpro phones where it would allow them to better compete with Android phones which offer high refresh screens on phones costing half the price of the regular 15 but still have a differentiation from the 120hz pro phones
Bootlicker because they dont care about refresh rate  Do you people just use that term for anybody that disagrees with you  The word is meaningless anymore
You experience 120Hz more using the phone doing daily tasks than in gaming Scrolling and animations becomes extremely smooth in apps
a 100 budget android phone would be fine for 99 of people but thats a terrible excuse for an 800 smartphone in 2023 There are 200 Android phones with 120hz displays and they will feel noticably smoother than the upcoming iPhone 15 Its not like it would be too expensive to implement to create a better product Its just for segmentation
Its fine because they dont know better I am sure 99 percent of standard iPhone users will be fine with the A15 chipso you dont think Apple should have upgraded that either right
"  theyd see a drastic drop in sales of the pro model

Yes because 60Hz is not fine"
not if its 90hz
" If they made the standard iPhone high refresh theyd see a drastic drop in sales of the pro model

Sounds like they need better stuff to differentiate the models if we go by your argument of decreased sales for such a simple feature

Withholding almost 5 year old industry standard tech from their customers for arbitrary reasons is bad If thats the deciding factor then the pro is not good enough or theyre not confident enough with the rest of the differentiators"
Dont bring logic here
120hz display phones start at around 400 There is no excuse for apple to have flagship pricing and entry level phone specs An iPhone should not have any spec that is worse than a 400 phones spec Flagship phones even have variable refresh rate a feature that lets the phone go down from 120hz to 10hz to save battery life depending on what youre doing reading watching videos static screen Its a feature theyre gonna release down the line and pull the classic All new feature on an iPhone that has been available on most other phones for 4 years now
"They really wont Its just like the 120Hz display Apple can keep artificially gimping the transfer speeds and the only people that notice or care will be buying the pro phone anyway

I dont agree with them gimping it however literally 99 of people airdrop or access their stuff via the cloud anyways People back up via iCloud and so people rarely connect their phone to macPC to hardware back up anymore

I like to do backups to external SSD for photos just in case for some reason my iCloud data shits the bed but its a very nicheminority case Someone filming enough content to regularly save time via USB 3 transfer is also a minority case"
Once youve had 120hz you wont buy a phone without it Every time I use an iPhone it feels sluggish in comparison just because of the refresh rate
You have 0 idea what you are talking about
"Samsung supports their phones for 5 years now and the specs you get for the price are an order of magnitude better

For comparisons sake the base iPhone 15 is the same price as the S23 Ultra here 

But do keep using that card to defend Apple cheaping out though"
Ah the age old nobody is forcing you to buy it retort to any kind of valid complaint
Yeah Thats standard for phones also
"usb2 speeds on nonpros   
the pros get 10gbps if you use the correct cable which kinda sounds like they wont provide one petty af"
Well thats disappointing
That was the 7 Putting a white bezel on that phone was such a mistake totally wouldve gotten one with black
Maybe so
Ah good point saw your comment saying what was on pros and somehow missed their comment about cameras So yea just the titanium then
Remember bending an iPhone like Beckham 
It really isnt a big deal sure it sucks that such an expensive phone doesnt have it but it really changes nothing my ipad pro could be 60hz and I wouldnt care
especially the idea of going to fucking samsung lol
How much is your lifetime hospital bill If more than 0 you lost
979 here including tax
Well the Europe market mattered enough to Apple to be forced to get USBC
Least xenophobic American
LMAOOOOO
Lol this is actually funny
Isnt nationalism great
The highest combined state  local sales tax is Chicago with just over 10 The iPhone is still under 900 with that
19 in Germany and most of Europe has similar sales tax
Hungary has 27 VAT lol
21 VAT is common in most of EU
Denmark
most of europe has 2030 sales tax
We still get higher prices
"They are producing the adaptershttpswwwapplecomshopproductMUQX3AMAusbctolightningadapterfnode56b2612dae0cfac85fb65aed6255ff87df1a399bd52bd07f84fd5aebb1797ac330ad424820bc9c436a176436e8760d3b3f9fd0223389bf28c9611017b157ced4ca6e91bcb9fa5c291c4f5fcd25a71c9983241ff6c5e1c9bb97ea3b172a0b00e2 

My point is that the adapter pricing being the same as a cable will cause consumers to toss their old cables entirely ensuring more trash in the landfill  Now as to who is producing them I have no idea but the pricing is messed up when you look at all the greenwashing they just threw at us"
I realize that but the implicit messaging from Apple in their pricing makes their green claims appear spurious at best
I dont know the unit costs but I remember Applebranded minijack to lightning adapters were like 10 bucks  I am still using mine
"People dont realize Apple worked with Intel HP and Microsoft to invent Type C in 2014 and were one of the first to use it in products in 2015 

While it is indeed irritating they waited to be forced to use it on their phones peoples behavior is more irritating Yall remember what phone charging was before iPhone came along right"
What i meant is that you cant release an usbc and call it something else The designtechnology is probably patented under that name So no fancy name
transferring songs videos especially 4k videos wait never mind transferring data to a different device may just be a little complicated for apple users ive only been doing it since 1998 and Id appreciate the extra speed especially for 800 dollars USB 20 came out in 2000 fucking get with the times
It is absolutely insulting on intelligence Youre minimizing the damage to the usb C I enjoy the simplicity of the iPhone and continue to use it still but every year is disappointing in how they announce old things as innovation Its not 2010 anymore and people are smart enough to keep up with technology where they know apple is treating people are dumb They dont have to be tech savvy or need to use the technology
FireRescue The stock apple cords are are trash weve had somewhat better luck with Anker ones but we only go through a few USBC cords a year with lighting cables its a few dozen a year The lightning cables seems to have one of the contacts on each side wear away killing the cable or the rubber itself just breaks down to nothing usually near the connector Never had any issues with the stock samsung or apple USBC cables
My sisters wedding is literally the day after launch 23rd I know we have a photographer but I want pictures that I can share the day of Excited this year Probably getting Blue and pairing with a caramel tanned leather case from Andar if they supply it fast enough
For spec whores its better
" Bluetooth headphones are so much better than wireless headphones its not even a competition

Oh I guess Bluetooth isnt considered a wireless technology anymore

Noone wants wired headphones back

Speak for yourself please

All the other phone companies have phased out the headphone jack too

Yeah because apple showed us you can strip out features and make people pay more than before some will even defend that decision on social media"
And prevent the use of said buttons when theyre wet because it cant tell if your thumb is made of skin or something else
That was so bad
It also took up a lot of space A lot of people only had like 8GB of storage at the time
I remember that
"Why Its pretty easy to assume Im not American

Omg different information either they are joking have incorrect info or they arent American"
Ive been to 15 countries none of them sell iPhone for 799
First world problems hey
"	no longer have to worry about thinking a new phone or any tech is attractive to the opposite sex

Are you sure that anyone over the age of 16 worries about this"
Weve had fast charging before USBC was a thing
that doesnt make it ok the fact its taken them this long to ditch usb 2 speeds at all is a joke
That doesnt excuse them still using USB2 in 2023 I thought apple was meant to be innovative
"I would not be so sure 

The iPad mini has usb 3 on an A15 The iPad Air only has 10Gb despite using the same desktop class SoC as the previous generation Pro which supported 40"
Then explain why the 5 year old iPad pro using an A12 has usb 3 gen 2
Cheap USB thumb drives can barely maintain those speeds for a few seconds because their crappy flash chips cant keep up
"I dont know what the consideration was to not having that in  
However if someones using this for data transfer that means they have heavy content to transfer meaning its probably extremely high quality video or photographs and that person really isnt going to get a 15 theyd get the pro because theyd get much more for it  
I dont think a lot of people actually transfer massive amounts of GBs from their phone and back via cable that it really makes sense to add that in if youre not creating content and Im also not aware of any Android phones that have USB30 transfer speeds but I could be wrong"
And maybe if it wasnt using USB 20 speeds Apple has trained its users that wired connections with their phones are awful No wonder no one does it
"Be more direct 

Are you agreeing that they actively market useless features for high end models"
"Thats a sweeping generalisation

Photos and videos are bigger than ever airdrop is unreliable barely any faster than USB2 and not available on PCs Even if only a small percentage of people ever use it were talking about a basic feature thats been on the market for several years Im still amazed that people happily excuse Apple for excluding basic features on a 800900 device"
bro if that was the case they wouldnt have been so upset with the EU about enforcing usbc it has nothing to do with apple making a 10 year promise also the standard for the next 10 years doesnt mean they will change it up after 10 years All that means is this will last at least 10 years they changed up their ipad pro usb but still kept everything else lighting so if that was the case apple would have made everthing usbc back then
"Plus is for the larger size Pro is for additional features 

Pro Max is whats dumb its the large version of the Pro so it should be either Max or Pro Plus 

Then again the entire modern Apple naming scheme is shit On macs you have the M2 the M2 Pro the M2 Max and the M2 Ultra which is above the max because   And pretty much all they are is larger combinations of the same base modules"
"Plus isnt as ego stroking as pro They focus tested it Plus gives folks a semi while pro makes one  I can only get so hard

Figure it out "
Ya but from a business standpoint its a dumb idea People are going to buy iPhone regardless so why would apple ever do something that nice Being nice only hurts profitability
"If Apple enabled the option for 120hz but didnt specifically notify the user or have it on by default I would wager 90 would remain at 60hz 

These are iPhone users Their phones are fashionable appliances"
Its not that noticeable most users wouldnt care
"Yup why on earth would you pay 800 for an iphone 15 when you could get a brand new s23 for 680 which has a 120hz screen telephoto camera etc  


The 800 model is legitimately a SCAM"
well they brought the 14 pros camera down to the 15 model sounds like 2nd priority to me
I believe the 15 plus is 60hz Id like to buy one of them and the 120hz is the only thing swaying me towards the 14 pro max
People are buying it regardless why cut into profits like that
I agree it just makes for a smoother experience I suspect the reason is mostly due to the hit to battery life
"lmfao what

A panel does not die faster because it has a higher refresh rate Stop it with your nonsense

The fact that a flagship iPhone doesnt have a high refresh display is a fucking disgrace in 2023"
Then explain why they put a worse feature according to you onto the pro models
its the paid off part that really seals the deal for me too lol
the 13 pro and 14 pro both have 120hz so you might want to consider one of those as well
Oh thats good to know We got a ten month old now and we need good photos of them of course but so far i was happy with what the 12PM produces But maybe once I compare
Blergh just tried it on my P6P and its night and day difference in smoothness
Well the filibuster is kind of a problem
"Europeans are not basing their privacy on trust they are basing it on fear Meta or Apple would both get blasted if private data leaked or was used inappropriately so it doesnt matter which one you use


And the apps are based on convenience messenger is used because everyone had Facebook and WhatsApp used mobile numbers so it was easy to get into Some people use Viber too"
Because the worlds and Europes 70 population uses Android ie no access to imessage The world is bigger than the blue v green bubble bullcrap sold by apple to its fanatics
"Everyone data on open systems available to every advertising engine  
Nope no thanks corporate shill"
Definitely Apple then
Sure but thats a shortcoming of Apples wireless charging Not a downside of migrating from lightning to the ubiquitous usbc
it just so happens they did it the year before they would have been legally requerided to
I think they meant Macbook Pro
"I think it was less about others not going as hard on usb c than it was about people and apple realizing how inconvinient it is to carry around dongles over having the most commonly used ports be built in  

The magsafe being the biggest removal for me Im just glad they brought it back on the new macbooks before I had to get a new one"
"Mostly just that not everything except phones is USBC when it comes to Apple

Besides Airpods are just much a companion for laptops and tablets as they are for the phones"
If they transitioned early people like you would have called them liars for reneging on their 10 year lightning commitment andor called it a money grab to make people get new accessories If they include adapters then that creates ewaste for anyone who doesnt need the adapter and the EU would make some law punishing them for that You can go back and look at when Apple movedon from 30pin People were upset even though lightning was better in every way People like you are just perpetually mining salt
"If they were milking customers why change the iPads years ago They didnt make a commitment to lightning on iPads but they did on iPhones They also could have released another model year of iPhones with lighting this year to continue milking customers before they need to be compliant but they didnt they switched the year the 10 year promise expired
Also if the EU is so worried about customer protections why dont they target EU companies like BMW that are innovating things like heated seat subscriptions That seems more anticonsumer than an alternate charging port"
"No Trump thats not how real life works You cant just believe what you want when it comes to facts

It is objectively true that Apple committed to using Lightning on the iPhone for 10 years

It is objectively true that this 10 year period ended this year

It is objectively true that Apple has already migrated almost their entire product line to USBC prior to the iPhone adopting it as well

It is objectively true that the EUs USBC regulations do not apply to this years products

If you know all those facts you cannot conclude that theyre only making this change because theyre forced to"
"Last minute  The deadline is Christmas 2024  The iPhone 16 could legally have been lightning phones and been sold that way for their entire lifespan 

This port change came this year because this is the standard threeyear body update"
"You could say that going back to iPhone 2g

Why get a 14 when you can get a 13 pro

Why get a 13 when you can get a 12 pro

Why get 12 when you can get a 11 pro

Why get a 11 when you can get a XS"
Theres a patch for that
"Thank you

I dont get why people like big smartphones Like if you want to game are watch stuff  get the iPad The iPhone is for communication and I want this to be as small and thin as possible I am so sad that I missed the 13 mini but at that point my SE was to new to even consider it

Edit A iPhone 15 mini with USBC would be perfect"
"I consider myself the opposite of wealthy also and have dropped my caseless iPhone 12 more times than I can count Onto concrete asphalt tile into the deep ends of pools Just recently my phone slid off of the top bunk in a Refugio and it hit the tile floor and its impact basically woke everyone up in the room Phone still has not shattered Still looks basically new Ever since the Ceramic Shield the new phones are way more durable

So theres no purpose to covering your phone in all this after market crap hiding it from view and just making it bulkier and allowing dirt to build up in all the added gaps and creases

Cases and screen protectors are now a grift Unless youre a construction worker or prone to decking your phone at the ground out of rage you really dont need all the extra plastic shit adhered to your phone anymore"
Apple Care is for the rich
"overpriced cloud storage

Its a dollar a month for 50 extra gigs Whats fairly price in your opinion lol"
IDK I just use Google for storage Never really thought about it Its cheap and most digital data Id need or want to share is mostly on the web anyway these days except for maybe family photos and videos
I think youre overestimating just how few people actually use data transfer over USB on their iPhones I dont believe the number of people is that low with things like the A16 chip There is a significant amount of highly tech savvy people that will indeed utilize the A16 chip There are a lot of devs sysadmins pentesters MLAI people out there that will use the A16 chip Take this with a grain of salt because its an anecdote I know several people in all of those fields and none of them use the port for anything other than charging  All will most likely utilize the A16 chip
Yee just turn on low battery mode and you can feel the 60hz instantly I cant go back now lol
"Very true for video games 120hz is like a night and day difference Everything feels silky smooth 

IMO prob not necessary for a phone screen but it would be nice and it would be very noticeable"
Pacific Blue is the best iPhone colour theres ever been
Like staring at the screen to purposefully spot the difference
Id argue most people do nothing that even necessitates a new iPhone at all Why draw the line at 60hz vs 120hz No reason not to have 90hz at least on a 800 phone If we are just going by whats necessary there doesnt need to be a new iPhone at all
Unless you daily a phone with a high refresh rate display you really wont understand why people are pushing for high refresh rate displays on phones
no idea i do know that Apple makes a killing on both however it certainly wouldnt surprise me
"They dont complain about it because they havent experienced better

Its okay if you love complacency "
Again its not about the average user or whatever its all about maximising profits
Whoops I thought they started with the 12 My bad
"Who knows My guess is that its most likely to compete with the Samsungs abnormally large MP size and Apple probably determined through consumer research that MP size is a much larger defining factor for purchasing rather than display hz You can easily compare MP size between phones but not 120hz to ProMotion

Adding onto this Apple rarely uses the term hz when marketing their phones they only say the display has ProMotion For your grandma comparing Samsung and Apple Samsung might say 120hz display but Apple says ProMotion Which one do you think makes more sense to purchase based off the naming alone

Id bet my left AirPod that Apple found that ProMotion makes more sense sounds more desirable and comes with the trust that consumers place in Apple for their consistently good features Thus is the reason why its put in their Pro phones and not regular lineup Feature marketing is a huge factor that Apple has on lock and likely contributes to them segregating features such as this"
Probably for that cropped telephoto thing without the extra lens
Because the average person wants better photos not refresh rate
because a bigger number looks better on marketing especially against the absurd MP of the Android devices these days even though we know it doesnt matter its all in the postprocessing and software not the camera sensors or optics the average Joe doesnt understand that all he knows is his friend has a 48MP or 50MP on whatever shiny new Android and so he has to be there too
Could be that theyll recoup sensor costs because of volume
They did 48mp so that they can do one more zoom without another lens Thats already amazing for most people
Even if you dont care about it doesnt mean you should be against people who want more for their money Thats why its bootlicking because theyre caring more for the companys interests
"Ehhhhh


Its fine 

Most people dont even notice it"
I owned phones up to 144hz display now daily driving a 13 Mini and can honestly say that 60hz is fine for daily use
Dont waste your time on this sub if you are trying for reasonable discussion
I own a 14 Pro and a 13 Mini the 120Hz is nice but it just isnt a deal breaker
oh please enlighten me mr wizard on why a 120Hz panel is essential on a phone today and how those Androids are so vastly superior ill wait
"LOL

httpswwwandroidauthoritycomsamsungandroidupdates1148888

Taking things a step further Samsung announced in February 2022 that a whole bunch of Galaxy devices will be eligible for four years of Android updates 

Youre off by one  Also Samsung has 24httpsgsstatcountercomvendormarketsharemobile market share which is nowhere close to 

 many Android phones of half the market

Whatever that actually means"
I mean hes right though Half the users in these Apple threads act like they dont even upgrade their phones but once a decade nobodys forcing you to stay at 60hz on a phone There are other options
Its common for low and mid tier Android devices theres not many in the iPhone 15 price range that arent USB3 with suitable cables
Still sucks tho
Yep it was I didnt mind it because I liked the white and if given the choice prefer a white or red one over another color but these new colors are super boring right now even on the regular models
Nothing is wrong with Samsung
Pixel 7 looking mighty sweet though with its USB 32 and 90hz at 12 the price
u do know most of the parts and the screen in the iPhone are Samsung made parts right why the Samsung hate lol what exactly is so bad about them
Well that sucks Still you got good trade in value
Problem 
Man the people in this sub cant take a joke smh
Wait until you hear about places outside the US
" They are producing the adapters 

Oh shit are these new I thought they already had this product line but I could be wrong 

 My point is that the adapter pricing being the same as a cable will cause consumers to toss their old cables entirely ensuring more trash in the landfill Now as to who is producing them I have no idea but the pricing is messed up when you look at all the greenwashing they just threw at us

I agree with the first part of your statement but I dont agree with the characterization of the greenwashing Apple made their carbon neutral by 2023 announcement at the turn of the decade and for all intents and purposes theyre steadily moving towards that goal 

I dont think the EU forcing them to either drop all EU customers or change their hardware is antithetical to that goal 

I think Apple is stuck between a rock and a hard place They dont want to welcome the EU legislation by fully supporting a pivot because itll make them a playable pawn but they also dont want to push so much of the burden on to the consumer that they appear as though theyre maliciously complying"
Yeah true Id say they made it the same price so people are like Mays well just get the new USB C cable and charger then Im half way there
What was phone charging iPhone had its own connector while many other brands used USB
"Okay you are wrong  People dont use it for that  Wifi sync works  No one is transferring songs from their computer MP3 collection to their iPhone anymore 

I guess if you are pirating movies in the 90s you need it but the rest of us have moved on"
"not including a feature that no one will use is Apple calling me stupid

sigh"
"I dont expect you to know this but can I order an iPhone 15 fully unlocked and just pick it up in Apple Store I live near an Apple Store now   Im an ATT customer so my existing iPhone 11 is my main phone number I was hoping I could just buy an IPhone 15 in person and just swap the SIM or somehow transfer to eSIM 

I dont want to order from ATT because the only thing theyll do is ship to my house which I dont trust have had to many packages stolen   so Id rather just buy the iPhone 15 pay in full and if I have to carry it in person to the ATT Store to have them transfer my number  unless I can do all that at home

Ive done a lot of corporate iPhones this way just moving the SIM to the new phone but Id rather convert to eSIM if possible"
Well that too lol
Its funny because Bono even talks about it in his autobiography Basically apologizing and says thats not how the band intended for things to play out To be fair its definitely not their fault whatsoever Apple could have literally done anything to fix it
Mine was a 16 GB model and I was sitting at 13 GB before I got the album LOL

99 of our problems are first world bullshit Everyone should chill
I think biologically most of the things we choose to do are about being attractive to the opposite sex  keeping our genes going in the gene pool We do it subconsciously a lot of the time The clothes we wear what car we drive where we live our hobbies how we actshow up on social media Apple is a sexy brand their marketing is the best in the world  airpods make you X percent more attractive making music making art and editing videos on an iPad is cool and attractive to a lot of people A phone maybe less as there are so many to choose from now but for a long time an iPhone was actually exciting to people Owning apple products makes us thinkare were more creative and actually somewhat more attractive etc Im not just making this up its proven in research Obviously this isnt everyone but a generalization of brands Brands are powerful Im probably just slightly more aware of it as I work in design and advertising and Apple has always been the standard for producing creative work
can you give an example
I dont know a single person who has transferred data on their iPhone via cable in years The reality is the average consumer will never use this feature and the people who will use it are people who will likely buy the Pro anyways Not an excuse but an explanation
Yep Thank you lol This should not be locked behind what essentially is a paywall Its Apple not a small tech company without resources to make it happen
They innovate in ways to take advantage of people
"Ok but the base iPhone 15 cant even do it for a second 

How about the tons of cheaper Android phones"
I dont want to talk to you anymore Have a nice day 
"Is it really an excuse when its true Consider asking your parents or your nontech friends when was the last time they plugged their phone into their PC

" bro if that was the case they wouldnt have been so upset with the EU about enforcing usbc

When were they upset After the law passed they got asked about it in an interview and some senior president of something basically just shrugged and said they follow the laws of the countries they operate in"
But we had iPhone 7 and 7 Plus We were all happy with that We had 6 and 6 Plus all happy 8 and 8 Plus all happy It was fine just give us all the features on the phones like you use to and with the screen size and battery being the only differences The Pro stuff is some ass
For so long Ive wanted Apple to simplify on iPhone XX and iPhone XX Pro Or even IPhone YEAR and IPhone Pro YEAR Different sizes dont need different names people know whether they want the big one or the small one and how to select the size they want
"Pro Max always has different features than Pro 

Plus denotes larger size 

Max denotes maximum features 

Its quite simple dont know why you gotta get all mad for no reason"
That doesnt mean it shouldnt be available for what people pay for even the baseline phones not including the SE 120Hz should be included Especially when it is included on cheaper phones from other manufactures
Did you ask the millions of people that buy the baseline phone nobody knows if theyd care or not but for the price of the device it should be included
Wrong sub for blind Apple hate bud
How is that relevant The 15 camera isnt as good as the 15 pro
Yes same thing for me  a shame that apple still sells phones with 60hz they should at least go up to 90hz for the non pro models

Youre not wrong Fuck it I may have to go pro Ill miss an always on display as well so at least theirs that
Who is filibustering for iMessage The most likely thing is it gets earmarked with a bunch of pork bundled into it by legislators who see an easy popular bill
if 22 countries can coordinate better than USA with itself its such a big problem
Because Europeans have been used WhatsApp even before iMessage was a thing It was free compatible with BB iPhone and Android and over time a much better messaging app Chat wallpaper in chat search easy groups management you can port your chats to Android if neededand so on WhatsApp is much much better
And you can charge both watch and AirPods wirelessly anyway
Okay
why do you insist on engaging with someone who doesnt want to engage with you
The 14 pro is still a better phone compared to an iPhone 15
Mm Im not really arguing a lot of people are using it merely that USB3 has been the standard for years The A16 probably supports USB3 but apple deliberately chose to limit to USB2
Yes Its the first time I ever had a nonstandard color phone ie not black The second I saw the presentation I was sold
All you need to do to notice the difference on a PC is just move the mouse around quickly or move a window around and you will see a difference Especially obvious in things like FPS games if you have a high enough frame rate On phones it is possibly more obvious in normal use because it feels much smoother when scrolling or swiping around You dont have to stare hard at the screen to see it
"With trade in values for some of the more recent phones you can walk away with paying anywhere from 2300 bucks for an upgrade 

I have a 13 pro max that Im considering trading in just so I can sell it off at its potential highest resale price"
No need to explain them the will know once they will use it in real life They wont agree anyway Its something which can only be experienced
Its possible that it could change my mind but I also sit in front of a 144hz PC for like 8hrs a day
That is generally the point of a business Wont last very long if you dont care about profit
Same reason Apple used Retina even though some Android phones had higher PPI
hit the nail on the head plus better cameras means we are gunna get an hdr video of a ufo sooner or later right
The MP number really doesnt make a difference except to people that brag about spec sheets the sensor is so small it doesnt matter
Go be angry somewhere else  You arent owed everything you want by anybody
"Its like headphones once youve used and gotten accustomed to something better going back to entry level is disappointing People would probably also be fine with driving cars from the 70s had progress halted well look at soviet motors they did stick to 60s tech until collapse but nowadays nobody wants to deal with their problems

I was considering going IOS after getting used to an iPad but I definitely dont want my phone to feel that sluggish Shame since the hardware is easily strong enough"
ill never forget how excited i was to show people 120hz iphones at the store i work at that sells them most i got was oh thats neat
I didnt say androids are superior I have an iphone 14 pro and Im very happy with it My sister has regular 14 and the experience of using it is worse than my old A21 And that was a 300 phone in 2020 All thanks to 30hz on referesh rate Before you shit on it try actually using one its such a glaring difference
"From your own link

 Meanwhile some flagship devices like the Galaxy S23 Galaxy S22 Galaxy Z Fold 4 and others are scheduled to get five years of security updates

Nobody is arguing there arent other options available just that this option sucks for a phone that costs almost 1000
Using it right now Its a great phone
"Yea I was a Pixel fan for years and Nexus before that

There are two phones on the market for the discerning customer iPhone and Pixel"
Youre in an Apple thread asking about Samsung hate
"805 for a 1tb 14 pro max  
even tho they literally said in the presentation that iPhone holds value well"
We dont need hundreds of thousands for education or healthcare so we can afford it
Before before that The dumbphone days with their own proprietary charging connectors
lmao speaking for the entire planet like a typical redditor enjoy your outdated technology
Who needs those cameras Honestly no one needs that much camera and still their entire event is just about the camera
Being a pure apple fan with no thought of criticism must be nice especially when my point is not that theyre not including a feature
"These things live 99 of their life in the ambulances being used just like any other car charger The USBC cables live the same life

Edit HAHAHAHAHAHA you seriously blocked me because Ive said that USBC cables have lasted longer than lightning"
"Youve reached the right guy I used to work as a Mobile Sales Advisor for Best Buy 

Once you buy it unlocked and set up the iPhone itll ask you to transfer your SIM card to the eSIM of the new phone granted youre doing a full transfer This setup should be done automatically by the iPhone as they will do the carrier contact and transfer by itself 

You shouldnt need to go to a store to get situated And if you have issues come launch come back to this comment and reply or DM me 

The 15s will not have a SIM card slot in the US So the eSIM transfer will be necessary"
This can all be done very easily You can buy the phone unlocked and if you plan on trading in your old phone make sure you erase it Then you can contact ATT support and ask for your number to be added as an ESIM to your new phone They will most likely ask for some numbers from your new phone and then ESIM will be setup
LOL that is very cool to hear They could have just put a button in iTunes or something 
Technically the max rated power output of a USB2 port is 500mA or 25W Tablets phones etc have supported or even required more power than that since like a decade ago
Normally Id be all aboard the hate train with this one but except for transferring pictures Ive never needed to copy files tofrom my phone I guess thats why its reserved for the pro model
Yes because wireless has been faster than USB2 for years That was how Apple pitched airdrop But USB3 is far far faster that an iPhones wifi
they also dont make it easy lol I detest itunes
thats because no one would make it known that they tried transferring files I have tried transferring data from my 14 Pro via cable and gave up once I realized how slow it was
Hi I did  Copied my 40GB music collection to the phone
Wait it isnt a paywall though The chip in the iPhone 15 doesnt support USB 30 Its not like other cases where the hardware supports it but they just disconnect it and disable it in software
You too
"Again youre assuming that every nonpro iPhone user is a nontechie

You dont have to look far on here or on riphonehelp to see plenty of people having issues transferring a large number of photos or video over airdrop its fine for small stuff but not for the kind of things youd want USB3 for"
along with the law shouldnt get involved with businesses and just let the business sort itself out
"Counterpoint but money tho

If you dont care just ignore the pro line"
No business that is selling extremely well is going to dediversify their products
its cause pro max sounds like ass just call it max also many of the pro max models have not had any extra features over the regular pro
"I dont think you are wrong but price just really doesnt have a lot of bearing on luxury goods That is just an unfortunate reality 

iPhone doesnt compare itself to other manufacturers They only compare themselves to their previous phone People who want the iOS ecosystem are not going to consider android devices simply because they are better value for the money"
Youre right let me survey the millions of people then Im allowed to voice an opinion I just think most people that buy iPhones are casual users who literally wouldnt notice 
"Calling the 800 Iphone 15 a SCAM Blind apple hate You have a sheep NPC opinion

The 1000 Iphone 15 Pro is among if not the best phone at that price point There is no blind hate happening here Its not blind to look at a price point are realize that youre being fucking fooled into buying a phone model that offers notably less features over its competitors"
are we really arguing about priority 1 vs priority 2 rn lets just both agree we need to go outside and touch grass
Can you provide any evidence that higher refresh rate speeds up the degradation of the panel
"Theres barely any noticeable difference to begin with

Ive got a 120 Hz Android and a 60 Hz iPhone There definitely is a noticeable difference princess"
Or just get any samsung
IIRC earmarks went away a few years ago And the point being that its going to be damn near impossible to get 60 votes on anything regulating telecommunications these days
No shit Sherlock
" Mm Im not really arguing a lot of people are using it

But I am You ignoring that factor doesnt mean that its not part of the rationale 
  
 The A16 probably supports USB3
  
No It does not It would have to be bumped up to the A17 chip which would be a nonnegligible bump in price for a feature that practically zero people desire"
Same the first nonblackgrey Id had too
"Im saying I cant tell when doing that unless Im going out of my way to stare at the screen to notice something

Im sure some people can just not me"
Not when the feature was first released Apple was first to market with those kind of pixel densities
You got more MP you can crop to a usable 12 MP which Apple takes as a baseline
"Thanks for proving you have nothing to challenge my point 

Keep keeping those boots clean"
"Eh 

I value consistency and stability over latest and greatest  There is nothing I am doing on my phone that would benefit from 120Hz

but it looks better when I am flicking screens really fast

who cares"
I would rather have an extra hour of battery than 120Hz
I think he meant like 6 years of numbered full iOS releases not just security updates
LOL learn the difference between OS updates and security updates  Theyre not the same  If they were the same they would just be updates  But again youre talking about one Android vendor who is less than 25 of the worldwide market  The vast majority of Android phones dont even get that paltry level of support
Ive used both Samsung and Apple on and off for years At the end of the day theyre both phones They are 95 the same thing If there wasnt such a social stigma in America on using Android phones I would undoubtedly still have a Samsung
So you were a Pixel fan the brand with a shit ton of QA issues but disliked Samsung Makes sense
oh sorry didnt realize I wasnt allowed to like both
Is that what you want Why not get the regular 15 Never really understood people who always got the most expensive option
Like the 30pin connector used on the iPod and iPhone Im really not sure what youre getting at They all used similar proprietary connectors but everyone moved to MiniUSB in the mid 2000s then MicroUSB and eventually USBC while Apple stuck with the 30pin until 2012 when they introduced Lightning
"You are unable to accept that what you care about not everyone else does 

You need to learn that everyone else in the world isnt wrong to have a different opinion than you"
Whoa crazy Im glad I asked I will bookmark this Youd think I know this doing MDM for Corp  Gov organizations I just get a little more anxious about my own device and that phone number is where a lot of my 2FA codes go
"Thanks appreciate this  Ive transferred eSIM to eSIM before with the new way of just Hold the 2 iPhones near each other which was pretty slick  I just remember especially with corporate managed phones that old legacy SIM to eSIM was a bit more cumbersome 

I guess the nice thing in this type of situation  is my phonenumber continues to work on the old phone Im in no rush to wipe or sell the old phone

My ATT account actually has 2 iPhones on it w 2 independent numbers since I do MDM Mobile Device Management for a living So I think I have some duplication and fallbacks there if something goes sideways"
iTunes went away on MacOS a few years ago I feel bad for windows users still stuck with it
"I mean youre not wrong however if it is hardware limitation then thats on Apple to figure out They could just dump the A17 into the generic iPhone 15 too and call it a day while still not losing not even a penny But we know Apple and how they operate 

Same thing can be said for the 120hz display Its technically behind a paywall In this day and age theres no reason the standard iPhone should be limited to 60hz Even a sub 200 android phones offer 90hz And yet only the pro models that are over 1k offer higher hz display which is to say its behind a literally paywall lol 

This is fully my opinion and I know not everyone agrees with it"
" when did they say that

I think they offered some valid concerns about how the EU will evaluate the successor to USBC and the EU made adjustments to the law in response to that But once their concern was addressed they didnt really respond to the law at all other than changing the port on their phones"
Problem is the Pro line is siphoning features away from the regular iPhone
"If they only had the pro model i dont think they would sell nearly as many phones overall Makes sense to have a cheaper version for those who dont need all the bells and whistles 

Kind of like saying Mercedes Benz should only sell the S class They would be giving up a ton of market share"
Never said you couldnt voice an opinion just pointed out you made an assumption about the wants of millions of Apple customers without any evidence to support your claim
"I have a sheep NPC opinion I didnt even state an opinion yet youve deemed it a sheep NPC one Hilarious 

I didnt say you couldnt dislike iPhoneApple Calling a new phone a scam because it doesnt meet your standards is just a simple exaggeration No one is forcing anyone to buy an iPhone 15 Theres no trick or deception so its not a scam 

You like Samsung Congrats All I was saying is that youre not going to get much discourse and agreement in an Apple sub on the day the new devices are announced"
Youre the one that started it Its not really an argument youre just wrong
"lol gratz Now every 60hz screen you look at appears laggy to you Guess you better start upgrading your screens Keep consuming brother never stop buying

Meanwhile Ill be using my 5 year old iPhone with faster computing power than your brand new Android Dont stop buying those phones baby Enjoy those 2 security updates per lifecycle of the phone"
cool man Im saying USB30 is the standard it has been for years apple should be shipping with it thats really it
"Stability and consistency Hows that at odds with higher refresh rate If anything app dropping a frame is less of a deal 17ms vs 8ms until next frame leading to better consistency

I scroll a lot and lowered delay from touching to something happening is very noticable

Battery saver kicking in and forcing 60Hz is night and day"
"Which is irrelevant because updates dont work the same on the two platforms 

Theres a ton of update stuff handled by the Play Store services for example and you dont need a full system update just to update system apps like you do on iOS for some reason"
"They are 95 the same thing

Yep I can tell a lot of people here either used shitty Androids or not at all Apple has a bit more polish Samsung has a bit more features Everything else is pretty much the same Easy to avoid getting locked into either ecosystem"
lol you purchase phones based on perceived social stigma
It does indeed make sense if you arent a simpleton
Not what i want its the trade in value Ill keep with my 11 pro for another 2 years at least
Make sure for 2FA you transfer those to the new phone first before resetting the old one I recommend using Googles newer 2FA since its cloud based and not device based
"I agree that they can do it but its not like it wouldnt cost them anything They sell a lot of iphones Hundreds of millions 1 saved means hundreds of millions of  saved

Its something to consider still as a company and they made a choice Especially for the chip I wouldnt say they could drop in the A17 into the 15 for no cost They literally bought all of TSMCs supply for 3nm technology Even if it costs more money Im not sure if anyone would be able to make enough for Apple in time

Maybe with your definition of paywall you could argue about the display but certainly not about the chip"
"Their concern was  regulations can drive conformity across the different types connectors built into all smart phones and can freeze innovation rather than encourage it Such proposals are bad for the environment and unnecessarily disruptive for our customers 
anyone can read that and say apple doesnt want it If they were going to put usbC into the iPhone they wouldnt have even addressed this Companies always have some shit to say when they start getting regulated Apple probably wanted to avoid usbC all together and go port less but got blind sighted by the EU Again if apple really wanted to embrace usbC for their iPhones they would have done it when they started putting usbC into their iPad pros The fact that they didnt until now plus their statement only proves it was the EU that made them implement usbC into their iPhones even more Whether they did it ahead of schedule doesnt really matter"
I doubt they would sell the base iPhone for 799 with all the pro features
Why do I need evidence to just say what I think
" apple should be shipping with it

Nearly every iPhone user in the world disagrees with you on this But certainly its not you thats wrong  its the entire rest of the world right"
" and lowered delay from touching to something happening is very noticable

You arent getting things done faster   Loading is the exact same 

but you are just going to downvote so I am not continuing this conversation"
Yeah Im convinced this sub has never had anything other than an iPhone
A social stigma that affected my ability for casual hookups Yes I gladly took that trade
"Yeah only simpletons need to call 911 without their phones crashing

Yeah thats what I like about Apple products long lasting and good trade in values
"Dang glad you reminded me of that too I have some older SMS codes and I have about 10 accounts setup in Microsoft Authenticator my preferred as a lot of the work I do is Microsoft Azure based 

I also bought 2 x Yubikeys a year or so ago the 5ci version that is both Lightning and USBC so that should work no problem if the new iPhone is USBC Ive used my Yubikey recently to setup a new MacBook Pro and authorize my AppleID and it worked smooth as could be 

A lot to think about these days for Security P"
"And in the same argument youre using can be said about the display lol The new display on the pro is and AMOLED 120hz Ofc business it doesnt make sense to drop the A17 into the regular 15 because then people wouldnt care to spend the ridiculous asking price for the pro models And so my point still stands that the better hardware is locked behind a paywall 

As I previously stated Apple wont do any of that because we know how they operate They are extremely anti consumer and they are just as bad if not worse than Nintendo at screwing their customers and at the end of the day we all just eat it up Im guilty of it Up until the iPhone 12 I was upgrading every year Still have my 12 pro Max and isnt going anywhere at this point USBC its enough for me to care to upgrade at the moment Been considering going back to Samsung and trying out android again For the first time in 10 years The fold 5 really has been tempting me lol"
Id argue that we would have had a 120 Hz screen by now if we only had iPhone 15 and 15 Plus
You claimed nobody wants 120Hz in the base phones I merely pointed out that you dont have evidence for that It was a claim not an opinion
"Lmao thats not an opinion its a fact son Sorry you hate iPhones so much youll grow up one day Youre so hateful over phone preference Thats my whole pointhttpsredditcomriphonesVTargf3hCn

You know whats the real scam When you buy a nonPixel phone and it doesnt get new Android releases or security updates after a few years Thats an opinion"
 ok
"Not every touch requires something to load Id argue even most especially with todays hardware the screen limits a lot

I havent downvoted a single time untwist your knickers"
"Yea reliability and quality is part of why I moved to iPhone from Android devices thats right

Not sure why youre trying to defend Samsung in an Apple reddit of all places but youre allowed to be as undiscerning as you like nobody is stopping you from buying Samsung garbage"
I gotta get me one of those My YouTube was recently hacked and I need more security like that And I like more keys to jangle on my lanyard
"Honestly I dont feel like youre trying to have a open discussion because it really doesnt feel like youre even reading my comments If you dont want to buy it then dont buy it

Apple may be anti consumer but this is not the example of it They are very clear about what theyre selling There is no misdirection no stopping people from doing things with what they buy Are you going to call your local mom and pop bakery for being anti consumer because they charge more for a chocolate crossiant than a regular crossiant"
Would it be 799 though
I didnt say NOBODY wants 120hz I said most base iPhone users wouldnt care if there phone is locked at 60hz
If you think that going from 60Hz to 120Hz saves you time you are just mistaken
Its mostly just the fact that your experience was like using a 500 Windows laptop complaining that Windows sucks and switching to a 1000 Mac because its so much better If you have a good reason for disliking Samsung have at it but a Pixel is not representative of a great Android experience
"Its been on my list for a while that whole question of What if something unexpected happens to me and nobody can get into my accounts which actually did happen when the early Alphawave of Covid put me into the Hospital for 38 days 16 of those in ICU on ventilator Full story here if you need some afternoon reading httpswwwredditcomrAskRedditcommentsoi4b31h4t9dekcontext1

Soyeah since then Ive tried to be more diligent about redundancy The Yubikey solution works pretty great although I just moved crosscountry to a new city where I dont know anyone So currently I dont really have any human fallback option in case some emergency happens to me 

I do have a Rugged waterproof USB  so Im thinking of figuring out some way to hang a packet of information or a small In case of emergency box right inside my front door so on the off chance anyone has to break the glass they can read a note of instructions have some House and Car keys and info about my online accounts Still thinking this one through to find the right approach"
Im not sure There are plenty of smartphones with 120Hz at a lower price point Its not like it would have every single Pro feature
"In the comment I responded to and in your responses to mine you have not stated you thought the Pro was good  

You calling it a scam is blind Apple hate Theres no semantics Youre so mad over nothing bro lmao"
"It improves responsiveness by a significant margin Hasnt this been Apples mantra against both Android and Windows for years

Theyre nickle and diming customers to spend more on the Pro by withholding something 250 Android phones have"
"Pixel is the best Android experience if you dont understand why Im not sure why you would even consider Android

Ive also owned flagship Galaxy phones sorry"
" It improves responsiveness by a significant margin

It barely matters in twitchy FPS games  Its not helping your thumb click on something faster 

This is an insane argument for high refresh rates  The argument is It looks smoother Thats it"
"Oh yeah I didnt read the whole thing because youre fucking novel length Reddit comments 

I dont care though my comment was in response to you saying the 15 was a scam Its not a scam Thats all but you had to defend your honor because youre insecure"

Apple support is saying 8GB of RAM
Threedimensional amateur porn has arrived
"I was expecting 1300 on the Pro Max

The price is the same as the 256GB 14 Pro Max which I guess is raised compared to the small Pro but it could have been worse"
Did they really have to reserve the action button only for the pro models Lol
Was trying to convince myself that I needed to get the 15 pro max but apple gave even the stupid monkey part of my brain no plausible reasons to upgrade
I cant wait for them to release the best color mid cycle
iPhone 15 base model is actually pretty good this year for those that normally dont get the Pro models
And its launching at 999 Thats actually kinda amazing considering all the rumors earlier Good update overall imo but Ill hold on to my 13 pro for another year or two
Didnt they say during the keynote trade in up to 1000 Apple Store only goes up to 650
Must see colors  comparisons
Looks good as expected But yeah USBC was the most important Other than that Action Button and Dynamic Island were pretty fine
USB 30 with an optional cable
I wonder if the 15 pro max has 8gb of ram

Poor marketing team didnt know what to advertise so they talked about titanium for 10 minutes
I wish I could tell the difference between the colors Maybe some other videos will help soon To me it looked  charcoal grey and light grey plus blue I wish they had more fun colors for the Pro line
Did they talk about battery capacities of all the iPhones
The iphone now have more pc games than mac lol 
My 12 pro pacific blue lives on
Camera bump is well over half the thickness of the rest of the phone Bravo
The 14 Pro purple will always be iconic
Mega lame that theyre separating the camera between the normal and the max pro again

Are the bezels any smaller as was rumored
Price is reduced in Ireland and probably the EU in general from last year Starts at 1239 Euro The 14 Pro started at 1339 Euro The regular 15 is also cheaper
Many will hate but this is a day 1 buy for me After 8 years with Android and my last iPhone being the 5 Im looking forward to this one
these threads are always funny with people chiming in im still rocking my iphone 2 and I just cant find a reason to upgrade for these so called features Looks like I will wait yet another year to see if they finally innovate
USBC is so valuable Now you are able to hook up an SSD and film directly onto an external drive In terms of peripherals a game changer A shame that they only now got up with it
Absolutely ridiculous how the automatic switching to portrait mode is a hardware feature and not a software one If the standard iPhone 15 can do it then an iPhone 14 Pro should do it too as they use the same chip
I refuse to call these optionshttpspbstwimgcommediaF5169XkAAcL9wformatjpgname4096x4096 colours Theyre 4 shades of boring
"Im not seeing a lot of compelling reasons to upgrade over the standard 15 Someone help me out here if Ive missed anything

 Slightly faster processor

 Faster USBC data transfer

 Third zoom camera only the Max gets the periscope lens

 120Hz

 Titanium"
Heres hoping theyve fixed the ridiculous flaring and orbs on the camera
"Same starting price 999

only in US"
Ill keep my 13 pro until they bring periscope to regular pro I just cant use that 67 brick
Really trying to justify upgrading from a 13pro to 15pro or pro max I shoot a ton of video and photos so thats my justification but not sure if its worth the upgrade
"So its essentially a beefier 14 Pro which makes sense considering the smartphone climate these days Although as an amateur photographer and filmmaker the upgrades to the main camera sound pretty cool and like a good upgrade from my 13 PM The tele and ultra wide lenses still produced results that looked like they were taken from a smartphone obviously but hopefully you catch my drift and I personally dont care about the 5x zoom that the Pro Max has Ill probably go with a 256gb 15 Pro this time around as although I love my 13 PM the size of it has begun to rear its head in the past 2 years of ownership 

A much lighter and minutely smaller phone that still has a 61 inch screen sounds right up my alley for this year

EDIT The action button is cool but will be used as a mute switch still by me lol"
I am really hoping that they have finally fixed the camera hdr with smart hdr 5 Ever since the 13 iPhones really struggle with challenging hdr situations where it will blow out the sky and crush shadows Especially noticeable if you take an indoor shot in the daytime with a bright background which will get completely overexposed The flagship Android phones dont have this issue
They dont even talk about battery life anymore My 13 pro lasts only half a day so thats my only want to upgrade
Is getting the 15 pro max worth the 200 extra for just the 5x optimal lens The only time I use the zoom is for concerts maybe 1 to 2 times a year Although I really like taking amateurish photographs when going places Im stuck between the 15 pro or max I dont really care for the size but I prefer the 15 pro size Currently I have a 13 pro which Im trading
"Time to say Googbye to my iphone 8 for a 15 pro

Where are all the people complaining about them raising the price
"People underestimate what Apple is doing here And it works every time 

x200B

Someone said earlier today They would sell more iPhones by lowering the price instead of adding new features and they got blasted on reddit But when they pair up these sweet sweet trade in deals and things thats exactly what theyre doing 

x200B

Some years the trade is credit is 700 sometimes 800 and rarely its been 1000   


The first time I did a year over year upgrade was the super boring iPhone 7 which I couldnt believe ATT would actually give me for FREE after trading in my 6S 

x200B

This entire presentation I was like welp not planning on upgrading my iPhone 14 Pro Max but then at the end I go hmmmm Maybe I will 

If theyre going to give me 1000 for A 1099 phone I used heavily for 1 year hell I probably will upgrade 

Is it a huge reason to Nope But its not a huge price to either"
so does the 15 pro have all the camera lenses as well or only the ultra  35mm specifically
Kinda annoyed the camera is once again better on the Pro Max than the Pro
Nothing has me rushing out to upgrade my 12 Pro
"Why cant they use the normal colours with the pro Pro colours are always so boring

Past years havent been too bad I like the purple from last year But this year is so drab and the normal iPhone colours are great this year"
Anybody have info on charging speeds for the pro series
I wish the regular pro could get the 5x camera I want the camera but I dont want the gigantic pro max
Im surprised spatial video works with such a small distance between the camerasand with two different lenses entirely Looking forward to seeing how well it worked I was picturing future iPhones needing to have a lens on each side of the phone to get the same distance apart as our eyes
VR videos would be watchable with oculus quest23
The direct recording to an external drive will be fantastic
So Im hearing that the 15 pro camera is exactly the same as the 14 pro and pro max Besides maybe software improvements Is that true
Doesnt making any freaking sense updating if you have 13 or 14 series
"799 seems fair for the 128GB Base Model Most people that took good care of their old Iphone can also trade it in for a discount 

But it does feel like we are hitting a ceiling in how much a new Iphone can be improved The Dynamic Island is great and all but whats next"
Looks like they didnt increase the price contrary to what everyone was predicting again Not sure about other countries though
Natural titanium pro max for me LFG
Is the zoom 5x or 10x on the pro max When they announced the zoom increase during the presentation they said 5x but the spec list on the Apple website says up to 10x
Do we know if the charging speeds have changed
Im whelmed and sticking with my sweet purple iPhone 14 pro
"There is no big improvement over my 14 Pro Max so probably will skip this one

Edit Plus this purple colour rocks"
"Lol theyre not going to include a USB 30 cable are they The one in the box is gonna be 20 speeds so you have to pay extra

From the store page

Included in the box is a USBC Charge Cable that supports fast charging and is compatible with USBC power adapters and computer ports

Notice they specify its a CHARGE cable not a general USB cable Feels like a very Apple thing to do so Im just assuming youre not going to get the full 10Gbps USB speeds from the included cable"
"I love my 14pm and so far havent seen anything to make me upgrade but still watching

Edit 48mp heic is pretty good The file sizes are key which will make me upgrade"
"Im shocked the iPhone 15 Pro Max is about the same price as a 256GB iPhone 14 Pro Max

Actually upon looking at Apples websitehttpswwwapplecomshopbuyiphone you can no longer get the 14 Pro Max but ATT still has it available

Looking forward to getting my iPhone 15 Pro Max in a few months  Really dont need it until after the calendar flips to 2024"
I love my 11 Pro but Im all for a lighter version of this phone and that trade in value is prettyyyyy tempting
Is there already something known about the ram of the iPhone 15 pro
The blue Titanium is awesome
Does anyone have a good website that compares the differences between the pro and base    I see some on the apple site but Im debating if theyre leaving stuff out
"is the pre save available yet i didnt see it i tried to upgrade my IUP and it grayed out the buy option in the years past we could setup our checkout for friday

edit i just got a notification for it"
Should I upgrade considering I have a 13 pro max right now I was wanting them to drop that notch altogether before upgrading but that ray tracing technology is enticing me
Its lighter than my 11 non pro I will be getting this Hope I can get used to the shape though I like the 11s curves to hold not the blocky shape
If I am getting the 1k off through carrier in the Apple Store am I able to actually switch carriers inside the Apple Store or do I have to do that before
"Depending on verizons trade in promo Ill probably pick up a 15 plusthough if theyre good enough I guess i could spring for the pro max

I have an S23U though and cant even select that as an option on the trade in drop down lol"
No update on lidar 
upgrade to 15 just because of usbc and resident evil 4 mobile lol
"Probably going to upgrade 13 Pro Max  15 Pro Max because the battery on the 13 has taken a beating and full speed USBC for transfers of files 

Dunno if Ill go 256GB or 512GB the price difference in Canada is 300 "
About time
Meh
Any word on faster charging speeds with USBC
Is Canada still getting the iPhones with SIM cards I like to switch between Android and iOS and cant deal with esim
Why does the pro models always get the bland colors
One thing Id like to see with the action button is customization based on your focus mode For example in work mode the action button toggles DND or Voice memo fitness mode toggles camera etc That way users dont have to keep switching back and forth Hopefully they can add that as a software feature
And no fucking mini 
Lol such upgrades such innovation Give me a break The only reason they went with USB C was because of EU enforcing it Doesnt even have a 120hz screen but I guess they will say its Revolutionary once its being implemented on newer models
Guess Ill keep the 12 until iphone 16
48mp HEIF is all I wanted for this model so Im happy Only having it in raw mode and giving up all the processing made the sensor somewhat redundant on the 14 pro
"I want to upgrade from my 256b 12PM I take a ton of photos and videos but right now I am still only using  200 GB of 256 GB

Would a 512GB 15PM be overkill for me Since  I dont upgrade phones every year I was thinking to future proof but I dont know"
The upgrades couldnt be more underwhelming Glad my 13 Pro Max is still solid
"IPhone 14 Pro Max 1TB user here The USB and faster speed transfers is what makes this an immediate buy for me After that Id like to ideally not be on a yearly upgrade cycle 

I wish apple innovated more with the phone lineup like foldables This cycle was incredibly boring They have been boring for a few years now But my biggest issue has been charging in obscure places Theres always a USB C there but never an iPhone cable This would make things so much easier for me in the long term 

I dig the new 5x zoom But its the USB C future proofing for this round I wish they listened to their customers sooner instead of being strong armed 

Also a bit disappointed they didnt update the iPad I am in line for a new one as I think mine was still a launch 129 new design prior to the Mchips and its showing its age and battery health

Edit I should add I shoot cinematic video exclusively and work with RAW images in Lightroom from my DSLR Transfer speeds are abysmal currently so this is my rationale for the upgrade  not sure its a huge leap this year but it ticks the boxes"
Cant lie looks good this was the only real update even with the action button addition and has good color variants
deleted
Why does the Max version get x5 zoom and not the standard pro What if someone doesnt like big phones
Know everyones not a fan of the colours but I personally cant decide between the black or the blue
Are we ever going to get a model smaller than 61 again 61 is just so big and unwieldyI miss the smaller sized iPhones 
Cant justify the upgrade from my iPhone 13 Pro Ugh
No Always on for the iPhone 15 That is a joke right
And the crowd goes mild
Did it bother anyone else that theyre calling these titanium when they literally said its a titanium coating bonded over an aluminum case At least the stainless steel models have been stainless steel throughout
"Every year the comment section are just people dont seem understand that Apple only makes incremental improvements to their phone year by year and that people dont really need to buy a phone every 2 years like the 2010s

Unless youre a gamer I really dont see why anyone should be in a rush to be upgrading to a 15 pro especially if you still have an iphone 11 and up

You always have people expressing discontent about how Apple is imposing planned obsolesce but they try not to push out gimmick features every year to incentivize premature upgrades and in addition their hardware products somehow last 23x longer than the majority of competitors"
Titanium about to make this pricey
"Honestly these can be released every 2 years now 
Will probably make it seem like theres more of a difference between models by spacing the new models out too"
Guys 4 things I havent been able to find for the 15 Pro Max Ram screen brightness battery size and if it has wifi 6e Does anyone know 
Guess Ill be waiting one more year 
Looks like Ill be keeping my 14 Pro Max for a while
Looks like Im keeping my 1TB 13PM for another year
I thought the whole back was gonna be titanium Kinda disappointed its still glass
Is it just me or the event was underwhelmednot only this I feel they underplayed A17 by a lot even though named it proI was expecting a lot will be talked about 3nm chip as theyre the first one to do soalso it literally means better battery life but no mention of thatnot sure if it was just put together on the very last moment
Shitcanning the mute switch is the stupidest thing Ive ever seen an inventor do It is the perfect feature for a phone Nesting that back in software and menus is like going back to 2003 Nothing but navelgazing jiggery pokery from idiot managers trying to look busy
Im curious about the inclusion of a Thread radio on a phone Does anyone know what that could be used for Im big into HomeKit so Im familiar with how it could be used to connect accessories to your home hubs just not well versed in how it would be used in a phone
Upgrading from a 13 PM to 15PM
Was there any update to the camera or screen for the 15 Pro compared to the 14 Pro
Any info on weight yet
Honestly I can already see the Apple fandom actually start raving about the action button like its the best thing ever  it does look cool though
""
have the trade in prices really gone down iphone 14 pro max only 650
starts at inr1349001600 in india  where its being manufactured 
Has anyone else noticed that they software lock the normal 15 to USB2 Its such a petty move
"Apple can thank to European Union for 2023 revenue because the C cable seems like thats the actual upgrade this year 

Apple marketing is amazing I probably will buy upgrade this or next year regretfully I am still not sold much and I have 12pro max I was just hoping for more AI fix the Siri and maybe even better camera"
Ugh Im in love with the action button and usb c port as well as the colors but does anybody think its worth upgrading to the iPhone 15 pro max from the iPhone 12 Pro Max Or should I save my money this time around and wait a year  Not sure what to do as I love my phone but love the new features Whats everyones opinion
Jeez it only took them a massive court case in the EU to finally get with the times lol
"Pretty underwhelming thus far No battery or charging improvements No display improvements Camera on the pro are basically the same as 14 pro 

They literally just focused on the titanium and chip and carried over everything else from last year Not very apple like"
Nothing new Basically most of the features of the iphone 14 pro and they updated some stuff Really no reason to buy it if you have a 14 pro already Maybe if you want to upgrade from base model 14 because of dynamic island Could have just made the same presentation video as last time and just crossed out 14 pro and put 15
"I dont get it 

Why are yall so excited about USBC

If Im to upgrade and my wife doesnt  we now have a charge cord nightmare around the house A shit show when I go to friends houses and need a charge etc 

Why do you care What does it offer you currently that the lighting cord that has become ubiquitous doesnt"
Claiming that it has 7 lenses is stupid
Yawn
Is this thread a joke or full of Apple fanboys
Honestly barely care about USBC so this is very underwhelming Charging AirPods from the phone would be useful maybe once a year 15 pro is surprisingly lame
If my car is old enough to not have USBChow will I connect to CarPlay Will a USBA to USBC adapter work for the CarPlay protocol
Zero innovation Just the same as the last 4 phones but they changed the charging port because they were forced to
Im confused how do they make the bezels smaller yet its still a 61inch display The math aint mathing up
Kinda underwhelming biggest headline is a new material 
Was anything mentioned of thinner bezels
Does the pro model charge faster
"Hardly any practical upgrades from the 14 Pro

But my jaw dropped when they showcased the new GPU and sold this as a powerful handheld gaming device when they announced that RE Village RE4 Remake Death Stranding and Assassins Creed Mirage are coming to the 15 Pro

This is absolutely massive for iPhone gaming"
Rip No more 3x optical zoom on 15 Pro Max
The most boring iPhones ever I love Apple so much bit thisisboring
Same boring stuff each year Im gonna switch to the honor magic v2 next year Some real innovation
Hows the camera look
Tired of the same boring stuff Im switching to the honor magic v2 a proper innovation
Happy with my 14 Pro Max from last year Likely wont be upgrading
Apple really has everyone talking about focal changes as if the the lenses are physically changing or moving The power of apple What did they say 9 focal lengths in 3 Lol if I can zoom in steps shouldnt that count as well now
"So one of their main features is something they were forced to do

Slow clap"
We won mr stark let the usb prevail
I have a XS Max from 2019 Think the new one is a good enough upgrade My wife has a 13 Pro Max and it is heavy as a brick
If Im upgrading from a X is the 15pro processor and screen worth the extra 200
Literally copy and paste
iPhone 14 plus here likely wont be upgrading for a long time Its been a lot of copy and pastes with iPhones every year Not worth upgrading unless its a major improvement
Guarantee youll need a MFi cable to get fast charging
yawn
Stagnancy all around
Same shit different packaging Bahh bahhh sheep
Thank you European Union for dragging Apple into the 21st century
Honestly how can you sell a recycled product for 1000 for that amount its better to get a fresh product fresh materials from earths natural resources the carbon footprint discussion can be continued another day
omg so shocked
"Action button lighter phone better camera switch level gaming SAME PRICE and I can finally get rid of all my lightning cables is more than enough to get me to upgrade my iphone 12 pro Plus that potential 1k trade in makes it a no brainer 

99 of yall saying this is boring will never be happy lol To me this is the most significant update in years Last year it was just dynamic island and the year before it was just pro motion 

Its a day 1 buy no question"
"Although Im an Apple fan I really dont like where they are going with this iPhone Pro narrative The iPhone model is becoming more and more like the SE version 

Rather than the Pro being the superior version of the normalmainstream phone its starting to feel more and more like Pro is the normalmainstream and the iPhone is the inferior version"
Yawwwwwwn
Wonder how much we will get stung extra in the uk
So are the bezels smaller or nah
Why are people complaining about lack of USB 4 USB 3 is already a huge upgrade
Will it have a sim slot
Thanks Europe
Is there anything interesting besides usb c
Dont see any incentive replacing my 13 Pro for this
Imagine paying 50 for a cable
So hang on adding the action button hasnt actually made it more waterdust resistant
Still hasnt fixed that horrible camera bump
Why bother with titanium if it is only designed to last a couple years My glass phone has held together nicely with the aid of a case for 3 years now but the battery is shot and needs to be replaced already
Nononono Apple its moon stone or nothin
"Will they sell a USB C to A cable My car doesnt have USB C for Carplay fuck

EDIT Yes there are tons of it available in Amazon but these third party cables are really unreliable when it comes to Carplay sometimes they disconnect and you have to unplug and plug it in again multiple times to make it work but when youre using Apples it just works flawlessly for some reason"
We cant make our own posts here we have to link out to this dogshit site
Meh  everyone
Apple stock is down 25 today for a reason
Totally doesnt look like an iPhone 6 with the 14 Pros camera tacked on
Titanium looks horrible Just horrible
Compare page is uphttpswwwapplecomiphonecompare
Seems fine Not a big jump but a solid refinement Makes me start to wonder what really even could be a big jump at this point
what about the ram still 6gb
Scratch that On second thought I was tempted at first by the cameras here but Im just gonna keep my 13 PM for a while It offers practically everything Ill ever want and need out of a smartphone the cameras are still good enough and I have a DSLR to make up for its shortcomings I dont really need to play RE4 on my iPhone when I can do so at higher settings on my PC and Ive got lenses that offer more versatility and higher quality for my big camera I hope whoever gets the 15s enjoy them greatly though
How long does the trade in credit period typically last I have 6 months left on my current phone
If you go to the apple page the iPhone 14 Pro and the 15 pro will have exactly the same charging speed
Bit sneaky to drop the 128gb pro max model Adds 100 for those that dont need the storage and puts a 200 gap to the non max model
So European prices starting at 1229 euros but your tradein is capped at 830 euros How is the price higher and the tradein lower than in the US Someone enlighten me
Those who went from 61 to 67 do you like it
They should just make an iPhone thats specifically designed for shooting movies with at this point cuz they seem to push that a lotbut that also do phone stuff too Just stick the whole Sony A7RC full frame sensor in there at this point and one big 1 inch wide lens lol
When I preorder should I get it delivered to my house or get it in store Im not planning on trading in phones but I want to transfer everything from my old iPhone to the new one Is it easy to transfer everything on my own or should I go to store
This is awesome A titanium model  3D video eventually So cool
Hardware raytracing wasnt expecting this Hoping this to come to MacBook Pro soon
So aside from telephoto on the larger size is the 15 pro basically the same camera as the 14 pro
"Can anyone explain to me whether I will be able to connect a iPhone 15 to an ARZOPA portable monitor with a SINGLE USBC cable and achieve the following 

1 Charge the internal battery 
2 Mirror the iPhone screen 
3 Play video successfully
4 With audio coming through internal speakers 

Im sorry if I post this in more than one thread today but I really need to find out for work reasons

Help and advice will be greatly appreciated

Also Would it make a difference if I bought standard or pro models"
So any word on RAM Still 6GB for both models I guess
"Damnit was hoping for an even darker black color
Honestly from the ads it looks lighter than 14 pros black 
Gotta wait till I see it in store i guess"
The entire iPhone 15 line actually got cheaper here in Switzerland as did the Apple Watch Still expensive AF but at least not more expensive
"1 RingSilent switch to the Action Button  take something that works perfectly fine and redesign it for the sake of doing so With the current RS button I can easily tell its position at a glance During the conference I failed to notice similar functionality with the new Action Button

2 A17 Pro  does it mean there will be a nonPro variant as well If no why even bother with adding the Pro to the product name 

3 The GPU of A17 Pro described as the biggest GPU redesign ever seen in the iPhone history  and only 20 improvement in terms of performance Hardwaresupported RayTracing may come in handy I dont expect much though in the foreseeable future though

3 USB 3x as an exclusive feature for the iPhone 15 Pro Rather disappointing Syncing the iTunes library of more than 15GB of data takes a rather considerable amount of time with the USB 2 interface Bringing the USB 3x interface to the entire lineup would be definitely a welcome change

4 Showing HSR and GI as games making use of the new A17 Pro chip seems like a little failed attempt to me With all honesty I dont see MiHoYo updating their tech with one device in mind Of course I may be mistaken and the company may indeed bring some exclusive features to utilize the A17 Pro the Windows version of GI looks far superior compared to the mobile release even on the iPad Pro so I would assume that some selected features from PC might be added only with the A17 Pro in mind Still seems unlikely to me"
I wonder with the titanium case if you can anodise it like with knife scaleshttpswwwbladehqcombloghowtoanodizetitaniumto get different colours
Surprised battery life is the same with the 3nm Hoping we get some benchmarks and camera tests soon
Wtf the price in Europe is actually cheaper than the 14 Pro
It just seems like an unworthy upgrade to anyone with the 14 Pro line USBC was the best feature released out of the whole presentation The Camera in the regular 15 Pro would have been a better contender for purchase if they had kept the Max cameras with the same features as its smaller iteration
Did the screen get any year over year upgrades I saw the base 15 did but what about the pro
"This was a good showcase Reasonably priced lots of upgrades for the base model decent upgrades for the pro models as well

The watch was the weakest area  but Im not sure how much more they can do with it tbh I think even they know that given how they hold on to chipsets watch side for 3 years at a time"
"Can someone please help me decide on 15 or 15pro max

I am mostly concerned about the camera I dont professionally film for huge screens or youtube but I am trying to grow on social media and have been using iphone 12 pro max camera It has been working great but its broken I dont even know what telephoto means I watched the event but Im just not that techliterate I guess"
looks good still gonna hod onto my 12 pro max until its on its last leg
Does the titanium case make the screen more shatterresistant
I love the titanium but really whats the point when Ill never see it as there no way I can use the phone without a case due to the camera bump
Im upgrading from the Xs can anyone tell me if the pro is worth an extra 200 mainly for the camera improvements over the 15 when it comes to longevity I plan on keeping this one for another 5 years
Any reason to upgrade my 13 pro max Doesnt seem like there is
No price hike in promax in UK standing at 1199
can Iphone Max 14 Pro cases fit on the iphone 15 pro max Design seems the same and the it has the same display size
Surprised they didnt announce stage manager on the pro and the slow transfer speeds Should be at least 20gbps
"Really shocked at the price Looking forward to trading in my 14 Pro Max to get a 15 PM

Im stuck on the color tho My favorite color is blue so I typically always go for that but I fell in love with the Titan Grey"
Thats not black thats graphite Disappointed as I was thinking Id upgrade this year
Guess its time to retire the battery replaced iPhone 11 Pro for Apple Store credit and scoop up the AirPod 2 pro 2s
Is it 120hz 
No point in upgrading the 14 pro to this other than it being lighter  I do hate how heavy 14 pro is as I was coming from 12 mini best phonehorrible battery  And the usbc is handicapped i was hoping for thunderbolt so can connect it to a 5k monitor
My tradein would be less than what I currently owe through Apple Pay on my iPhone 14 Pro so I think Im going to get a new case instead and call it a day
Any idea if you can charge the iPhone over USBC while recording to an external USBC drive
Finally time to put my 11 Pro Max to rest
I love the black version of pro max I will 100 get that
Anyone find a review talking about if the watercolor autoedits fixed If so Ill upgrade else I think I may stick with my 14 Pro
iPhone nonPro had a great year and the Pro not so much from last year
I really hope the side button can be used for multiple purposes and not only that you can change from what they showed on the pictures Like you can either have silent mode or camera  but both in different button push
When is iPhone 16 release date 
The Pro colors look really nice but Ill pass I think Ill stick to my 14 Pro Max until the 17 or 18 Pro Max
I dont see colour options These 9to5 articles are pretty trash
1200 for pro max is fine The higher quality materials and brightness are nice My s21 ultra also launched at 1200 and doesnt have that People forget that other phones are also at that price with less material quality
What happened to thin bezels
Aight Ive got an 11 the battery is shit do I just bite the bullet and go pro
"I think my iPhone 13 Pro is safe for another year Just changing the battery and thats it 

I am pretty disappointed that for the best zoom you need the pro max I am not a fan of big phones"
I owned an Essential Phone for 3 years it had a titanium body it became kinda rusty after years of use wonder how those iPhones are going to hold up
I got the Iphone 6 plus finally ready to upgrade guys
Nothing amazing but its time to trade in iPhone 11 Friggin battery is shot
Of course the Pro gets USB 3 speeds while the base model doesnt You wanna save a couple  well heres USBC but with lightning speeds
Sorry Apple Im still broke Better luck next time
How significant of an upgrade is this if I currently have the 12  Literally USBC is the biggest reason for me to consider but everything else still doesnt feel different enough
Thunderbolt support
If the body is titanium could you get the natural and then anodize it to the color of your choice
Is the screen still flat or is it curved now I cant really tell from the images I know the titanium frame is slightly contoured But a curved glass display would be much more fragile
"Any knockout feature differences between the Pro and Pro Max this year RAM differences no 5x zoom display brightness differences etc

If its all exactly the same Im getting the smaller model but every year Apple seems to pull one major specsheet gotcha to make people go for the Pro Max model over the Pro"
As an SE user life is hell I wish I never broke my IPhone 6 a few years back
Really struggling to see the upgrade from 14 but I usually wait 45 years between upgrading
Was hoping the new colour would be a bit more dark grey although photos probably arent doing it justice Blue is the one to get I guess
Do they not offer product red anymore
Cant wait to see the titanium models
Will stick with my 14 pro max at least apple made it easy not to spend more money with this full upgrade when the main selling point is the fact its essentially plated with titanium they really have run out of ideas
Just so I get this done correctly I preorder from apple and then select finance through my carrier then take my old phone and trade in at a carrier store I am looking to take advantage of the bill credits
Weird choice in the current global climate and costs to manufacture They must be sourcing that titanium for dirt cheap and I wonder where that might be coming from
usbc will make me get off the fence and upgrade for the first time in 6 years
Does anyone know if it will accept more than 30w charging since it uses typec
Do we know if the spatial video playback in a special way on the phone like uses gyroscope to tilt or only for making headset content
Is the white models glass back actually white this time instead of silveryish
The iPhone 15 could have been the best model in a long time if it had 120Hz Apple just really had to make it have some flaw
does anyone know how much less would the trade value be if my 14 pro max has one small dent on the side of the phone the max is 650 if its in good condition
Wondering if this is a good time to upgrade phones I have a iPhone xs currently
I like the colors better on the non pro a lot more 
"iPhone 15 Pro or 15 Pro Max Please Help me decide 

Current phone iPhone 13 Pro

Current complaint Battery drains so quickly Have to charge before coming home from work 

Current con The screen is a tad bit small for me"
So the different focal lengths on the main camera are basically just digitally zoomed
Booooring
I wonder how theyre going to justify nextgeneration portraits not coming to iPhone 14 Pro The new base iPhones have the same sensors as the 14 Pro and the same A16 Bionic processor There will literally be no real hardware different for the relevant components and I dont remember this being a software feature as part of iOS 17
Usb C  EU for the win Replaceable batteries next
Anyone know if the LiDAR was improved upon as suggested in the rumours
Ive always stuck to the pro model lineup this year seems a bit hard getting convinced to go pro as opposed to the regular 15lineup
This looks great I personally love all the colours especially the natural titanium Wont be upgrading from my 14 Pro as I love this one too much Wish they gave the phones bigger batteries and also have the same cameras on the Pro and the Pro Max Otherwise good stuff
Is this an S year Whats the new cycle
Gonna get the promax just because the dividends pay for it Otherwise I will keep my 14pro Max
I got the white 14 Pro because I wanted the shiny frame Im disappointed that there arent any shiny iPhones anymore
Clearly coloring titanium is proving to be a problem
new action button shouldnt replace the silent toggle switch rather it should be a separate button beneath the power button
What is even the point anymore Nothing changes
Whats the button under the power button
"the action button seemingly only working for one action is a huge bummer if it had a double tap triple tap etc for multiple functions thatd be amazing

maybe even if it was somehow a mix between a physical button  and haptic capacitative button that way it wont accidentally trigger in your pocket from pressure"
Was really hoping 120 hz would have trickled down to the base models this year Ive been itching to swap out my 14 pro max due to its godawful weight
Phone innovation really has stagnated hasnt it like these are cool and everything but other than better battery life and better cameras what else can they do
Do I upgrade from my 12 pro max or hold out another year
iPhone 12 Pro homies yall upgrading Im thinking about it my battery is going to shit and my camera has a crack Features are boring but I do like the neutral color
"phoneI still find it wierd that it is impossible to buy an iPhone Macbook and iPad all in the same colour Right now I have gold  copper macbook air and i love it Seems like a reall strange ommision to me 

Also why cant the iPhone output to a second screen like the mac does The hardware is clearly capable"
The pro version has usbc 30 vs the regular 15 with version 20 Big difference to those it matters to
So will the 15 Pro have 05x ultra wide 1x main 2x main  48MP cropped and 3x telephoto
" The new iPhone 15 Pro also features the rumored Action button in place of the mute switch

Apple has ZERO idea what I want"
Love to know if they got rid of that camera filtering effect or included a way to turn it off somehow I have an 11 Pro which still takes realistic photos need to know if its still worth holding onto
Does that titanium texture look like a perfect hiding place for bacteria
 Will the pro max titanium white look decent I cant tell from the pictures The shades of grey seem so common I want something different this time
PUTS
The only major change is 5x telephoto on Pro Max models
Probably the most subpar update weve seen yet Im on the jump program with TMobile but I see no reason to jump from my 14 pro to this Which is fine I wasnt going to regardless But theres NOTHING grabbing my attention about it this year I actually dont like the new action button either I like being able to feel FROM my pocket if my phone is on silent or not No need to look
Yes you will be mine
Wasnt going to upgrade but seeing that it can take 3D photos and video Im going to jump on it as soon as I can
I have a 1TB 14 pro max Should I do it and upgrade I dont think I should but I think I might
Why they say main sensor is bigger but we get 48MP with 12um  24um like past year
Do we think there will be an ultra next year I got a 250 gift card and am debating upgrading from my 13 pro but maybe Ill wait a year
Still waiting on a Touch ID sleepwake button
"I got a 14 Pro last year so this isnt really for me although it would be nice to get USBC and the titanium chassis does look cool Also the slight change in the edge profile weight and bezel might make it that much more comfortable to use I typically upgrade ever 34 years but Im thinking Ill probably end up pushing that forward to get an iPhone 16 Pro next year

iPhone updates are less interesting than they used to be and Apple knows it but all the little refinements do add up over time too I enjoy using my 14 Pro more than the 11 that it replaced even while the core experience is very similar"
Before each Apple event Im telling everyone Im not buying the house 3 Pros this year well make do and tighten our belts 30 minutes after Apple Event finishes Im on Apple Store App pre ordering 3 phones 
My apple car play is a little old My phone needs to be plugged into the usb port for it to work Wont work via Bluetooth With usb C work the same way Will it transfer data Or just charge TIA
I have the iphone 14 pro max and not a huge fan of the camera which is why I got the pro it seems to be blurry mroe than any iphone ive had I am getting the iphone PLUS in pink I am hoping I can still use my iphone 14 pro max cases lol
Wow my roommate and I both got online at 5am and I got one delivering the 22nd and she isnt getting hers til oCtober I must type faster 
I was dumbfounded when I learned there wasnt any upgraded fast charging since they went to USBC I guess they cant give us all of the upgrades in one year or they wont have new features the next year lol Absolutely insane This iPhone is hardly any different than my iPhone 13 Pro Max
"50 shades 

Edit my first ever award is for this pos comment Im never gonna live this down"
I swear the leaks said there would be a silver  Is that the Natural Titanium
Im one of the minimalists that it appeals to but Im especially excited for a raw brushed finish option because it will make it super easy to buff out superficial scratches on my own with the right wire brush
Me too And the pink I really like is reserved for peasants only iPhone 15 not a pros 
"Ive loved all of the Pro iPhones but Ive always hated all of the color options I just buy silver because its neutral but if they ever gave us a bold color I would ditch my silver iPhone in a heartbeat

After seeing the gorgeous colorinfused glass on the regular 15 I was so excited thinking they would finally bring us some good options on the 15 Pro Sadly I was wrong and this was probably the most boring year of Pro colors ever Nobody asked for a third shade of gray and a dull navy blue is the most blah color there is Im really hoping they listen to customer feedback this time around and offer at least one bold and exciting color for the 16 ProUltra"
Mine goes in a case anyway couldnt care less
50 shades to pick from
Apple making it easy to switch to android
Yeah the colors across the whole line were underwhelming Boooo
I mean black and white are also shades of grey
Im glad I like the blue
Have the grey its more sophisticated
I wanted to buy the pro but hate the colours
And to wait to buy since they like to surprise launch new colors in 6 more months
Really That would be nice
"This will be the only deciding factor for me as I believe apps shouldnt randomly close on smartphones in 2023

Edit missing word factor My mind drifts sometimes lol"
They said that to me at a dinner
My uncle who works at Apple confirmed it as well
Did you read it anywhere
If theyre really going to put Resident Evil and Assassins Creed on that thing they better
"My wife is getting a Spatial on September 22nd

Edit Dammit 

Spatial video capture available later this year 

You win this round "
"Im surprised people are not hyped about the spatial cameras but I also wonder what the format of the recordings will be 


Will I be  able to record a video and then watch it on my oculus quest in 3D
Or will this be supported only by apple pro vision"
But youll need a Vision Pro to watch it I dont think it will blow up until theres an affordable version of the Vision Pro
I am really curious how they plan to combat porn on Apple Vision Pro because we all know damn well there will be people developing for that Could they even limit it  With side loading looking more likely I wonder if they will find a way to protect AVP
I didnt get to watch the presentation given that there arent two cameras on the back spaced eyedistance apart Im assuming theyre doing this computationally Im skeptical that it wont look uncanny and artificial
huh
they can run for political office in Virginia
The prices have also come back down in the UK 999 starting price and the 256GB Pro is 1099 again down from bloody 1209 I think the iPhone 13 Pros started off at 949
Honestly Im shocked at the price The Pro and Pro Max are much cheaper than I expected Compared to how everything else has drastically increased in price its nice to see Apple not increasing the price
Considering I was going to get a 256GB 15 Pro Max model anyway this is a win for me
"No price increase for USD but its at least a 50 increase for CAD

1699 for 256 and 1969 for 512 Now 1749 and 2049 respectively"
"Thats how they get you by ditching the 128gb model lol

With 5G Im fine with cloud storage so its a bit wasted for me

Makes it a 200 upgrade for the max model instead of 100"
"The games they showed will fill up the 128gb model in no time 4k recordings as well 

Base storage should have been 256GB but when you look at the fact the IPhone 15 pro max is so close  it almost feels like an up sell

The only real choice to make is do you want the standard 61 inch screen with less battery or the 67 inch with more battery

Edit  forgot the 3x vs 5x telephoto"
I also am surprised how Apple can be reasonable
The 14 Pro Max is now worth 650 in trade in though
Converted the Pro Max is 1591 in Europe Thats a mega difference ugh
They wanted you to expect that it costs more so youll forgive them for no reason at all and then you will be okay with them raising the price a year later
Euro prices are 100 cheaper
Yes so they can introduce it to the iPhone 16
That was the rumor for the longest
New features are generally introduced on the pro models first
Pressing a button is never going to be as satisfying as flipping that ringer switch I hope it stays a pro feature and leaves the regular lineup alone
What do you expect feom Apple
customizable button being marketed as revolutionary technology lol Wish the slide was kept
Well I am getting the Pro for the functionality but like the pink or 15 and the standard bottom for silent mode Maybe o just get the 15 
Where is the mute button
Also unable to configure it to multiple actions is just dumb
maybe just accept that when youre not buying the top end phone youre not getting every feature theyre gonna differentiate it somehow
My Apple dopamine recepters are simply burnt out
Same except USBC and thats because everything else is already using it now that I have and itd be one less thing to worry with
Didnt they not release a mid cycle Pro color this last year
"Whatchu thinking The forest green 13 mini almost made me upgrade But buying a phone 1 year after my last is against everything I stand for so I didnt The green was still cool af tho

To my knowledge we havent seen a burnt orange yet Something like the Daytona Orangehttpswwwcorvsportcomwpcontentuploads20201002b6affb828b215a24b52558fa229cfc11400x888jpg on Corvettes could be super cool

It sucks that phones are like cars where everybody has boring as fuck blackwhitegrey sedans Wish the world had more color"
Where was that rumoured scarlet red colour Now THAT colour looked nice
Green titanium would be a hit
Didnt do it last year
I wonder if thats when theyll drop gold this time
Id say its good enough even for older Pro users Im going from my 12 Pro to a 15 Plus Ill get a bigger screen but get to keep mostly the same features 2x optical zoom being the main one
Better off getting the 14pro instead
No action button tho Definitely need pro for that essential feature
Yeah its crazy how much better the phones got and the prices stayed relatively the same Im still rocking my 8 for the past 6yrs or so which cost me the same amount as an iPhone 15 I think its time to upgrade
Thats what Im doing for my gf who wont care about 120hz
Too bad no Spatial video on it even if youre not buying the 3000 vision pro it would be nice to have for possibly in the future or putting it on a cheaper oculus headset
Clearance iPhone 14 Pro with the 120Hz screen seems better than 15 base unless Im missing something
The base models are always good They just lack the shiny and camera
Will probably get 15 for my wife and Ill get her 14 I was using 7 plus until now  time to pull the trigger
I am planning to hold onto my 13 pro also unless there is a really enticing trade in offer I upgraded from an iPhone 7 to 13 pro through Best Buy and only had to pay 150 If a similar offer comes for the 15 pro I might upgrade Probably not though Most trade ins now have some bill credit component which I dont like
"They prob woulda got raked over the coals for a price increase with next to 0 updates 

They semi slid one on there with the pro max base now being the 256 gb model and making the telephoto lens only available in the pro max"
Aaaand they have now anchored the price in your mind and the already expensive price is now okay in your mind due to the raised expectations
" Thats actually kinda amazing considering all the rumors earlier

Annnd thats why companies spread fake rumors about their own products"
Yeah Im tempted to upgrade from my 13 Pro as well but if Im being honest it still runs very well and the USBC action button dynamic island better cameras titanium finish etc arent enough to justify the cost at this point
Right absolutely underwhelming Was preparring to justify upgrading before the keynote but doesnt look like I have to anymore
I paid for the monthly fee to upgrade my phone so I guess Ill just upgrade it but to me it doesnt seem like anything fucking new
They are roughly 10 cheaper in my country then previous models launch
its so funny that every year theres always a rumor that the starting price WILL ABSOLUTELY increase by 100 Every year theyve been wrong so far lol
Before taxes can you americans start to talk about the reality pricesits insane that this is ruled by law in the EU while you are getting fd over by fake prices
non reason to upgrade very minimal changes
They actually lowered European prices which I wasnt expecting Granted that mostly shows how insane starting at over a thousand euros was for the 14 with the same chip as the 13 and no dynamic island
It was all mind conditioning We should have a price cut instead
I fail to see whats exciting about this years iphone pro Better camera better for gaming and thats about it They didnt mention better battery life or anything else thats new except for the titanium which really doesnt matter that much if youre putting a case around it
Thats carrier tradein deals usually with more restrictions like staying on X plan for a time period
"Carriers lock you into 36 month terms and if you decide to upgrade in a year or two youd lose all of the remaining credit 

Apple Store gives you the credit all up front"
Thats carrier trade in values for the 1000
I think carrier trade in
The extra will be added via bill credits from your carrier So Apple gives you some credit up front and then you get a monthly credit from your carrier for the next 24 months as long as you maintain an eligible rate plan
Im hoping bestbuy has a good trade in deal this year My 13 is paid off and I want to upgrade to the 15 pro
sorry couldnt watch until the end Whats new about dynamic island
kinda wished theyd dare to make the action button orange or smth
Dynamic island is dogtrash
Starting at 4999
Pixel and Samsung also dont ship with a USB 30 cable They are less flexible and not ideal for daily charging
"You ever seen those cables They are thick and more importantly stiff

Given most people will use the cable for charging only I think it makes sense to give people a cable that works better for that use case

Not everything is a grand conspiracy Products are about trade offs"
"They are not charging cables They are data transfer cables and they are FAT

Virtually nobody needs them despite the crowing"
And its not locked to model All models with a USBC port get USB 30 If so good
Pretty normal
Serious question In what everydayuse applications would I need this optional cable Video photo transfer to a computer Anything else Im just excited Ill be able to charge my phone with the same cable as my Mac and iPad finally
"Ye kinda disapointed not even 32 or 40
Apple introducing 30 2008 tech in a 2023 product thou "
Apple bringing year 2000 to your footsteps what else can you want from a company
Theres always a catch
Am curious why they went with USB 3 and not 4 like they have on the iPad Pro
"httpswwwapplecomukshopbuyiphoneiphone15pro67inchdisplay512gbnaturaltitanium

addenum 6 at the bottom confirms the cable in the box does not support those speeds"
"I think the most depressing thing is that USBC HDMI adapters from Apple are not on the iPhone 15 Pro accessory page

So I have a really strong feeling that if you wanna plug into your TV youre gonna have to use a Lightning dongle and use the Lightning HDMI adapter which is

I mean why send out a clean DisplayPort signal when you can just encode everything to H264 and have a decadeold H264 decoder cable shit it out to your TV

I was wrong Ive never been so happy to eat crow From another redditor

"Chinese vendors on Amazon 
editing the listing of shit cables with IPhone 15 iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 pro max  I pad  "
Someone in another thread said Apple Support told them both the 15 pro and max has 8gb
Both Pro models have 8 gigs
Im hoping the regular 15 Pro has 8GB of RAM
they said it was larger didnt they
It gives them more time to refine this sensor in software imo starting over every year doesnt make sense
"Im trying to figure outdid they remove the macro capability on the Pro

Because if soholy shit  I was thinking about upgrading this year for the camera and that was a huge draw going from my 13 I love closeup photography but I am not moving to Pro Max size for that

Just for anyone else wondering the Specshttpswwwapplecomiphone15prospecs say that both cameras have Macro  Weird way they tried to make it sound like Macro was unique to the Pro Max in the presentation though"
Not everything is going to be upgraded every single year 
Yea nothing changed in camera departmentI think this year is all about 3nm a17 chip but they didnt do a good job of putting out the detailsnot sure why
"The best part is this years iPhone is the same price as last years  I only upgrade every 5 years but I may have to trade in my 14PM

Thats all the marketing they need imo lmao

Edit in addition to USBC ofc Its the main reason I wanna upgrade in the first place haha

Edit2 well Id be losing 1000 after less than 1 year of use for my 14PM 100 bat health if I trade it in so never mind "
Lets go over why titanium is titanium to pad the runtime
Just watched their official 4 minute advert on YouTube and I thought it was a joke It was surprisingly lackluster
So true I dont even see how this is an upgrade
Natural is the most interesting one here Seems to shift from midgrey to bronze with some green mixed in there
The pastels for the 15 look pretty enticing to me
I think the last color is confusing everyone Its supposed to be the natural titanium color So you have the dark gray the silver the blue and then the titanium color
Why do they think professionals dont want to showcase their personality with color The dark purple and green from iPhone 11 were the best colors
They all look the same to Chang too
Im having the same issue I was planning on the white because initially I couldnt even tell what the natural was brown gray but Im starting to lean towards natural now because Im not digging the white as much as I thought I would before seeing more pictures
They never mention capacity Only say longer battery life compared to previous iPhones if its longer
Apple has never talked about battery capacities
I checked the tech specs and apple is giving the same hours of playback for video and music as the 14p
12 Pro here too Every year the updates are just so vanilla No need to upgrade My wife got the 14 pro last year and the honeymoon phase with the dynamic island was over within a couple of hours
Physics isnt too accommodating Ill take it honestly
Dont worry you have a case that absorbs the bump to a flat level
Considering how annoying the pump already kind of is I wonder if there would be any pushback just making the entire phone thicker to make it flush with the cameras Fill the space with batteries and sell it as a 96 hour battery life or something
Just make the rest of the phone the same thickness already and give me a six pound iPhone with a week long battery life
"I dont get it Samsung flagships cameras are as good as the iPhones but their camera bumps are not anywhere near as huge as the iPhone Apple seriously does not get called out enough for this 

I am on iPhone 11 Pro Max and was ready to upgrade last year if not for the obnoxious camera bump This year it gets even bigger Wtf"
no surprise there
wish the camera bump was gone
Is there a periscope finally
As someone who doesnt care much about the camera quality I really wish theyd have a model with a smaller camera that was flush with the back of the phone
Never forget the Sierra baby blue
Too bad my battery blows on it thinking about upgrading just for that
Holding onto mine until it breaks
The purps hit different
Love the purp skurp
I love my purple pro max
I will not upgrade until the pro lineup gets better colors for this reason lol
The green 11 pro will stay in my heart always 
Sadly that 120mm looks really good But having a bigger phone is no option for me
I hate when they do that  I still have incredibly fond memories of the X because it was the only iPhone in years that was topoftheline everything without the size
Yeah was just thinking this I prefer a smaller phone but I guess they needed a way to justify buying the beefier pro
Physical limitations
Seriously The only upgrade from 14 pro to 15 pro is a titanium case which should mean its stronger And thats it Lol
"And when they changed the  plus  name to the  max  name iPhone XS Max introduction they told t was because Plus means more features 6 6s 7 and 8 Plus  better camera system and now that the only difference is the size since XS Max they would name them Max

So it should be iPhone 15 Pro Plus"
What do you mean by that I missed that part
Its size limitations The rumours are that the smaller 16 pro will get the 5x telephoto next year but it will increase to 63 inches to accommodate this 16 pro max will also increase to 69 inches
How else to distinguish Buy pro if you want better camera Its the selling point That being said I hope the new camera in pro is as good as Samsung or close
MAX pro is where it is at
Whats the main difference aside from the 5x zoom
Wait what The Pro doesnt have the same camera as the Pro Max
I spend 4 nanoseconds looking at your picture reduced to a 2inch square size
They are 100 cheaper in Denmark Last year a Pro Max with 256GB was 12499 DKK and this year its 11799 DKK
Might be currency related in Germany the new 15 Pro Max 256gb is the same price as last years 14 Pro Max 128gb cheaper than last years 256gb
AUD succcccksss right now  
Aussie dollar has shit itself in the last year though hasnt it
Yeeeah that was a pretty bad demo They could at least have chosen a pretty scene instead of that
They were showing a game developed many months ago and nothing has been developed for iPhone Pro MAX they just like to show big titles and have the devs claim they got to optimize their game for the new hardware
"Ray tracing  RTX

RTX is Nvidia branding"
At least the resident evil games looked nice Plus death stranding and the next assassins creed are releasing for iPhone which I never though would happen
lol
yes
Sounds like they opted to make the physical dimensions of the phone smaller rather than have significantly thinner bezels I was really hoping to see ultra thin bezels Need to see a comparison to know for sure
Hop over to NI for a day trip and you could get it for 75 euros cheaper
Im on the X and am finally ready to move on lol
"People dont understand that Apple isnt really trying to entice someone who bought last years device so much as to entice folks like you that havent upgraded in awhile 

People buy a device every year with incremental upgrades and complain about having to split the hairs to feel justified for making a purchase they werent compelled to make to begin with"
Oh exactly the same with me iPhone 3gs until the iPhone 5 been Android ever since Going for a 15 Pro Max now because of USBC
I think most hate is people like me who are on the subscription plan This is the first year Im not feeling like Ill get a value add from moving up For reference Im on the 14PM Spatial Video is cool for sure but its clear its a 14S phone not a true 15 Starting to think about hopping off the yearly upgrade wagon
yeah this will be my first iphone after 10 years with android and Im excited about it Kinda disappointed that this model is the same but slightly better and has no cool new features but the whole thing is going to be new to me so its all good
"People can justify not upgrading from their phone last year last last year or 3 years ago and thats fine

This was a day 1 buy for me and its because I really need to hand down my 12PM to replace the previously handed down 8 Yep that thing continues to survive on its sixth year as a daily phone"
"i might hop over from a pixel 6 whose summertime performance is pissing me off daily and i dont see future pixels getting better in the nearfuture

however i bought the pixel after a few frustrating months with an iphone 12 pretty bad camera and a lot of apps were just surprisingly buggy i hope it was just a lemon or a bad generation of devices and this will be more reliable"
"No fucking shit this is a big upgrade for you 


Youre on an Apple forum Its like commenting on a high end car forum that youre coming from a Hyundai sonata and its exciting for you"
On the iPhone 11 and its really tempting to get the iPhone 15 pro max and use it for the next 46 years With a battery change every 23 years I can really see this iphone lasting way longer than my iPhone 11
"Same situation here although Im moving on because my OnePlus 7 Pro is no longer the champ it was

Oh and because its cameras are terrible and I want dope pictures and videos of my dog Thats the main reason"
Ive never owned an iPhone but USB C was the last thing holding me back from trying
Enjoy
Same going from Android to Apple after a long hiatus Ive always been a Samsung guy but I hate the direction theyre going with their phones nonrounded corners useless Spen etc Their new buds and watches have been underwhelming too
"I think with the intro of usb C it actually made it feel more practical imoI dont see a lot of iPhone users where I live so getting a lightning cable is hard  I disliked iphones for the proprietary stuff its nice to see some of it being droppedthanks EU commission

I might switch from my S20 FE to the Pro"
Same My pixel 3XL can finally rest
Same Ive been using Android for 5 years Im going to plunge and get a Pro airpods and a watch
what kind of android do you have
Why would anyone hate that you are deciding to buy a phone Reddit is so weird You dont need reddits approval for a purchase and anyone who doesnt want it thats fine also
Same here Im on a 12mini and its time to move on I LOVE the size but the battery has just been abysmal
I am still using Android however I really understand the frustration especially after seeing high end Androids in action  Even Samsung S22 is problematic  Eg lag when it boots and entering PIN or even incoming phone call UX
Nothing to hate if you held out for so long A welldue upgrade if you ask me
The opposite is a person who wants to have latest model every year just for social status and justifies the purchase with all the amazing processor speed and such yet use the phone for social media And Apple knows this
Are we sure the iPhone will be able to straight up connect to an ssd card
And only because they got sued lol
Are we sure thats the case If so disappointing
I was actually wondering if this will mean they will not be Live Photos Because if thats the case thats a deal breaker for me I will never upgrade lol
"That and the 48MP HEIF Absolutely artificial

EDIT I was wrong iOS 17 RC shows that 48MP HEIF HEIF Max is also available for the 14 Pro"
"Im satisfied as long as theres black and dark blue

Though nothing thats clearly white gold or pink is an interesting choice especially considering gold would probably sell them more gold Watches and Milanese loops

Edit Theres very clearly a White Titanium model but the keynote basically never showed the back of the device only the edge so I thought that there were was a colour very similar to Natural Titanium"
I like darker boring Im sure many will want dark boring or less dark boring
I kind of like the lighter colors tbh Ive had too many greyblackslategunmetalmidnight phones
I think the natural titanium is beautiful and classic Slightly golden Thought I would be stuck on colors but thankfully they made it an easy choice for me
"I think Apple is also disappointed in them tbh

barely showed any of them except for the titanium gray"
For real Why cant the Pro ever get fun colors
Am I the only one loving the blue
We have Light Gray Gray Dark Gray and Blue Gray So much variety
"The texture is what I dislike One of my hobbies is watches and Im not a fan of titanium for many reasons

There you can clearly see Apple facing what watchmakers have endured for decades Titanium is annoying to work with and as a consequence it looks grainy and soft no sharp edges"
"httpspreviewredditb736qzq1yvnb1jpegwidth1125formatpjpgautowebpsc3c7bb52a251720ea4e32d349835783270f6e43c

What I see"
I wonder if this is because titanium is harder to color than aluminum or stainless steel
Gunmetal 
Is the back plate titanium or glass
Most people use a case anyway
Looks like Ryan Murphy casting a white guy with brown hair I cant tell the difference
Its apple lol But also they have surprised us before with some colorful options like when the 5c first came out
I swear they two versions of silver that look the exact same
I like the natural titanium
I wanted white  silver anyway so I was completely safe from the boredom of these  hahahha
They are incredibly boring and two of the colors look nearly identical  at least in the promo photos Perhaps it was something to do with the new material but man I wish Apple would realize pros like colors too
grey dark gewy light grey blue
At least thats the consistent approach with the pro phones
And the 15 and Plus are boring too
You know cases exist right
Get the natural and you can probably just anodize it in whatever color you like 
Wow Those suck
" Slightly better battery life except audio playback for some reason according to Apples specshttpsiimgurcomEUixkhzpng
 Always on display
 Action button
 Night mode portraits due to LiDAR sensor"
Honestly I get the Pros solely for Pro Motion That is a significant difference maker imo
Uhh all those reasons are pretty compelling to me 200 for all that Titanium 120hz and better camera are easily worth 200 to me
"Potentially more RAM but we wont know until teardowns Rumors are 6GB for the 15 and 8GB for the 15 Pro

Edit Oh also WiFi 6E"
120Hz is no joke
Thats the point of the baseline model It works for 95 of people It is If you like it get it
ProMotion makes it worth it
"Thats what the Pro phones have always been but please dont forget the ProRes and external ProRes recording actually pretty crazy to have on a phone

All those features fit pretty perfectly under a pro moniker meaning only pro users will find value in them for normal users they are just nice to haves at best and as such dont justify the price increase"
120Hz should be reason enough lol
"60 Hz on the standard model is just hilarious at this point

My Google Pixel 5 is a 3 year old upper mid range device and its 90 Hz

We all know they will get away with this yet again lol"
"Side button
Smaller bezels 
Colors"
Go over to the standard 15 thread and see what features everyone is complaining about not having
USB 30 speeds at 10Gbps lmfaooo over 10 year old technology
Honestly most people buy the Pro solely for not looking poor for buying the standard with only two lenses
Action button and spatial  better HDR video too
You just listed the reasons Im getting the pro max over the plus Biggest for me are the faster data transfer whats the point of ProRes if it takes forever and a day to transfer to a Mac the zoom lens and promotion Titanium is neat but I keep my phone in case so meh
Do they both have OLED displays
The Pro can record Spatial Video for the Vision Pro  Itll be used by may 5 of people but it is the feature that people were saying was needed for taking Spatial Videos to make any sense at all
Heavier fatter marginally thinner bezels
You pretty much got it but the faster processor faster data speed transfer and faster screen are 100 why i am excited for this phone
"Eh I am probably going to upgrade my iphone 11 to a iphone 15 pro Iphone 15 pro is only 250 euros more expensive than the Iphone 15 If I am going to spent 1000 euro on a phone I might as well spent a bit more to get the best 

A bit more battery life Always on Display 120Hz third camera and titanium seems worth the upcharge to me"
"Ive wanted 2 things

 A smaller Pro version Currently 14P Pro Max
 Longer telephoto lens

I dont care about titanium or anything else  I just wanted a smaller lighter phone with a longer lens  Im annoyed that if I want the longer lens I have to maintain the large heavy phone"
Apparently the 17 ProI bet theyll have a standard A17 for the 16 has RTupscaling support
Spatial video recording  more futureproof for AR
Youre trying too hard to be negative If youre into iphone photography theres a huge Director for Rappers named Cole Bennett thats recently been shooting his videos on iPhone for example This phone is a game changer If youre into mobile gaming which their entire countries where thats their thing Game changer Plan on having the Vision Pro and enjoying some spacial video game changer etc
8gb ram
120hz is huge Once you have it you cant go back
The processor is way afster The USBC data transfer speed is way faster The camera is way better The screenvariable refresh rate is up to the standards of android phones from 2020 Overall its two different generations of phone practically
They said they added a new lens coating that can cut down on this
iPhone 15 Pro Max with 1TB is 1979 in The Netherlandsthats 2120
999 in the UK which tranlates to 1247 USD
Prices in Germany got cheaper by 100
At least prices in Europe went down but thats probably because the euro went up a bit again thank god
Its 85 more expensive here in Switzerland not bad as thats 70 less than last years model
In Canada Pros are 50 higher
Yes other country prices are suck
"Yeah Switzerland got cheaper lol 

1079 CHF now for the base 15 Pro was 1189 CHF last year i think"
Yup base pro version where I live is 1630
Technically only in states with no state sales tax NH DE OR
Yeah its even less in the UK and most other parts of Europe lol
The 15 pro max will be lighter than your 13 Pro
Im wondering which one to buy out of these two and find it hard to justify paying twice the money for the 15 pro I might just look at 14 pro at the moment
USBC and titanium
13 pro is the perfect iphone IMO so I think you can hold out another year unless the phone is feeling sluggish Theres my 2 cents
"The 5x did look a bit rough tbh

But its a pretty useful tool in my experience I use the 3x a lot so Im not sure I would want to go back down to the 2x on the 15 pro"
Action button is an instaset to camera for me being a parent of young kids
They only talk about battery life when its an improvement Its the same as 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max
You can just get a new battery
"I guess its always difficult to give a realistic battery life expectation  My 13 Pro lasts well over a day of use but thats probably because you and I use it differently 

Itd be great if they measured battery life in something absolute like screen on time or similar

Then again degradation seems to be really inconsistent between different phones even with similar use cases"
Its the same at 14 pro which let me tell you Ive been very disappointed by My previous 11 pro was performing much better battery wise even after 2 years of use 15 might be slightly better given the new chip but dont expect anything impressive over your current one
I really like the zoom but not so much for photography It is a great tool for reading tiny text from a distance
dont forget battery life
Battery life Larger screen Its not just 200 for a lens
"Test out taking 2x3x zoom I think they make landscape photos better Makes mountains bigger etc based on how lens works Known thing 

I prefer taking 3x photos but others dont 

Lens on main camera distorts  Basically reason most dlsr cameras take portraits with 50mm lens  most natural look"
I think its well worth it You only use it in concerts because you have no other choice With the new camera the quality might be good enough to use in daily lives
Non Pro has last Gen A16 They began this Bs last year 13 and 13 pro had same a15 bionic cpu
You also get 256gb in space which if you get that in the standard size Pro would cost an additional 100  So for the same storage tier PM is only 100 more  I have a 13 Pro and really like the standard size so I think Im going to bite the bullet and go with a 256 standard size
I try to remind myself that if Im trying to take a pic of something thats still you can always move closer instead of zooming in It might not work in all situations but maybe enough not to pay for the new phone
"Yeah Im kinda shocked how its the best color I keep second guessing myself

The natural m titanium is almost as boring as the black But maybe thats bc I see it all the time on road bikes now"
Do you not use a case
Wasnt lossless audio already possible with 20 It certainly isnt a date rate issue
Using the Apple dongle and wired headphones should still spilound fine
Pretty much but thats how its been really since the iPhone X and then 12 with 5G and 14 with dynamic island
Pretty much but thats how its been with all these phones the past 5 or so years Incremental refinements rather than big changes Same can be said about operating systems
Really the iPhone 12SSS
I mean the reality is this has been the case for the last 4 or 5 years and I imagine will be the case going forward Im not sure that many people expect otherwise And I dont think this a bad thing either
Because they didnt actually raise the price they just removed the 128GB tier
The price has been raised outside of the US
The thing is these are bill credits and not instant discounts You upgraded a year ago now you wont be able to upgrade until the iPhone 18 without losing a years worth of credits They are betting on you upgrading before then plus locking you in as a customer which is worth even more Im doing the apple trade in and adding it to my boost mobile plan 25month for unlimited everything saves way more than being locked into a 90 plan for 3 years
They are giving a decent amount even on an iPhone 13 Pro Max Ill be preordering immediately on Friday
Yeah Im dumb commenting on my own comment but I just wanted to add that if you milk the system you can basically get the phone for free I just picked up a secondhand iPhone off of Facebook marketplace Going to trade that into ATT for 1000 and then Im going to sell my phone privately to get back what I had to pay to pay it off
Their site offers me 570 for my 14 pro A phone that I have owned for like 9 months and paid 1000 for How is that a sweet deal
Trade credits are only for the US market which is not majority of their market share
I agree Family and I moved to another carrier and we all got a iPhone 11 for free just by trading in what we had
It seems the 15 pro is missing the 5x lens of the 15 pro max but I wonder which one it has instead 3x Couldnt find anything being mentioned on the tech sites yet and the presentation didnt make it super clear
15 Pro Max adds the 135mm lens otherwise the 15 Pro has all the other focal lengths
"Im pretty sure its just cropping the picture from 24mm to 35mm so its just for convenience more than anything


Definitely going to miss the 52mm on my XS the compression is so nice and I dont think the 2x mode is going to have that"
Also it says that you no longer needs to switch to portrait mode yet the portrait mode is still there
What ultra now
Im annoyed a truck can carry more things than a sedan
Its pretty unfortunate but what can you say the larger body allows for larger components I presume
"what is the difference the specs make it seem like its exactly the same

Edit I see 5x lens instead of 3x"
wait how is it I mustve missed this
"Did I hear it right that they actually removed macro for the Pro

ETA Just for anyone else wondering the Specshttpswwwapplecomiphone15prospecs say that both cameras have Macro  Weird way they tried to make it sound like Macro was unique to the Pro Max in the presentation though"
"This has been the case on Samsung phones for years Its just that Apple didnt bother with periscope lenses

They take up a lot of room so its understandable"
Ive got an 11 Pro and I REALLY wanted to justify an upgrade but this looks so milquetoast I just dont see a reason
lol thats cool but there is plenty here USBC alone is huge for many of us
Yep another year with the 12 Pro  They didnt need to drop a killer feature but Im not spending 1300 on these upgrades
I mean the biggest thing for me is they weigh the same new features for the same weight not bad at all
first time watching that keynote in live cause been eager to get an upgrade from my 12pro due to poor battery life but its kinda debatable now 
What feature would even do that for you
My wife has the XS while Im running the 12 pro i think Im going to get the 15 pro max and then give her my 12 pro That seems like a better trade for now
I have an 11 Pro and was planning on upgrading this year but not really seeing any reason to still
Thats actually how brilliants Iphone marketing is Each year someone will say this but a couple years from now or so you upgrade and buy their new iPhone with newer features Apple isnt dependent on people who recently bought recent previous iPhone but people who are still rocking old gens  Either way you are buying an iPhone and are in a infinite loop inside of Apples buying scheme
I was thinking about switch from my 12 pro for the periscope camera only to find out its for the max Yeah miss me with the even larger and heavier phone
On 12 pro max was gonna get 15 pro max but know debating lol
"Im unclear if I want to upgrade my 13 Pro Max

I will be upgrading my girlfriends 12 Mini though"
Use a 120hz display for a week and youll never want to touch your 12 Pro again
Im feeling the exact same way Maybe next year
Still rocking the 6s plus here
120hz refresh rate alone is worth an upgrade in my opinion And battery life
12Pro here I might wait for the 14pros to go on discount just for that purple lol
Id keep my 12 Pro Max for another year if it werent for the abysmal battery life and the 128 gb storage
The normal iPhone colours are hideous in my opinion The titanium white and grey are the only interesting for me but I would have wanted silver so I have to pass this year
idk if it could pull more than 20W I think they would have mentioned it
Specs page is same as old phone Up to 50 charge in 35 minutes with 20W adapter or higher
350 kW  800V on a Porsche charger 
This I am not a fan of the size of the Pro Max but you cant argue with the price point Only 100 more than the iPhone 15 Pro 256GB Guess itll take some time getting used to
Im sulfides by this too really wonder what it looks like
Someone will make software to do it so Id image
How does that work Have you be taking pictures on your home wifi network
Small iterations for 10 years until some major new tech is revealed
They lowered the prices for everything in Switzerland this year Does the 999 include tax If not theyre actually cheaper here than in the US at this point 1079 including tax
It is 10x compared to the ultrawide 5x compared to normal white Standard apple marketing
Apparently the charging speed is still the same 25 W
Thats a great phone
I just upgraded to a black 14 pro yesterday It has a 30 day returnexchange policy so if the 15 pro wows me more than I thought it would from what Ive seen I can trade it So far though very happy with the 14 pro came from a sierra blue 13 pro max
I thought the entire point of forcing USBC was so that you could use your existing cables that you can use for any of your devices instead of relying on what was in the box Also my guess is that universal power is the most important consideration anyways
I think thats pretty standard for phones Most people arent gonna use it
"Its the same with a Mac Its a charging cable 

I mean because you can use any cable now you have no reason to buy an Apple one if you want to use USB3"
People are already using Apple Shortcuts that let you shoot in 48mp pro raw auto convert it to 48mp HEIF and then auto delete the raw If thats something you really want
48 MP HEIF is available on the 14 Pro in iOS 17
Third party camera apps can already shoot 48MP in HEIC and JPEG
When has it ever been different Are you expecting massive changes YOY
I dont think you really need to upgrade from a 14 Pro Max honestly lol
"The main and wide camera and main sensor for 15pm is identical to the 14pm

The only change is the telephoto lens and sensor"
15pm is 8 lighter in weight   Thats one thing Ill appreciate
In the UK the 256GB 15 Pro Max is 110 cheaper than the 256GB 14 Pro Max was which is nice
Wait for the info to appear on GSMArena
Friday
I dont imagine ray tracing is going to be very impressive Itll be beautiful and unusable or mediocre and smooth just like PS5
Yes they can open a new account on Verizon ATT or TMobile postpaid for you instore
Bland  classy generally
Pro can record to usb c hd if you dont mind carrying it around
"Im actually thinking the other way Granted this aligned with my birthday and I do want to treat myself but always on display titanium frame dynamic island smaller bezels brighter screen 48MP camera USBC 2 years worth of updates seems to be the sweet spot nowadays with iPhones 

I also hate how heavy the 13PM is lmao"
What did you upgrade to the 13 PM from
You think foldable is innovative  damn thats where we at 
Yearly upgrades 
Both will be a huge upgrade but imo the pro doesnt justify the price difference
I had an 8 plus and upgraded to 14 pro the difference is massive The moment you start using it you will notice how slow your old phone will be
Physics Greater zoom means you need more space and the smaller phone simply doesnt have the space
"Main camera should be basically identical if you are shooting pro raw 

Telephoto is now 5x instead of 3x on the Pro Max thats the major change"
Blue 
Its not a coating its 95 titanium with some aluminium The band is effectively a titanium alloy
Titanium has a pretty horrific compared to aluminum anyway thermal conductivity so Im guessing they had to use aluminum inside for heat dissipation They kinda hinted at it in the keynote
They did not say that as far as I could see The aluminum they talked about was the internal structure of the phone which was not stainless steel before either
Is that what they said I thought that was in the context of the chassis where the internals screen into
We shall see what the resistance of scratches and drops will give us in the coming weeks I doubt its as strong as presented due to the bonding process
That was the key thing that somewhat turns me off of the 15 Pro line if true I was expecting a unibody casing not an aluminum phone with a titanium jacket over itself
"Cant wait for someone to do a strength test and see these crumple They couldnt even use a solid titanium body

Apple really dropping the ball on this release"
"Itll probably help retain the price though As someone who doesnt use a case on their phone the biggest degradation in my phone is the little nicks it gets on the edges of the aluminum Normal wear and tear but very noticeable

I cant say because it hasnt had real world usage yet but in theory I think titanium should cut down on those"
"Titanium is not that exotic Its a pain to weld or machine but I got a whole bike made out of it  plus good suspension fork and drivetrain decent wheels etc  for 2000 in 2020 

Not a name brand one but still"
Apparently not
There will always be people who are able and willing to upgrade yearly so apple would be crazy to say no thanks to the money lol That plus not everyone is on the same upgrade cycle Some people go every 2 years some every 3 That way theres a new model for anyone to buy each year
Brightness is same for 14 pro which is 2k nits ram unknown probably 68GB battery same as last year do not know exact amount Wifi 6e is there
I mean yeah Literally no reason to buy a new iPhone yearly anymore
Needs to be for wireless charging only other option is plastic
To each their own I never use my mute switch as its in mute 99 of the time
You can map the action button to mute though
idk man i use that switch like once a month lol it could use more functionality
"Brother it literally has the same default action as the mute switch lmao settle down

You lost nothing You gained a lot"
I havent touched it in two years
android fanboys lost in this sub hating lmao
Presumably its for controlling things like light switches directly from the phone via ThreadThread so itll be faster
My guess is that it will skip the wifi and talk directly to your Home Hub if the connection is good
Its been great on the ultra
tradein with apple has always been a joke never do the tradein with somewhat current devices
Only the a17 has that new usb chip built in The non pro models use last years A16 which doesnt have it
"The legislation was never a court case the EU wasnt targeting any specific business entities Creating new laws that apply to everyone under a jurisdiction is a basic function of government 

Apple publicly committed to supporting Lightning on the iPhone for a decade back in 2012 the timing of the EUs actions now is really just coincidental"
Most people are already in the charge cord nightmare due to having other devices that use USB C Moving towards a single standard is nice
why cant it be both
do you use your AirPods more than once a year
are you using Smart or Globe as carrier
Dont even need an adapter just a standard AC cable
Yes
You can just use a random standard USBC to USBA cable
Wouldnt that mean the phone dimensions are shrinking
You shrink the chassis of the phone
Yes thinner bezels but same screen size as before so the overall dimensions of the Pro models are smaller
They said thinner bezels but they also changed the dimensions of the entire phone without changing the size of the screen The phone as a whole will be slightly smaller
Yes thinnest yet
"Same speed as 14 Pro 20W

httpswwwapplecomcaiphonecomparemodelListiphone15promaxiphone14promaxiphone15pro"
Im on the same boat I seem to use 3x more than 5x
I have the same phone as you and in the same boat my phone is still useable so on the fence about upgrading
here it is everyone the worst take
Why would you say that They improved it in ways that really matter like the 48mp sensor and 3x zoom
Price lowered by 100
Cant leave a comment like that and not expand upon it
Exactly lol
Wait what
There are hundreds of these available for sale on Amazon
You can pick those up dirt cheap anywhere
Dont buy Apple cables you can get the same thing for a lot cheaper elsewhere
Just get a Carlinkit and turn it wireless with Bluetooth
I wouldnt say horrible
Not really After upgrading to 14pm from the 13 pro I miss the 61 screen size and most importantly the weight
Do it on your own Save the backup on your current phone When you get your new phone transfer that backup to it
it should be with the new M3 since it will be based of off the A17
Yes it means next the 16 will get this chip but with less GPU cores
Okay thank you
"Telephoto would just be talking about the zoom lens on the phone 

The iPhone 15 Pro can do 3X optical zoom while the 15 Pro Max can do 5X optical zoom Only you can really determine if that is something you want"
No it wont fit They made the phones slightly smaller and the action button replaces the mute switch Apple usually switches things around just enough so that the previous year cases dont work
Colors four options including black titanium white titanium blue titanium and natural titanium
They are there theres hands on videos showing thinner bezels
Pro Max model gets the telephoto zoom lens this year
They usually use that as a second wind to boost sales so expect to see it around February
I think this is a good time to upgrade from an XS Im currently doing the same
15 pro max will be the obvious choice
"Current con The screen is a tad bit small for me  


Then go for the pro max"
Unless the new portraits are using two cameras at once for depth information like the 3D videos 
Why not upgrade to the regular size 15 pro then Itll be a ton lighter if thats what youre looking for
Hold out thats what Im doing
One year wait will be worth to see Iphone 16 Ultra model with major battery bump according to rumors Periscope lense will be cherry on the cake
Dont tempt me with a good time
Beat meat to it
The new titanium body is almost as stiff as Dakota Johnsons acting
Yes natural titanium has silver color
No there is a silver colour and a natural titanium colour Natural titanium has a faint bronzeyellow tint to it
Didnt they mention they added some sort of coating over the titanium surface Might not actually matter much but it could be worth watching out for
lol yeah Im probably getting the 15 Plus over a Pro Max just because of the pink
Ive always hated that the pro line doesnt get the colorful options
There is literally close to zero differences between base and pro this year you dumb
My guess is getting the colors on the titanium were a challenge so hopefully next year they can do something fun or interesting
They still do on my iPad Pro Its frustrating
"I dont understand why Google doesnt market to this exact point

Every time my iPhone fitzes out on me at an inopportune moment just because I had the gall to open the camera while navigating I feel like I should be in a commercial for an Android with 3x the RAM"
This is HUGE for me too Itll give way better multitasking And hopefully we can save multiple items to clipboard
Need more brain RAM lol
Apps closing is more dependent on the app not the RAM
My main reason for switching from an 11 Pro the app refreshing is just a pain
Ill give this guys wife a spatial
" Edit Dammit 

Dont even try to pretend it was accidental lol"
Is that like a labotomy
Ill give your wife a spatial pal
Yeah I fear this is going to be a feature only enjoyed by the 47 people who can afford a vision pro
"rParallelView is about to become more popular if one can export the photosvideos as a stereogram

The depth might be a little shallow thoughas those 2 cameras it uses arent all that far apart I can imagine a future iteration of the iPhone having a camera on each top corner of the phone to better mimic the distance of human eyes"
"Spatial Video now with even bigger file sizes  max out your storage capacity in no time 

Dont want the PITA to transfer them out via cable We have hicapacity iCloud subscription tiers for you"
LOL dude this is all software based of course it will only be playable on a Apple Vision or whatever its called Im sorry but I think its funny people even think this is a remote possibility to play these videos on a non apple VR device lol
come onits apple  of course it will be apple pro vision only
Bit of a missed opportunity to make it viewable on an iphone or ipad though Even if it had slight movements following the angle of your phone to give it depth
I wonder how many years that will take
Based on Apples naming scheme its gonna be Apple Vision and Vision Plus For bigger size Pro you get Apple Vision Pro Max The outdoor version will be Vision Ultra Will we see a Vision Mini and Vision SE
Though it does make me think of the old 360 degree camera Android used to probably still does offer I took a few 360 photos because theyd be fun to review on my phone but once I had a VR setup I revisited the same photos and they were stunning I had instant regret for not using the 360 feature more previously
I wish they would add something like tilt controls to the video player to the iPhone so you could watch it in 2D but still get some perspective by moving your phone around or something
Unless someone can figure out how to use that video and the data underneath on Oculus or something
I doubt that Most people dont even go for a 1tb iPhone What I can guarantee is that if they do sell one for a bit less it will SELL
"What do they need to combat though Theres already common laws in place on digital content and people can legally view or film content with current phones tablets laptops etc

What about Vision Pro would require different restrictions or elevated moderation compared to all other devices

Appenabled devices generally dont support pornspecific apps in their app store but they dont selectively block users from viewing their media or sites a user views"
"Its certainly very plausible that this initial iteration of spatial video capture will look wonky and not be crisp resolution also since one of the involved lenses isnt the main especially with that physical caveat youve raised that theyll need to artificially adjust

Probably mainly trying to claim firsties keep hype up on the Vision Pro with a reminder about it and make consumers feel like theyre bonus future proofing by having the ability"
They didnt mention it in the presentation but I 100 expect that the Lidar sensor will be providing additional depth data
For the pro phones theyre releasing a feature to capture spatial video 3d video The announcement said the feature will be released later this year
And the 15 and 15 plus are 50 cheaper each too Im actually Impressed that they pulled prices down again rather than making it a new normal
Wow seriously 999 Is that confirmed Thats 150 less than the 14 pro
Surprisingly the Watch Ultra 2 also got cheaper in Europe  Germany 100 EUR less 899 EUR instead of 999 EUR
Why do we think this is
I want to put on my conspiracy hat on and say that people expected this based on the rumors it would be 100 dollars more than normal Maybe apple said that to certain people to reveal who the leaker was
I think its because theyve already completed their price hikes to be honest but Ill take it
probably because they already raised the prices years ago
Please careful with your words just complain otherwise next year we will see the increase 
Where I live its more expensive than current generation unfortunately
yeah i messed up last time getting 128 so im glad they are forcing me to not make the same mistake again lol
Is it advisable to get a 512 GB this year 
Interesting prices went down in the UK 100 less for the Pros and 50 less for the base models
"Im not sure about increases but holy hell is the Pro Max expensive where I live 
So if I translate it to USD it would be 1620 for the baseline model but I dont feel that price does it justice because our currency has gotten so devalued lately and everything else has become so expensive with our rampant inflation I would say its more akin to it being 1800 for the baseline model 
The top one being something like 2600 

I have a decent but not amazing job in marketing and would probably land in whats comfortably middle class here in my Scandinavian country but the base model Pro Max is honestly almost 23 of my monthly salary after income tax 
Whew"
I mean isnt it the same price as last years 256 model
its going to be a trickle down feature like dynamic island was
And we think youre going to love it
Its a tactic to push people to the Pro models
This guy planned obsolescentses
Theyre definitely looking to differentiate the two tiers more Feels like theyre somewhat running out of reasons which is presumably why they stopped putting the new processor in the nonpro And the amount of time theyve spent on titanium was a bit funny especially when 98 of people have cases on
lmaoo
Features
If it has a good click and good haptics it could be pretty satisfying
Yeah the nickel and diming bullshit is very much on brand
What The pictures show a switch
That must be it
Yeah dont get me wrong I am pleased to see usb c smaller bezels and more battery However I can wait a year
Nope Only the yellow 14 and 14 Plus
" forest green

Wish theyd release with this every year"
Honestly because I always have a case on my phone the base color doesnt really matter A phone without a case is just way too slippery in my hand
As someone who sells apples shit it always disappoints me when I ask the customer what color they want and theyre like space gray or well obviously I dont want the pink one Thats fruity Like fine be boring or tell me your an insecure man without telling me
I would sell my Pixel 7 Pro immediately if Daytona Orange was an option
"My forest green mini is killing me its just too small I loved the color and the idea of it being easy to slip into a pocket but man my big fingers just cant type on this thing 

Giving up this color for a 15 is going to suck"
Knowing my luck Im gonna get the Natural Titanium and then theyll bring back the gold for the midcycle color
I think that is possibly to incentivize people to buy cases in the color they want
I was thinking doing the same But also taking in consideration going for the 14 Pro Max Its basically the same as the 15 pro plus pro motion and a 3x optical zoom minus 2000 nits peak brightness
Its just promotion thats getting me Got my girlfriend the 13 mini and while I love the thing I can also see it stutter all the time 
Does the 15 Pro have a 120hz sceen ProMotion If not this would be a noticeable difference
I have the 11 pro max so just about any 15 will be good for me Whats the difference between the 15 pro max and the 15 plus
Im going from base iPhone 7 to the 15 plus Its gonna be grand for me lol
Optical zoom
Except its not optical zoom
Im seriously considering if the action button and USB C are that important to me If not def going for a 14 pro
Get 15 for yourself and she can keep her 14 You deserve this
Hello its me your wife
I think you should consider keeping everyone before the 15 or everyone switch to it Having different cables between you would be annoying I am sure
Bro just get yourself the 15 lol tf
Not really amazing considering the state of the mobile phone market Increasing the price would decide their  pro sales
They definitely did Its a shame that 999 is a great starting price for a highend phone but thats the state of the world rn
999 has been the standard price for a flagship smartphone for like 56 years
"Eh at this point my 12 pro lasted 3 years and I absolutely wrecked it my own fault I got a cheap case RIP

1 a day for the same smartphone every billionaire uses aint a bad deal And the 15 pro assuming I take care of it and I will Im sure will easily last 4 years and if I get a battery replacement probably 5"
if you want to do those Aaaand thats why posts you need to work on hanging on the A more its AAaaannd not Annnnnd that just sounds weird
I thought they were doing the same with the Vision Pro when I heard 2000 rumors but then it turned out that the real thing was even more expensive lol
That trade in value only applies to carrier deals afaik Apple definitely offers less for trade in if you go through them
Thats only through certain carrier deals I have ATT Prepaid so none of those apply to me and Apple is only offering 360 for my 12 Pro as a tradein
Are they though If I trade in my 13 Pro the 15 Pro costs about 550
What
Aww you even added a lmao as if you were so right that you had to laugh
They are offering 580 for my PM decent for a 2 yo phone but not 11
rconfidentlyincorrect
When do carrier trade ins go live Dont see it on ATT
I really hope I get at least an 800 tradein deal If I dont then I either wont be getting the the 15 or Ill be switching to samsung
Not tmobile the only providerthat gives the credit over 24 months Regardless Im trading in my iPhone XR I purchased for 10 and buying a 15 outright and using it on boost mobile All these deals are shit on the big carriers Tmobile is 90month for unlimited everything I pay 25month for unlimited everything on the same towers  att towers The amount Ill save monthly will well be worth the trade in credits for the carriers
"Apple will give me less because I have some dents on the corners though wont they

front and back glass are fine just the corners have some small dents from some drops"
TMobile is only 24 but then you have to use TMobile All the carriers were 24 for the 13
Its in the base model not pro exclusive anymore
97 of people are going to cover it with a case
Its so overhyped Its literally the notch with a few line of pixels on top
Just buy any USB 3 cable
"Buy any USBC USB 3 cable and it will work probably there was rumors that theyd try to limit to MFI accessories but I really doubt theyre true Apple will charge more but I suspect itll be for their nice new braided cables at least But no shortage of cables for 20 and under

Its optional because they ship chargeonly cables with their devices that use USBC its an annoying part of the USBC spec that such things can even exist"
aint nonway
Good thing for me Im a professional video editor with dozens of usbc cables
Honestly Id be very surprised if even 1 of iPhone 15 pro users will ever use a cable for data transfer It probably be more like 01
bruh its a cable
Nope base 15 is USB20
No The regular iPhone 15 is still USB 20 as it uses the same old A16 chip that was only designed to do USB 20 speeds over lightning USB 30 is an exclusive feature to the Pro phones since it uses the A17 pro chip lol
Actually it is USB 32 USB 30 officially no longer exists
Need to save something for the next iPhone
Its just useless Even if it were a miniscule price difference it probably wouldnt be worth it for them You can transfer the entire contents of a 1TB iPhone over USB 32 gen 2 in less than 15 minutes A 256GB model in less than 4 minutes Realistically how often are 999 of customers going to do that
"They said its larger compared to the 14 not Pro

httpspreviewreddittmha01afbvnb1pngwidth2525formatpngautowebps38c757586cd81a745284a400a805e177a7ab678a"
"Only the telephoto sensor

The main camera sensor is identical to iPhone 14 Pro

Im very disappointed in this release the only improvement is the telephoto lens and thats it"
Damn youre still at 100 Im down to 93
yeah i have the 13PM and will trade it in for the 15PM for usb c alone easy
Sheep
Same price  another year of winning for me on the iUP
I have a little titanium pry bar and if the natural gray on the iPhone matches the color of the pry bar oh man its a beautiful color imo Plus the feel of titanium is different from other metals Idk how to explain it but I love it It even feels cooler in temp Im excited for this phone lol
Funny  I hate the pastels Compared to the forest green and vibrant blue from some recent phones they look so cookie cutter
Im more partial to the pro colors than the base ones but the base does at least offer some variety They could have released the Pro in any one of the offered colors and Id be just as happy with it because they all seem basically the same anyway
"The natural looks gold  sand to me Was hoping for a light gray  
edit looks much better in real photo and videos"
Look at existing Ultra watches Natural Titanium will be that colour Its like a brushed aluminum with a slight warm hue to it
I love how the natural titanium looks like a prop straight out of Dune with the taupe fineWoven case we are going full dystopian
You are correct but it still looks identical to the silver to my eyes  I even leaned in towards the screen on my laptop and was trying to discern any difference  Im sure its there but I couldnt
But did they even say that this time
Physics would accomodate a slightly thicker phone with a bigger battery
Ill take a flat phone without any camera on the back
Who is dumb enough to believe that physics prevents making a phone with a camera bump
Number one reason why I use a case so the cameras arent hitting the table
Unless you you know dont Like all the people who go naked
Ive been wondering what the point of the titanium casing is which Ive heard was supposed to eliminate the need for a case if the camera is still exposed
That would likely be ridiculously heavy I think the switch to titanium is an effort to make it lighter not heavier
yes please
That will be the Ultra For 1499
 going all the way back to the brick phone just with better interface and touch screen
Little surprised they havent come out with an apple ultra 3 day battery life phone An outdoor adventure extended battery big ol turtle shell backed phone
Just put a shittier smaller camera in I dont care about these features that dont work anyway The pictures look like shit regardless
"Im in the exact same boat I guess Im about to order a replacement battery and screen for my 11 Pro because I just cannot bring myself to spend 1000 on something so hideously designed I was hoping theyd move to periscopic lenses by now but nope

Its weird to see because Apple is supposed to be a company that pride themselves on beautiful hardware design Nobody finds a ginormous camera module beautiful"
"Yup my favourite colour on an iPhone and what I currently have for my iPhone 13 Pro Max 

This morning I was assuming I was going to get an iPhone 15 pro this cycle but now Im not so sure the features are worth it and the colours arent all that inspiring"
As a fan of pacific blue Im happy with the new titanium blue
mine is at 88
Same Ill be saving until then maybe by then the upgrade will be worthwhile to feel the difference
"Agreed
Im pretty pissed because Id love to have it but not enough to pay more to lug around a bigger phone"
Same I cant justify having a phone that large
Is the main difference the larger 5x zoom on the Pro Max Anything else
I wish I could get a high end iPhone model the size of the iPhone 5 I hate the trend of these huge phones
The pro is too big as is Pro max is out of the question
im pretty certain the 11 Pro has the same features as 11 Pro Max
The XS 11 Pro 13 Pro and 14 Pro were the same as their Max versions too lol
Im still rocking an XS because of the size  A bigger phone will be hard pressed to fit in my front pockets
Lighter more importantly Its also easier to repair vs the 14
USB C is definitely an upgrade
Only the Pro Max gets the periscope camera
The Pro Max has a 5x lens while the Pro has a 3x lens Its a physical limitation The smaller phone cant fit the larger lens
I thought the pro and pro max have the same cameras
Yeah and did you hear the other rumor of a phone over a year away from being released that the 69 model will be replacing the Apple logo with simply Nice
Im talking about the Pro and the Pro Max
Way too massive
An actually pretty scene probably just wouldnt have run at 30fps lol Theres a very good reason why the nvidia rtx gpus all need 200 watts of power
Listen to yourself Youre sitting complaining about RTX on a phone Like damn There is no winning with yall
Personally Im ok with them making the physical phone a bit smaller aka shrinking the bezels Im happy with the PM size right now
The phone itself is ever so slightly smaller You can check on the compare models page on the Apple website
im also only upgrading because im on the xs max honestly would consider just waiting another year after this lackluster announcement but im out of storage space for a while and things are a bit sluggish Im sure the camera updates will be nice at least
Same here On X for a long time but nows okay to switch even if my tradeins not to my favor
Gonna upgrade to the 15 pro max and then the 20XX at this rate
XS here  not a single reason to get the new one aside from just wanting a bit of a change lol
I have an X too Dont give in until they go all screen with no notch you coward
Kinda wish Id held onto my X a bit longer but traded it in a soon as the battery deteriorated instead of replacing it
same here will be upgrading from an xr
Same
Im still on a 7 Plus lol guess its finally time to upgrade
Same thing XR its so slow I cant bear it anymore and I think I got my moneys worth out of it
Day 1 buy for me too  For the first time EVER Ill be doing a preorder for this one  I currently have the 12 pro max and its been on its last leg  It hates the updates and the apps just close whenever
Thats a good run
Man I miss the X That was the perfect iPhone imo Somehow I feel like the camera was better on it than the camera on my 13 pro and at least the constantly shifting lenses werent an issue with the X
They didnt say how old their phone was
The subscription plan still works fine in two year intervals though
Well theres a better camera USBC and a better GPU Still not revolutionary but its not a 14S
14 pro was just so good that it makes this one look mediocre
Actually its a true 15pro phone because of a17 3nm chipissue is Apple downplayed it for some reason unknownit will improve performance battery and overall processing speedsbut Apple didnt talk about it much
I dont understand that at all My 12PM goes through waves of absolute nonexistent performance to the point that typing a character takes a moment to load How people use an 8 baffles me
Why not just change battery and keep using 11
Currently have the Galaxy S20 FE Still a solid phone but the battery doesnt hold up good anymore and wont be getting anymore software updates so gonna take this as an opportunity to jump ship
Or just me on the Upgrade Program with zero financial incentive to hold my current phone unless either price increased or I plan on holding this phone for over 2 years
Its quite explicit in the keynote
"They didnt though

So they did because they get sued every day But that has nothing to do with going USBC"
Ive always hated Live Photo lol
I wouldnt call that black
Makes more sense now Ive seen the whole phone Im sure in the keynote he explained them as natural and silver options and they looked identical
I almost always go for black or dark grey phones but I like this blue a lot
Adult contemporary Gonna listen to Steely Dan on my raw titanium iPhone
Pro colors btw
The 14 Pro purple is beautiful
The Pro has gotten nice colors every year but this year
You might be colorblind
I dont know much about the actual alloy they used but titanium can be anodized into a pretty wide range of colorshttpwwwpersonalumichedubobdentitaniumspectrumweb2jpg
Nope Way easier You can drop titanium into a solution then depending on the electrical charge you put in get basically any colour you see if you put oil on water
You just reminded me of my old HTC One M8 Man that thing was and still is a beaut
No Lidar
Can you disable the always on display Would drive me kinda nuts
Always on was from 14
battery life looks exactly the same on the 14pm
Same here If the 15 had 120hz I would upgrade to that rather than the 15 pro
"Promotion  67in screen for me

My issue here is there doesnt seem to be much to upgrade to over my current 13 pro max USBC is really the biggest selling point for me and its a mild one considering my airpods and apple tv remote both still need lightning

580 tradein value helps push me towards the upgrade too though Brand new phone at half the cost"
The first time you use a 120hz display you instantly realize you can never use a 60HZ display again
And that right there is the best reason not to downgrade 200  12 months is an extra 17ish a month Less if you keep it 2 years Thats like 2 coffeecookie visits each month
I just asked Apple support and they said the iPhone 15 models has 6GB RAM and the iPhone 15 Pro models have 12GB RAM Lol I think they mustve been smokin something when they looked at the specs for the Pros
People dont realize how big of a difference 120Hz is lol I just returned the iPad Air solely because the 60Hz was giving me an aneurism compared to the 120Hz on my iPhone 13 Pro Max
It is a big thing but its crazy how Apple is still keeping it away from the base model when there are 300 androids that support it
"external ProRes recording

I missed this got any more info on it Like can you mount an external SSD and record ProRes to that"
One of the first mobile devices that support 120hz is actually the iPad pro 2017
Which is why the normal iPhone will never have 3 camera lenses
Is this confirmed This a big reason Im still holding out on the 6s plus
2400 USD in India 
Have someone from US bring you a phone
That is a completely different phone though The pro that is 999 usd in the us is 1229 eur here including tax
Apple shows their US price before taxes as those are different in different states
It fell 100 at least so thats a nice surprise although it is due as the exchange rate has improved
US prices dont include taxes its about the same after
"But we have 20 VAT so thats why

US prices are always without taxes"
Was honestly a nice surprise
In this case size does matter
This is just wrong 15 Pro Max is 221 g and iPhone 13 Pro is 204 g
Lets be real if not for the EU apple would still have the lightning port and if you use wirless charging this is pretty irrelevant
Yup I see that Thats too bad
3 nm shouldve gotten them longer battery wonder what uses it up
Thats true Its less wasteful Ill see how the incentives are for a trade in as well
I use it for when Im trying to take pictures of something far away The thing is 3x zoom can only do so much and quality is made worse With the additional storage I can use pro res in 4k now and 5x optical zoom will also provide better quality Thats why Im probably going for the Pro Max
I do but it still looks really good
Will never understand people putting their phone in cases Buying in my opinion amazing looking and high quality phones to put them into cheap and ugly looking cases You dont even have to be careful with them Cant count how often I dropped my iPhone on the floor and nothing happened to it
Yes lossless is super easy to do even with 20 Even uncompressed 16441 LPCM is something like 15 megabitss and that bitrate is enough to have mathematically perfect audio
100 cheaper in Europe
Its 100 cheaper in the UK
In Spain it is cheaper lol
This is false it went down by 100
"Yeah but Ive been with ATT for 20 years Im not ever changing at this point Ive got our bill set up to where its 37 12 dollars per person and thats with unlimited everything No real reasons to change plus its the best coverage in my state


And I get you Im not getting my full credits but Im also not paying the full price outofpocket for my phone either I have only paid 33 of my own cash towards the cost of my phone that Ive used for the last year"
Before eBay had all their fees I used to sell my iPhone on there and get 200300 more than any offer  However with eBays fees it eats up the majority of the profit now
How much are they giving for the 13 pro max
"Its the trade in credits if you use a national carrier Sorry I realize its not everyone but its definitely a lot of folks 

If you were using one of the national carrier plans they would be giving you 1000 in credits for a phone You paid 1000 for If you kept the phone a few years it would literally be zero dollars to you"
How is the US not their majority market share
"Its 3X

httpswwwapplecomiphone15prospecs"
"yes the 3x

httpswwwapplecomiphone15prospecs"
"Pro has 3x

Pro Max has 5x"
not that I dont believe you but where can I find this info I missed this part of the keynote so Idk anything about the camera besides that the 5x is on the ultra only and well now thanks to you lol that 135mm is ultra only as well
"Is it just me or is that really an underwhelming improvement  Neat trick with the prism but its only a marginally better zoom distance while still being close enough that theres a solid argument to be made that 3x is more useful daytoday  Most things that arent close enough for a good picture at 3x are still going to be too far out for 5x but 5x is going to force you to back up more if you just want a telephoto shot yknow

Either way lame that they still dont have a periscope lens"
My mistake Max pro
Apples PR team has arrived
girl bye
iphone x had all of the top features at the normal size
Thats the reasoning every time this happened in the past and they magically find a way for it to fit in the Pro the next year This is clearly strategic to get more customers to go for the Pro Max
5x zoom
11 pro gang  Im gonna get a new battery will be like new
Ive got an 11 Pro and Im fucking stoked to finally upgrade This thing has really slowed down in the last year and my battery is still above 80
I have an 11 Pro and my screenfaceID is broken so Im definitely upgrading But also the additions of ProMotion MagSafe USBC and higherres cameras all add up to a worthwhile upgrade imo even if my phone wasnt broken
Id trade in the 11 pro sooner than later just for the trade in credits lol I was in the same boat last year but saw an ATT deal and they gave me like 9001000 in trade in credits and I got the 14 pro for 224month lol Tempted to just take that deal every year or every other
Honestly same but my iPhone 11 is always hot and I charge it atleast two to three times a day despite having had changed its battery a few months ago
"Ive got an 11 Pro and I REALLY wanted to justify an upgrade but this looks so milquetoast I just dont see a reason

Thats actually how brilliants Iphone marketing is Each year someone will say this but a couple years from now or so you upgrade and buy their new iPhone with newer features Apple isnt dependent on people who recently bought recent previous iPhone but people who are still rocking old gens Either way you are buying an iPhone and are in a infinite loop inside of Apples buying scheme"
"12 introduced the lidar 13 added 120hz and dropped the notch to an island 14 made it dynamic

But really its about 11 being the last round edged model 12 onwards they switched to current hard edges

Also 120hz"
XS here I really feel like a 15 Pro Max will be a upgrade that is well worth it
you would upgrade just for usbc
Well considering you get a hefty trade in value it is more like 600 on those upgrades and even more if you are willing to sell it privately
Ill happily wait for the next design refresh  Still love my 12
Exactly When I first had the iPhone 13 Pro in my hands a friend has one I was negatively surprised by how heavy it was This really is a positive point that both weigh exactly the same
Well 12 Pro was the first gen with 5G Thats always expected to have a bad battery live I still went for it but Im upgrading because of that reason alone if tests support that the battery life is better Dynamic Island more zoom same weight higher display brightness USBC 
New design
Hmm yeah in the same place Have noticed some slowdowns that Im not loving lately but I could probably wait 1 more year Not sure
MagSafe is probably biggest thing
 Thats actually how brilliants Iphone marketing is Each year someone will say this but a couple years from now or so you upgrade and buy their new iPhone with newer features Apple isnt dependent on people who recently bought recent previous iPhone but people who are still rocking old gens Either way you are buying an iPhone and are in a infinite loop inside of Apples buying scheme
Same Was also hoping for a bigger change 
Same here my back glass is shattered though That justify an upgrade right
Thank you I think the pastels must be very polarizing
"Look up Samsung T5 or T7 They are creditcard size SSD drives You can easily stick one on the rear of your phone use a small USBC cable and record directly to your 2TB SSD or even bigger 

Then  go to your MacPC connect the SSD with USBC and transfer your files for editing

For videomakers this is huge Its the reason I bought the 12 pro max at the time but shots and practical stuff like storagetransferring made it a hassle This seems to fix a LOT "
Here in CA we have 79 percent sales tax so about the same
Your existing usb c setup will work with iphone 15 the phone itself is limiting speeds to USB 2 nothing you can do to boost it even with Apples own chargers
Yes and thats still true here The included cable will probably hopefully work with other USBC devices USBC is nothing but a connector shape You can have anywhere from USB 20 speeds to USB 4 It can also be used as a display connection or for Thunderbolt
Pretty sure ProRaw is the only way to turn off the SmartHDR garbage So if you shoot 48mp HEIF itll be on
Why would they do that when you can just use Halide
Yeah I get the shortcut thing and have done it but honestly a pain at times Glad it is a built in option
Do you have a link for a shortcut like that The only one I found crashed before deleting so I had a lot of duplicates
"Just saw that and awesome Now I am seriously doubtful will upgrade

Been on beta for a while but no one pointed it out if it was there"
Yes I am aware and thanks for the response
which ones
Everyone was hoping for the periscope zoom lens to be 10x
No wasnt really expecting a huge difference But they have more to come
True and the macro mode thing Not much different
"Lets not get too crazy here as in real world it makes little difference Here is a comparison I did 

781 ounces 221g for 15PM vs 847 ounces 240g for 14PM so only 19g difference To put that into perspective the clear apple 14pm case is 34g"
Thank you
i understand the order is on friday but im asking about the pre save so that you can fill out all the information for checkout before friday its been like this for several years now i just havent seen it today
Sweet Seemed confusing through the store app Maybe Ill just do it all in store
Had a 14PM before I switched to android Fine phone but Id prefer USBC seeing as allll of my other devices use it
for real thats me sold on the 256gb then
Yeah this is a huge feature for those who record lots of video
"Treat yourself king

I have the 14 PM but I kind of regret it as its a bit too large for me so Im debating to trade it in for a 15 Pro Id get the normal 15 if it only had Pro Motion"
Honestly even the smaller 14 pro is pretty heavy Im really looking forward to the lighter weight as that was the only issue I had with recent pro phones
Fair points on the above 2 years appears to be the sweet spot in terms of resale value so go for it I did find the 13 Pro Max heavy and remember holding it for the first time thinking it was chucky boy lol
I also have 13PM I didnt choose I drown front cameras on my 11P after 25 year and I had it for 470 as APR employee but I couldnt excuse minor upgrade for smaller lighter 15P But I could have it basically for 300 after resell
iPhone X
"Honestly apples stagnation in the space is so prolonged that a foldable here would be innovative They know that if we want the bigger experience then we need an iPad 

Personally Id like something like Samsung Dex for iPhone Be able to turn it into a desktoplaptop replacement Like a one device to rule them all kind of thing I have a Samsung that does this my work phone and its great to be able to plug into a monitor and have a desktop experience 

I think it would be incredible if Apple could triple down on the sensor size for imagery  bring it as close to full frame Lots of challenges there but would love to not have to carry around a DSLR if I could get amazing imagery thats light years ahead of the competition 

But as far as Im concerned its been iterative for what feels like 8 years now Id love to see some innovation"
How do you take care of your screen though I want to use my 14PM without a case but the last time I did it I got a scratch on my screen when I put it down front side on my desk and moved it
Thanks alot Im glad the brightness is staying the same 2k nits is already bright enough and itll help with heat and battery life Glad to hear about wifi 6e Doubt therell be a ram increase since were getting a storage increase for essentially no extra cost compared to last year And the battery should be a little better thanks to the 3 nm chip and A17 Along with the titanium usb c extra storage thinner bezels action button and 35 watt charging speeds this is actually a great set of upgrades Very impressed
That is a good thing
Oh yea I forgot about that
In fact this is the default mapping
Why do that when you can complain instead
Its value is in seeing that the phone is on mute while its lying on the table and feeling it in ones packet This change will at minimum make the former useless and the latter take longer as one will need to cycle to check if its on mute in the pocket Its a big step down for those of us who use that switch I acknowledge some people who use Apple Watches dont use the switch and could find use with the button for other tasks
I only use it when it accidentally gets toggled to unmute
That makes no sense very few android phones have a mute switch
"You can also have a wider coverage with meshing so you dont need to extend your WiFi to cover your whole property as the nodes route you Edge cases like that

Its pretty handy when you have lots of rebar in your walls"
Youre telling me that the A16 isnt capable of data transfers faster than usb2 protocol That would mean that the smartphone as a whole has a very very limited bus size and would be bottlenecked by that
I have an AirPods charger that came with the AirPods I also have a Belkin 3in1 stand I charge them often as Im sure people would it would be very rare that Id be caught out needing to charge them and even rarer that Id just happen to have a USBC to Lightning cord on me when I never get caught with a dead iPhone battery
it did by about 1mm in each dimension
I wish they would have kept the dimensions the same and made the screen a bit bigger
ahhh that makes sense thank you
Does this mean that screen protectors made for the 14 series will be compatible with 15 series
Mine is in great shape Still in same case and screen cover Ill probably wait until I see what Tmobile offers
Yes within iPhone lineup but compared to android phones the pro seems bit overrated
Well kinda Its 1200 so same as last year but you get increased storage
Yes there are tons of it available in Amazon but these third party cables are really unreliable when it comes to Carplay sometimes they disconnect and you have to unplug and plug it in again multiple times to make it work but when youre using Apples it just works flawlessly for some reason
I tried to do that but it didnt play nice with hotspot when I was trying to share data
"There are two issues with this

1 Wireless CarPlay lags significantly compared to wired
2 Wireless CarPlay absolutely destroys my battery"
Personal taste I guess but the whole brushed metal thing looks so grungy and horrible to me Nothing sleek about it which a high end device should be
These will be a lot lighter though
So backup saves all my photos and data on my current phone I have used 127128 gb
So the Pro model doesnt get the 5x telephoto Typical Apple I wanted a lighter weight phone but I dont want to give up features if Im already spending 1K on the phone
They have to that was a basic premise for the original portrait mode But again last years iPhones have as many cameras as this years
Dad get off reddit im trying to use the phone
Nice job bud you almost had it there
"It looks like it has a tinge of brown in the screenshots Guess you would call this a warm silver which I dig

The colors suck but I think natural will pair well with the evergreen case"
Or does the natural silver have titanium color
Except the side button do you think it has a big differences between the cameras
No etiquette
I hope thats the case but theyve been able to put colors onto stainless steel for a while and they still chose not to put a single fun color onto any of the stainless feel iPhones From what I understand PVD on titanium is also a pretty common thing so Im not sure that there are many limitations on the colors that can be achieved with that process
Even with 8GBs of RAM Nooo 
"Exactly Its as if I should look off into a camera and be like are you guys seeing this 

Wasted marketing opportunity tbh"
Yo Such a clipboard would be awesome
Wait iphone has clipboard just like the one in windows
No need for this sort of pie in the sky thinking as multi item clipboards This sort of technology surely cant be adapted to a phone s
Hahaha Im overdue for an upgrade
"Okay do you remember the last time any app randomly closed on your MacBook Mind you those are much larger apps and we often have so many open at once and not once does any of them randomly get kicked out of memory 

Same thing with Windows Heck my 4GB RAM windows could hold so much too its just that it would slow down significantly but at least I wasnt losing progress on that tweet I was typing or that message I was responding to

Why then do you think its acceptable to have this happen on your smartphone A device most people use more than their laptops"
Yet many people dont even notice it That was why I left the 11 Pro Max as well but it still isnt good enough on the currently available iPhones
"You reminded me of my favorite cursed comment ever I also choose this guys dead wifehttpswwwredditcomrAskRedditcomments5c79n0commentd9uf56l

To get the best spatial Ill help to fill the empty space
Can she handle 3D
Amazing
I came here to say that  On her
Its more about setting up for the future In 10 years when the vision pro evolves to be a pair of glasses youll be able to watch these vids then Its the same idea as the LiDAR sensor
Its not even just about being able to afford a Vision Pro its about being able to do so and thinking its worth the money If the 2nd gencheaper version is actually 1500 I think itll be a much easier sell
Tbh as far as just affording it is concerned the majority of people can especially with financing Wont make sense for everyone obviously but anyone who wants to seriously consider buying one likely can do so
There will be dozens of us dozens
Do you think the software on the headset will magically generate the data It has to be encoded somewhere in the file lmao
Hopefully thats in the pipeline Im sure itll look at least slightly different Or maybe its a hint towards 2024 device screen capabilities
I would say at least 5
because Apple would not appreciate the association that should be pretty much obvious
"the problem wouldnt be resolution it would be artifacts from the AI trying to figure out what should go where

Lets say you use the left hand lens video for the left eye on the apple vision pro now you need to feed video into the right eye you cant just use the right lens from the iPhone since its not far enough apart so the scale of everything will look way off you have to use AI to try to shift that image more to the right

but that involves guesswork the lens literally isnt in the correct location in 3d space so youll have to assume what some things would look like from a different angle"
Additional depth data wont help the fact that you dont have different optical perspectives that are more than a few centimeters apart
oh meh feature imo dont think 3d is super big
Theyve done this before and seems like they will continue to fluctuate depending on the strength of the local currency
Its what it says on Apples website
I mean leakers are never 100 percent correct anyway
It should have been illegal to sell me a 64GB iPhone I regret it every single day
"I mean go into the Settings app and check out how much storage you are currently using Personally Im not even hitting 128GB of actually used storage so I probably wont step up

But keep in mind that photos taken on the new phone will be significantly larger due to the increased resolution"
Seems like UK VAT is 20 on iPhone so its effectively 1040 USD  VAT or 4 more expensive than in the US when not counting VAT
Obviously but as they just said they are someone who normally wouldve bought that 128GB version so they now have to spend 100 more than they would have if they want the Pro Max
but what if you dont need the storage
Yes but they dont sell the 128gb model So all those users have to pay 100 extra for something they dont benefit from
"To be fair Apple adopted the Dynamic Island on the nonPro iPhones quite quickly 

I was fully expecting to see the notch on the iPhone 15 I guess a surprise"
"Wish they would trickle down the 120hz display

Edit  yes I am well aware promotion wont come to the base models anytime soon  Doesnt make it any less bs though"
They want more apps to make use of it so trickling it down to nonPro a year later is the way to go Although honestly it shouldve been done last year but it is what it is
It makes sense Pro models only live for one year normal models live for 23 years If a new feature doesnt get the uptake they expect why lock it into a normal model for years
Its more fun to call it the lonely island
"Cant innovate anymore my a

To be clear thats not grawlixhttpswwwmerriamwebstercomdictionarygrawlix I can say ass if I want to"
like piss on the proletariat
Well see still exclusive to Apple Watch ultra
The alpine green and sierra blue are the best iphone colors ever
Id do anything for a pink pro or pro max 
Plus we finally get another cool blue phone
"Im on a 12 pro max and thinking of a 14 pro max 

They usually heavily discount the previous pro max to move left over stock 

Im in Canada

I dont know beeping about the differences between the 14 pro max and the 15 plusor maybe the 15 pro max I dont think I could go back to the smaller screen"
Im slightly glad my 12 Pro doesnt have it so I wont miss what I dont have
every Pro since the 13 has ProMotion
Seconded wtf lol
Nah to be honest Im in a stage of my life that I dont really care about smartphones anymore I only use it for Reddit taking pictures sending messages and occasionally listening to Spotify I just want a new one so I can guarantee that my apps wont slow down anymore lol
Spoken like someone who doesnt love their wife If he gets her 14 then they both get new and exciting phones Why wouldnt you want her to have that when youre still getting a huge upgrade yourself
Nah giving your partner the new one is such an easy w come on
Nah we have a few lightning cables to spare no problems for us right now
Thats been the price since 2017 Its amazing it hasnt moved
I mean its not a big deal to me When the phones were making meaningful updates year after year Id go 12 years between upgrades Now that theyre expensive and incremental I spend about the same amount per year on phones because I go at least 4 years between updates To be honest Im really split on whether theres enough new stuff between my 11 Pro and the 15 Pro to justify an upgrade As far as I can tell its mostly the same phone in terms of my daytoday use cases
Considering how much inflation is running rampant the past few years that price actually seems cheap now compared to the iPhone X launch in 2017 6 years ago
The rumors were over 2000 with 3000 being the most common value and rumors almost never overestimate prices by a substantial amount
Yeah Im hoping ATT offers some good deals coming up
You are correct I already checked Apple offers UPTO 650 on their website and said up to 1000 through carrier deals and tell you to go check those websites
100 Just checked on Apples site just to see and they offered 400 or so for my 13 Pro
I figured they havent updated it but the language he used made it seem like it was through Apple
httpswwwapplecomshopbuyiphonecarrieroffers
Its not worth it for me on my 13 Pro Max but I think its worth the trade in for my girlfriends 12 mini 200 up front vs 200 up front and 600 over 36 months so Ill still come out ahead regardless
Take it to an Apple Store Ive noticed the employees barely care at all vs the third party trade in company
That doesnt make it any less useless
Maybe dynamic island wont be a forgotten feature anymore Sounds like support for it is halfassed Is it even useful for anyone
cases used to leave a cutout for the toggle but now that its a button it will likely be covered like the rest
Its the equivalent of the touch bar and will soon be trashed
Yeah but then I cant brag about my super luxury 50 Apple cable
Anker is your friend
I shouldnt need to shell out extra to get full USB speed on my 1k phone
Apple will block those using software
"The chargeonly cables are really just USB 20 When it comes to USB the letter only signifies the shape of the connector Just as USB A supported USB 102030 and so on USB C supports all of these technologies as well except maybe 10 idk Im not an expert

It may be confusing but its necessary to keep costs down Otherwise all manufacturers would need to make 50 Thunderbolt 4 cables This is why you can find a cheap USB C charging cable for under 10"
I for one am very glad that chargeonly cables exist
What makes you doubt theyd limit data speeds on nonMFI If I could place a real world bet on them throttling 3rd party cables I would Just seems so onbrand for Apple lately
thats the Thunderbolt 4 cable wayyy faster than USB 3
Thunderbolt 4 is not the same as USB C  USB 30
Its overpriced but Thunderbolt and USB 30 are not the same
Why be right when you can be angry
Thats thunderbolt 4 not usb 3
You are so wrong lol This comment is ragebait
"Look at you angrily spreading misinformation for bullshit internet clout

Your parents must be so proud of you"
"Thats a Thunderbolt 4 cable

Heres their 2m USBC charging cablehttpswwwapplecomshopproductMU2G3AMA240wusbcchargecable2m"
Thats probably the longer TB4 cable though
WTFFFF
"If youve ever used an eGPU or any other peripheral that essentially is connecting via PCIE over USBC youll understand the absolute pain it is to find longer high quality cables 

Apples def charging a premium here dont get me wrong but I will say out of all of my Thunderbolt 3 cables that Ive owned the only ones that still work are the Apple ones The Anker OWC and Belkin T3 cables I had all died and I suspect all of them died due to heat"
Thats a usbc to lightning cable
 transfers data at USB 2 rates
Your Pixel shipped with a 20 cable
Seriously There are so many people walking around the grocery store with pro models While you cant judge a book by its cover im fairly certain the gentleman in the waste management uniform isnt stressing ProRes 4K30 vs 4K60 and transferring his RAW image data to his Mac Studio
Im a pro user  Use my phone daily to shoot video for news coverage  I havent transferred anything by cable since when it was the only option whenever that was
Literally just airdrop
Even on this Android 7 tablet I dont plan to use a data transfer cable since I am already connected to wifi at 400 mbit
I was expecting them showcasing some special use case for the faster data transfers but nothing When the rumors said it was going to be usb 4 I was sure stage manager was coming to iPhone to use your phone like a mini desktop akin to the iPad but Im so disappointed Maybe next year
I dont know it sounds like his cable is very thick and stiff
" Look at the cable included by Samsung Its not any different from a regular cable

And those are USB 20 but Samsung just forgets to say that anywhere

httpswwwredditcomrsamsungcomments15sby2owhatspeeddotheincludedusbccablesfors23

Look at the cable by One Plus Thats a nice cable

Nice USB 20 cable yeah

httpswwwonepluscomglobal10prospecs

 6 The USB 31 GEN1 function requires a data cable that supports USB 31 GEN1 nonstandard configuration sold separately The standard data cable supports USB 20



 Baker also has a super flexible usbc cable

No idea what youre about but if its super flexible then its pretty much guaranteed to be USB 20 as well"
Exactly
"As a sidenote USB 20 was created in 2000

30 in 2008

40 in 2019"
inevitable as the A16 doesnt support USB 30
Shout this disgrace louder Shame of a company
Honestly I didnt know USB was a hardware thing at all
"Wrong

Specs from Apple for iphone 15 even worse

Charging and Expansion
USBC connector with support for
Charging
DisplayPort
USB 2 up to 480Mbs

Yeah I wasnt talking pro models I see original topic was pro now"
i always tell them its larger and then when the time come its too late to back out
And even there its half an improvement as you loose the 77mm lens you have no option between a numeric 48mm and the telephoto 120mm and thats where I shoot the most personally
And USB C
Yeah Im surprised actually I use it at least 8 hours a day mostly for music and some youtube browsing through instagram and TikTok some Reddit for sports news location always on background refresh off screen time off Still 100
Im at 99 day 1 iPhone 14 Pro Max I average about 6 hours of screen time a day
My launch day 14pro is at 88 has to be one of the worst batteries I have had on an iPhone
1 TB for me
You got that right We all are
Unironically true considering inflation and the more expensive materials
I love the pastels Opinions seems really split
Same here Hate the pastels
Is there photos of the phone in the real world from after the keynote aired Not just the Apple marketing images of them i mean
I think thats just the yellow lighting reflections
"Take a look at the store page  theyre quite clearly different httpswwwapplecomshopbuyiphoneiphone15pro

You get black white warm gray natural titanium and blue"
No
The 15 Pro is thinner than the 12 Pro according to the specs That makes me a bit sceptical
Idk Usually thats what they say They never show numbers Feels like normal 15 got more upgrades compared to pros
People have been saying this for years literally since the iPhone 6 the iPhone would be 50 thicker and far heavier they followed this logic
"Meanwhile people are cheering about the lighter titanium phones 

A flush back of the phone with current camera sizes would be an absolute brick of a phone"
"You think Apple hasnt tested the responses to iPhone Fat Max iteration

3 people wanting a brick probably arent gonna win the majority"
That would be a huge jump in weight for the 2 of people that dont charge their phone often
The 15 is thicker than the 14
iPhones have been getting thicker ever year since the iPhone 6 They are thicker and the battery lifes are getting better They literally are listening and making adjustments
Id much rather have a phone lighter than the 11 pro
the day dumbasses like you drop this stupid take will be the day to celebrate
Its not just thickness Theyve been increasing the thickness every year Its the weight
Ill second this Would like to see slightly thicker phones with bigger battery and doing more with the cameras Thicker wont make them harder to hold Possibly easier for a lot of people
A slightly thicker phone with a smaller camera and bigger battery would be my preference
"These new phones are already giants in the pocket 

Add weight and it just makes them even worse"
Which puts you in the vanishingly small minority
Its a tradeoff dude Of course you can get a smaller bump but this will also mean more limited features I design medical microscopes for a living and theres no way around optics if you want a certain feature set or performance target But by all means let us know when you can get photons to behave differently as that would be a scientific breakthrough
Who is dumb enough to believe something with literally 0 experience in that field
Those people are insane
No one should an iPhone without a case
why would it eliminate the need for a case  It still is 90 glass
Ridiculously heavy The thing weighs barely anything
Theres no Ultra this year
"Do you have any specific complaints about the camera

Ive found that since about the XS era its much more aggressive about tone mapping and color correction  Skies are always the same shade of blue plants are always the same shade of green regardless of the light etc

In aggregate it looks better if youre just shooting snapshots and you want them to have that socialmediaready pop but as a photographer I find it kind of annoying and am always having to color correct things back to reality  I could just shoot in raw but ugh that workflow"
Ditto Im actually going to go try the Z Fold5 Because I just cant get on board with this weak lineup and my current iphone is dying this week its not receiving calls Hard ot even think about leaving  yet Im still going to test it in store
Im at 89 after only a year that cant be right
As someone with a 14 pro max I love it but cant tell if its just because Im used to it by now Sometimes I pick up my gfs non max model and think its tiny but way more comfortable to hold
That appears to be it besides the size and battery
The 11 Pro was my favorite iPhone  Last one before they made them square  If it had MagSafe I wouldve kept using it for years
Thats what another year of wellfunded engineering resources buys you yes
"But then the pro max will have a 15x zoom and the regular pro only 6x

s"
I get what youre trying to say but technology does shrink over time
Its not an upgrade Just a different plug Lol
They said the same thing when the 12 pro came out and for the 13 and 14 pro the small phone had the same cameras as the big one
Nope the Max has a 5x zoom option
I heard they are rebranding to the numbers four and twenty
Wasnt it always like that Shouldnt but hey at least they kept the pricing reasonable
"Someone buying regular iPhone could say the same thing why do they put 3 cameras on the pros and not the regular 

At the end of the day Apple is trying to make the different models have specific features"
for you maybe
Im complaining about the demo scene not about ray tracing
Im on the xs not max the battery is almost dead and storage may as well be non existent I was holding for usbc and upgrading now actually may be worthwhile And the modem on the xs fucking sucks
" Im sure the camera updates will be nice at least

Be prepared to be disappointed"
I like to wait long enough that when a new phone is in my hands its like an electric lightbulb to a caveman
"You say that like its a bad thing more people should be doing this

Im on the XR and previously on a 6 so its a five year cycle for me too"
"Yeah my XS is fine The battery is a little shit I guess I could get another year out of it if I want 

Not sure Will watch a few reviews get one in hand see how it goes"
Same the WiFi seems to be going on my XR and the battery is shot at this point
Its barely any different though Youll own the phone after two years but the trade in value will be around half of a new phone when you upgrade which is already essentially what youre getting off by upgrading every year under the plan
Heard the battery was worse than the 13 Pro though Part of the reason I just kept my 13PM Is there truth to that
So like every iPhone upgrade 
"My 12PM slows to a crawl if its outside on a blistering sunny day but otherwise performance is fine Is your battery shot

The 8 holds up well for a 6 year old device Slows down quite a bit during screen sharing on FaceTime but otherwise its fine"
My mum is still holding onto her iPhone 7 and its starting to lag on some of the games she likes to play so shes been also asking me to switch to a new phone so she can get my iPhone 11 Not changing just for the sake of changing btw We try to maximise our devices as much as possible till it gets too annoying Only reason why I got my iPhone 11 was because her iPhone 6 couldnt run Pokmon go at all haha
Its quite explicit in the keynote You dont say Somehow I missed that thats awesome I never liked cloud services I always prefer having my media stored locally and for those who dont have the luxury of having a 1TB iPhone having a small ssd with me seems like something I will look into
Yeah its definitely more graphitegrey though they do call it Black Titanium on the site Im sure that similar to last year it probably looks quite dark in certain lightingangles Ill be going with dark blue
For real the special pro color was a tradition at this point
Annodized titanium is shite Thats why they used PVD which is really hard to get a saturated colour with
"but how well does it hold I know its not the same thing but iphone 5 and scuffgate was a thing

I would mention fingerprints too but they clearly dont care about that considering the m2 air midnight"
How durable is that color coat
I loved that phone
According to Apples model comparisonhttpswwwapplecomiphonecompare the iPhone 15 does not have a LiDAR scanner
You couldnt in the iOS 16 beta but yeah you can now
Yes you can and you can turn it on but with no wallpaper etc too
I dont own a phone with one so I cant say but I would have to assume you can
It was from the 14 Pro Were not comparing the 15 Pro to the 14 Pro Were comparing comparing the 15 Pro to the 15 The 15 Pro has an alwayson display The 15 does not
Youre the second person that did this This thread is not comparing the 15 Pro to the 14 Pro It is comparing the 15 Pro to the 15 Whats your point
And they Apple know that
Thats the only thing making me go to a 15 pro instead of a 15 coming from a 13 pro user 
In the US the carriers tend to give 1000 trade in value
Thats why I just do apples IUP If Im paying monthly might as well have a guaranteed no cost upgrade each year Been on it since the 6s and get the new one launch day every year
Is the 15 pro the same screen size as the 12
How do you know what your trade in value is I was wanting to check mine to trade in with ATT
Ditto But my current is doing weird stuff  prob dropped too many times Im seriously considering the Plus model Im wondering if Id notice the lack of 120hz Thats about Theo boy thing Im worried about Ive also decided to test a Z Fold5
Its somewhat subjective I adapt easily I obviously see a difference sidebyside and when switching over but I get used to either very quickly I dont play games on the phone though
Not really I have a 120hz and 60hz phone that I use daily Its not that big of a deal
"I used to think that  S21Ultra to a 14 Pro but now Im primarily using my 13 Mini  Takes a little getting used to the 60hz again but after a day or so it doesnt bother me one bit  


I should add I dont do a lot of quick scrolling through social media so that helps"
I have it I cant tell the difference but I dont play games
Meh I have a 240hz main monitor with a 60hz monitor next to it and I have an iPhone 12 I notice the difference between the 60hz and 240hz mostly when gaming but not really when browsing and I definitely dont find the 60hz on the iPhone 12 to be laggy or slow Would it be better Probably but its not a necessity unlike on a gaming monitor
Ive used 120144Hz screens for near a decade and its incredibly easy to swap to and from 60 Hz displays
You dont miss what you dont have though People have been perfectly fine with 60Hz Its only when you get accustomed to the higher refresh rate that the lower one is not as nice
"Yeah it just depends on how much you use your phone Im always on it so for me I want the best experience and if I look at it at cost per usage its very low If I was recommending a phone to my mom Id recommend the regular 15 or even an older model just because she probably wouldnt care about the screen the camera is going to take pictures of her dogs just fine and shes going to put it in a chunky case day 1 anyway 

I have the 14 Pro Max and while I see the perks of the 15 pro and would prefer it in a vacuum unless I can sell my phone for like 900 I dont see the value in upgrading I also want to feel the 15 pro max in my hand because I felt that my phone is too sharp on the back edges to use without a case It actually hurts my fingers the way I hold it because the corner is so sharp So if I cant hold the 15 pro max for very long and I need a case anyway then I really dont care about it being titanium"
lol wut theres no way I mean that would be incredible but not a chance lol
The YouTuber Ludwig was an apple support person for a while so were not dealing with the top brass at apple when you reach out to support
What do you guys do when you have to use a work device where you dont get to choose  I have a 13PM and i honestly never notice a difference in refresh rate
Thats a bit ridiculous I dont think many people are that sensitive to refresh rates Its definitely not something to celebrate haha
"lol people being so dramatic Yes 120Hz is nice but 60Hz is still very very usable

You guys are worse than gamers that swear by 300Hz and claim anything less makes them puke Yet they are happy playing the newest Zelda game that barely hits 30Hz"
Bruh youre that sensitive 99 of devices were 60hz not too long ago
Meanwhile console gamers ThE HuMaN eYe CANt sEe MoRE tHAN 30fps
Im curious if Ill notice it On computer monitors I didnt really notice much of a jump from 60  120 but for whatever reason 120  144 was massive to me
Huh Interesting I returned the gen 10 iPad this summer  something was bothering me partly that every app was diff between phone and iPad Couldnt quite decide what it was but felt better back on phone full time
For sure But its working as theres no way Id go back from a Pro to a nonPro as Id lose the 120Hz
Its in the video recording section in the compare tool on their sitehttpswwwapplecomcaiphonecomparemodelListiphone15promaxiphone14pro during the live stream I believe they said external drive not external recorder it was right after they had announced USB C and USB 3 support so its likely because the port is finally fast enough to actually record to an external drive now
Thanks
It was in the keynote so pretty well confirmed Id say
Lol
I dont know why youre being downvoted
So much for made in India
Wtf
Do you have the math to prove that For what Im searching highest state tax I see is around 9 In portugal its 23 How is it only 50 difference
And assuming you get a sim card slot too
Calling 17g the difference between normal and a brick is wrong especially when moving to a max device
I mean your battery may be kind of pooched considering youre using the longest lasting phone on the market in that form factor essentially
A17 pro
More ram more cores more gpu Smaller process  same battery life
I agree with you But I need a case personally because of the protruding camera I think it is such a shame
You dont understand why people would want to protect their 1000 phones from damage
Ergonomics for me Its really slippery without a case
I rock my phone caseless but I understand why people put cases on theyre phones The phones are durable but a single nick in the bodywork can dramatically reduce the resale value
"I agree with you but the thing that annoys me about the current phone design is that the camera is protruding Without a case I cannot have the phone lying flat on a desk 

Does this seriously not bother you"
I guess its more like now you dont need a specialty lightning adapter Since theres usbc adapters out there
560 I think Which is fine Ill take that instant credit
"485 in Europe   
cries in Euro"
"Apple sells more phones outside the USA combined than they sell in USA alone

httpswwwstatistacomstatistics382175quarterlyrevenueofapplebygeograhicalregion"
Wait so the pro max is only half the optical zoom of a 3yo Samsung S21 ultra
5x Is that it
Dont know I just watched they keynote
What Even the standard iPhone has the ultra wide
"Nah Just common sense You get a third camera you get less space for battery then people will complain the battery life isnt as good as they want it to be and be disappointed 

Pick and choose your battles"
Girl bye 
"Hey Siri please define common sense

Actually its physics but I guess not many of you are thinking about physics"
Different features lol
Cool
Yup Next year theyll give some pitch about how they were somehow able to fix the 5X into the Pro
Do you know how big computers used to be Was this also some conspiracy Or maybe technology advances
Latest rumours are that 16 pro will be increasing to 63 inches to accommodate the new telephoto camera
Its not magic the pro is rumoured to be moving to a 63 screen
wait what does the base pro have Just 3
11 regular gang here running iOS 17 beta and Im holding on for another year This phone runs just fine and daylight pictures are good enough for me
11pro max 256gb here In the best color green Gonna get a new battery and wait longer too 
My 11 pro battery is also ass even after an insurance trade in about 2 years ago Still cant bring myself to upgrade after buying 11 pro day 1 Kinda sad really
"Go for it I got a new battery and it breathed new life into my 11 Pro

No plans on upgrading at least till Apple deprecates the model as vintage"
I know the answer to this question is subjective but what do yall think is the right time to get a new battery Mine is currently at 86 and it feels like I have to charge it at least once mid day
If this chip is not 3nm you should not upgrade imo Battery life of 14 pro is horrible
Im not sure if its the same issue facing me but make sure youve updating iOS and try a restart For some reason my 11 Pro gets really hot whenever a new update is ready I think it has something to do with my very old install Ive been upgrading since the first model and I suspect Im importing a lot of legacy settings and data which is causing issues I just cant bring myself to do a fresh install
Okay but I used to buy a new iPhone every year Theyre making a lot less money on me per year than they used to
yep
Yeah this is whats making me go for it too
What design would compel you to purchase though its just a screen
iPhone designs have plateaued There likely wont be a major re design for a long time
Youre going to be waiting a solid 5 years for a new phone then lmao
Same here 11 PM Battery is on 82 so might just upgrade to 15 PM
Yeah same here 77 sales tax
105 percent here in Southern California
"This threads on the Pro phone which does have an SOC that supports higher USB standards the point I was making is that the data transfer speed over cable probably doesnt actually matter in the aggregate versus charging ability especially on the packin cable versus whatever other universal cables you possess

I wonder what will happen if manufacturers just stop including cables in the name of ewaste reduction I think thats allowable Not sure  lord knows how many pack in chargers and cables are just chilling in their boxes never to be used"
Chargers dont have anything to do with data speeds
"Im using a 13 pro from 2 years and i still have to find a single photo that looks better with the smarthdr They are all worse

I dont understand why they still keep that on"
Halide is paid but this is my way too Works really well esp since you can choose to save 48MP as a 1525MB JPEG if filesize is an issue
"
httpspetapixelcom20230902howtoturniphone14prosnapshotsintohighquality48mpheicphotos"
It was just added in todays release candidate 
I recommend Obscura
Ill be swapping a 12PM for a caseless 15PM Hopefully the weight difference is noticeable Id love a lighter phone
Sure is
100 the same If the standard 15 had ProMotion thatd be my phone Its just so hard to go back to 60Hz you somewhat notice the jump from 60 to 120 but when you go the other way is when you realise how massive it is
The 15 Pro is smaller than the regular 15 According to phonearena
Im definitely trading this phone in I dont have the snuff to buy one full price
Put on a display protector You can do it professionally in Apple Stores and get guarantee on any scratches or bubbles for free replacement
This was my first thought as well Im open to seeing how it is but I do imagine Ill miss the obvious physical representation
Same lmao
Get one from a reputable brand link Anker or Amazon Basics
On paper the 15pm is only weight less around 19grams compared to the 14pm But probably have to hold it in hands to feel the difference
"I believe they have an option to temporarily save to icloud for like 30 days so you can transfer it to your new phone or you can connect a cable to each other

All they do for the trade in is send you a box that you can insert your old phone into to send back"
"Probably I kinda like the white one And the pink Which unfortunately isnt on the pro max 

But I dont know I have now promax 12x and the cases doesnt really show my true iPhone color so I wonder if it really matters at all what color the iPhone has Maybe it changed over the yearsD"
The lily has pink color but pink int lily  but hey it always depends on advertising
"Well you lose the 3x zoom or 5x with the Max and Im assuming that means itll only do 10x max zoom  at the end of the day though I doubt itll make much difference if you dont shoot lots of portraits or zoom that often

Honestly if you care a lot about the camera get a dedicated point and shoot like a Sony RXseries or newer Canon Powershot Gseries Those will make any phone look like garbage"
They will probably come out with real colors for the pro in a year or two when there is absolutely nothing to entice people to upgrade
It only saves the last thing you copied and it doesnt save it for very long
I take it youve never had Softwareexe is not responding dialogue box appear on your windows machine Plus RAM related app closing happens when you leave an app not when youre using it
This has been a running joke on Reddit since that comment
Thats the joke
Amazing too
She can handle as many Ds as you can throw at her
Which is an interesting idea Our parents didnt have 4K TVs in the 80s and so were stuck with crap VHS recordings of our birthday parties This is a bit like the cart before the horse but it is interesting to imagine reliving a few years worth of memories once the Vision is more mainstream
Not really you cant prepare the future so far ahead
It wont as the margin Apple likes to get on products needs to be similar to an iPhone or else whats even the point for them to spend on something with low volume and low margin
Lmao what an out of touch comment
If you have to finance a consumer electronic you cannot afford it lmao
Sounds resonable To get it spread i believe it would have to be around the same price as oculus But its apple so the Vision lite will still probably be 1500
"It will be the same as every other appenabled device  iPhone Android smart TVs  the app store wont contain pornspecific apps but the device doesnt control what media you can view or sites a user willingly visits unless the user has added parental controls themselves

Does Android care if a consumer uses their device to access yahoo com vs bigjuicyboobs net

Does Vizio care if a consumer is using their Vizio tv to watch Pitch Perfect 2 or Backdoor Sluts 9"
"Yeah its mainly a joke but probably also a coming reality  Har har har har

But yes not about to be an immediate gamechanger plus the Vision Pro is still tbd and the price is pretty limiting"
But theyve done this before I remember this guy named Jon Prosser that had huge leaks I dont remember on what and after a little while he wasnt a big deal anymore because apple found out who his sources were and fired them
I think the GB ratio is cheaper with the larger capacity
" But keep in mind that photos taken on the new phone will be significantly larger due to the increased resolution

It depends on which model youre coming from but the resulting photo sizes wont change much since Apple bins its 48mp photos down to 12mp out of the box So in effect you get higher quality images that are going to be roughly the same size as it has been before with Apples 12mp sensors 

The only time it would really take up more storage is if youre shooting in ProRaw or specifically capturing in 48mp or 24mp mode"
VAT is included in the UK price so the full price we would pay is 999 for the pro or 1199 for the pro max no VAT added on top of that
That sounds about right Much better for the UK given that the 14 pro was 1200 1500 USD
Yeah its always been a bit more expensive
They need more phones with dynamic island so developers have a reason to make things for it Apple dont want a repeat of the touchbar where not many devs wanted to make anything for it because it was reserved to just a small handful of all macs The action button doesnt have the same reason to trickle down because its not open to developers so it may take a generation or two before they swap it out
Low sales for the 14 and 14 I guess They need to nudge the masses to upgrade their phones
This was leaked literally a year ago
They had very little to differentiate the 15 and 14 otherwise imo
main reason to get the pro imo is the 120hz display
Im guessing they wont trickle down any pro feature that has Pro in the name ProMotion ProRaw ProRes will remain pro exclusive features
"dont think the display will trickle down anytime soon The better display with 120hz and alwayson is one of the 2 biggest differences along with the 3rd camera 

If not for that how would they even marked a pro Its also perfect for proexclusivity because while cool its really more in line with a bonus feature than anything you absolutely need Nobody is too mad about it not being in his normal phone its still usable A lot of users prob dont even know what 120hz is And if you really cant do without well Apple forces you to go buy a pro"
Ill trickle down that guys wife
To me this alone is worth the upgrade to the Pro I can tell the difference and love it
Think its not gonna happen Triple camera and 120Hz are exclusive for the Professionals 
Trickle down features has been their new marketing the last few years
Thats a significant part cost increase though theyd have to raise the prices of the lower end device
ProMotion and the telephoto lens are the two things that arent going to trickling down anytime soon lol
I think this is actually one of the significant cost drivers of the phone tho and of course the titanium and cameras
I thought on Apples website it says promotion is on both models for the 14
I have never heard this Is this actually a thing Base models lasting longer
i feel like you added the bit in brackets just to flex that you know the word grawlix lol
" midnight green

Mhhhm pretty much Im a sucker for all the greens"
Second best after Purple
Whos they Where can I find a heavily discounted Pro Max Apple usually discontinues it as soon as the new one drops
Depends who is the bigger picture taker in the couple Almost always going to be the woman so makes sense
"I mean you care about them enough to be commenting about it in apple themed subreddit about its event lol

Just take the new phone this time your wife can upgrade next cycle Her phone is brand new"
Remember youre talking to children most of the time in this sub
Man wth and then we have our dumbass Canadian deals here lmao god
Do you have it Because for me its really useful Specially the apps tracking game scores and Uber eats
Yeah they will totally go back to a notch s
"no they wont because they arent allowed

instead they will do what they did with the iPad Pro  sometimes your brand new Anker cable wont charge the iPad until you restart the iPad but the Apple cables just work fine everytime"
Just false
"Youll get upvotes because this sub loves greedy Apple stories regardless of whether theyre true

But no Apple is a member of the USBIF and licensor of USBC and the terms of both prohibit that kind of brandlocked behavior"
nope
The EU will hit em with a huge fine if that happens
"They cant the eu specifically told them that they were not allowed to limit 3rd party usb cable speeds

 httpswwwmacrumorscom20230504euwarnsappleaboutlimitingusbciphonecableshttpswwwmacrumorscom20230504euwarnsappleaboutlimitingusbciphonecables"
Id feel better about it if they were clearly labeled
You can get 10 foot long usb c 20 charge cables pretty cheaply Happy for that too
They havent done it for iPads and MFI has always been about convincing people the certification makes for a safer and more reliable cable I would understand why they might consider trying that with charging speed but not data speed
also conveniently picking the midtier size lowest one is 69
Will the pro Max even use it
Well yeah but when he goes home opens a beer and hops on reddit to cosplay a power user he gets very angry at not having the option of shooting hours of video at 4K60 and transferring to the Mac Studio he would never buy because it has solderedin RAM
Guess maybe its Apples fault for gating consumer features behind the pro name
Yeah I like to think of myself as an early adopter tech geek and I think this presentation today has convinced me that the Pro iPhone is just not for me anymore Its awesome tech and Im happy there are people who can make use of it but its probably not mebut 
His life might otherwise be so boring Id expect him to do this sort of thing or other geeky stuff over the average young adult
"Well for me when I got my 11 pro max I just wanted the biggest one coming from a 6S

Ill probably get a plus next time"
So many people around here so excited for a different cable and all I can think is that I cant remember the last time I plugged my phone into any cable My phone may legit still be a virgin Fucking luddites in tech subreddits I swear everyone wants wired everything and I just want a thick heavy device is literally something people say around here regularly
Wild to me that this is a sentence in 2023
"A CPU designed in 2021 doesnt support USB30 

Wow
You apple fans are ok with this shit"
literally the only people who care about this are not buying base model iphone 15
"What i understood from the keynote is that the usb3 controller is in the A17 chip so it makes sense that the regular models with A16 are still limited to usb2

Most people never transfer data via cable anyway so who cares"
The controller is inside the chip if apple want to support USB 3 they need to change the current a16 chip
Uhm what Its a physical port How wouldnt it be hardware
"In the past they had the perfect combo 28mm and 55mm After that its only getting worse

28 to 24 55 to 77 and now 77 to 120

If you dont count the crop mode you basically only have 24 and 120mm now

Its crazy"
And that 48mm is already a cropmode from a 24mm FoV
Love me some loose lenses
Im not a camera guy so I was confused by their statement that the 15 Pro Max is essentially 7 camera lenses It was my understanding that it is only classed as an optical zoom if there is a dedicated lens for it  but they advertised 24mm 28mm and 35mm as if they were optical Is this not simply a digital zoom of the 24mm at 12x and 15x
Yeah same 77mm was my favorite focal length
Its a bug unfortunately mine says 100 too but theres no way its actually that and many people have reported something wonky going on with the Pro 14 on that front
Honestly As long as price is the same and I dont plan on keeping my phone for 1 more year theres no reason not to switch
"Theres a few videos I saw on twitter 

httpsxcomshishirshelke1status1701669946621845817s46tcxAbUTIl5umS6EzTFupA"
The listed values seem to be the same on their website I was hoping the 15 Pro would see an improvement to close that gap between the 14 PM Now Im not sure which to go with
at this point yeah it cant be as thick as the whole bump but it would definitely help if it was a bit thicker since it would make the bump smaller
And last for like 4 days
Itd probably last a week or two on a single charge though
Im kinda bricked up at the thought of that
"I wonder if they could use that prism tech esentially an applefied periscope lens on the other lenses as well and shift some of the size to the side thus making the bump smaller

Also you look at xperia pro phones they got pretty good camera tech  except in the AI and processing department  and they do not protrude like the iphone cameras do

So it should be possible but it would require an overhaul

Maybe in 23 generations at this rate "
Damn they did it the absolute madlads
Quibbling Didnt we get here by talking about making the phone thick enough to eliminate the the camera bump not just to arbitrarily be bigger than the previous generation phone
Apple is not allowed to satisfy us we will always ask for what we dont have Its in the sidebar rules
Based on what data something you made up
Four years caseless on 11 Pro Max and one or two scratches on the case aside it looks as good as new Some of us are actually capable of taking care of our stuff
Been using it without a case for years never had a crack
It feel nicer to use it bare and I get AC so Im not too worried
Its heavy for a phone
Everything looks like an AIgenerated oil painting It is getting farther and farther from replicating a real camera I had to pack my Sony camera for a vacation because I cant trust the iPhone to do a decent job anymore
Im at 85 after a year  but if the battery on 15 PM is the same as 14 PM no point to upgrade tbh
Same Hoping titanium makes a difference here I did the 13 pro when there were no differences and I missed the alleged longer battery life but definitely the big screen
its what im currently using been holding out for USBC
They made the 15 series rounder
Haha 10Gbps transfer speeds vs 480mbps isnt an upgrade Okay bro 
No kidding I heard that wasnt happening until the Elon Musk edition in 2030
Yes I was sharing my opinion
Same hereon XSstorage fullguess the phone has started to stutter a bitgets hotbattery is bad but can get the battery changedI was looking forward for 14 last year but didnt like the overall glass lookthink 15pro Id a much better upgradealthough I agree it was a lackluster event not sure whya17 has so much more to offer but the keynote down played it
Im on a X Max too and I gotta say I am very nervous about whenever I will upgrade I enjoy the unprocessed look of the photos I take and I see the overly processed photos of the 11 and up and it scares me
Am on 11 Might wait for 16
Nah Im kinda liking the thing I have going since I first got a 5s The every 5 model number count seems to be working well enough since each time the performance of the device really seems to be dropping off just before I upgraded
"httpspreviewredditfazwl8v6uvnb1jpegwidth828formatpjpgautowebps8d70fc5798a266c04978a7a8428b086a696c3d33

XR bought when they came out Debating if I wait for 16 Been playing this debate with myself for the last two cycles now"
"True  youd do better by just selling it manually though even after one year You can manually sell a base 14 Pro for 800 still and a 13 Pro for around 625

Upgrading every year also adds an additional year of sales tax and a carrier activation free in my case around 140 total that is a sunk cost because you dont get back either when you trade in or sell"
IMO the 14 Pro was a lemon release The battery life is definitely worse and the camera is way over processed outside of RAW A lot of the appeal for me to get the 15 pro is really just to get a more functional version of the 14 There could be some variation in specific 14 Pros though because some people dont seem to have the same issues
Hahawell usb ctitanium casing reducing the weightand a17arent just normal upgrades actuallyplus hearing it has 8 gig of ram
84 though Im an iOS developer so my phone spends a lot of time plugged into my computer and sometimes gets hot Never considered that as a bottleneck and havent paid enough attention to notice a trend That may be the culprit
Fair enough sounds like you do your part to get everything you can out of those phones
Theres a whole other shot on iPhone video uploaded to youtube also
Would love to learn more about this Are there downsides to anodizing or does it wear off What are the advantages of PVD that they went with
holds pretty much until you scratch it still theres lots of coatings for titanium like cerakote which holds better than anodizing
"The iphones no idea since they said they were not anodizing it but doing something else

Titanium anodization actually increases durability and if you do manage to some how get it scratched to death and back again while its a lot of work you can take the phone apart Once you have the titanium bits seperate you can reannodize it after buffing the original anodization layer away

httpsmonsterboltscomblogsnewsanodizedtitaniumhttpsmonsterboltscomblogsnewsanodizedtitanium

Heres all the different colours you can get"
Ooo youre right My bad thanks for the correction 
Nothing Im a bit dyslexic and some guy downvoted me for it
"I used to upgrade every year on Android because well they didnt last all that long at least not in my experience and there was typically new features 

That said I very likely wont be upgrading just mulling things over in my head Im probably more likely to put this money into a new monitor or improve my home server instead"
Yeah I saw that and while I do plan on staying with Verizon I dont like being tethered with an additional monthly cost over the next 36 months
if you want can you opt out and not upgrade and pay off the device
Good question I dont know off the top of my head I think it should be the max has seemed the same size to me since the 11 pro max
The exact body measurements are a bit different but yes the 61 diagonal is still the same
I looked at it on the Apple website Go to the model select view pricing and basically go through the motions like youre going to buy it After selecting the color and storage space there is a section for trade in and another for carrier pricing
Apple website has it iPhone 13 Pro Max for example is 1000 off either of the 15 Pros Might have to swap to ATT since Verizon has kind of sucked for me lately and their trades suck
I dont play games either but I think its extremely noticeable when just scrolling through social media and such
Is this not what I said
Getem King
Yeah it would be incredible I didnt even bother to ask them to double check that info lol
Legit Thatd blow my mind
Yeah definitely makes sense lol But still youd think that they would check the specs before saying 12GB RAM
I have a work phone with 60hz and using it is terrible
When you have them side by side its night and day
Oh that fantastic Thats one of the biggest drawbacks to shooting on a phone before
Theyre just jealous because they werent able to keep their 6s alive like me
Size not weight
Yeah good point Its not what it used to be anymore
"Yes I dont understand why people buy luxury products and hide them behind cheap ugly cover Its like buying a good car and than covering it with cheap plastic to protect the paint from scratches

If you are really paranoid about potential damage that will never happen anyway then get Apple Care"
Yeah this is the only reason I use a case Well that and because the bezels are now so thin its hard to holduse phone without getting mistaken touches or long presses on the sides
If you are reselling yearly maybe But going by the comments here a lot of people keep their phone ages At that point the resell value is shit anyway hardly matters if you had a case at that point
Not really Not like I use the phone while it lies on a desk
Is there not a real risk of damaging the cameras without a case Im inclined to keep it sat on its screen since I plan to try out the nocase experience for once on a 15 Pro Max
Yeah hopefully normal usb accessories will work as expected
Combined makes sense to me but youre combining multiple markets Which single market is bigger than the US for the iPhone
Yet here you are with Tim living rent free in your head Go take a picture of yourself touching grass
no worries I reached out to apple 120mm only for pro max due to the 5x but everything else is the same
" You get a third camera

third camera is also on the 15 pro"
"yet somehow they will manage to fit it next year like they always do

sensor shift on the 12 max only which then came to the normal 13 pro"
"ah yeah my bad forgot apple can change the physics of lenses a year later

strange that they dont change physics when it comes to the thinnes of lenses"
Yup
11 reg holdouts unite I can wait it out Treat myself to a battery Im sure apple doesnt care most people are still locked into their ecosystem even if they dont upgrade as often
Regular 11 here too I had no interest in upgrading but when I found out that the 15 will have USBC I knew I was going to upgrade
512gb pro max green gang but my phone gets uber hot when charging  the battery aint the same i think that natural titanium is calling me
What percentage did you end up replacing your battery at Mines at 86 and I have to charge it at least once in the middle of the day
Im at 84 and charging has become noticeable for me I cant get a full day in anymore
"It is 3nm They mentioned that specifically in the presentation

But regardless the battery life on the 14 Pro is better than my 11 Pro and I dont have a problem with the battery life on my 11 Pro Its performance that is the problem mostly because Im constantly running out of RAM

Also 5G and WiFi 6E hell yeah Ive got my WiFi 6E network ready to go"
Youre buying an iphone each year How are they making less if you are buying an iphone every time they announce one
Theyve been doing minimal improvements on the Iphone for the past decade or so why are you changing your iphone each year
The iPhone 45 and 12 are very different phone designs than the rest of them
The iPhone 12 was the last major design overhaul which was 3 years ago
Im at 81 myself Also considering the larger size this time so it feels more like an upgrade but not sure I am willing to give up some single hand comfortmaybe more annoying in shorts pockets Although I am seeing that even the regular pro screen size is about a quarter inch larger than the 11 so should feel nice either way
Mine is 100 11 Pro How could this be after almost 4 years of daily use
How to turn smarthdr off on 13PM
Yeah halide is a nice option for sure I am just lazy with the iphone and want to use the on board camera I have a mirrorless that I spend enough time doing edits
Im now wrong Im not sure about iOS16 but in iOS17 you can now swap between 12  48MB JPEG and RAW with a longpress in the camera app The JPEG48s are better AND smaller in Apple when compared to Halide now
I am not on RC Still on developer betas but maybe it was in that one as there was a release today
How many grams does your 12pm phone weight now with the case
thank you
I have 2 anker cables that suffer the same problem I havent tried Amazon though
casefree
"Thats a good point I also thought about getting extra camera just because I purely hate going on vacations and hideunseek my phone all the time zip purse unzip find the phone between xxx things put back hurt my finger with zip and 5mins again again  
I am not a photographer so maybe as long as the Pro camera is way better than my pro12max maybe I should consider just doin that Plus the pink But then the small size Its really hard decision

So what are you going to get "
I see thanks Yeah I agree with you that having a clipboard is pretty useful when pasting different repetitive things I just dont think it is a hardware issue but a software which relates to iOS
"Yeah I most likely never had those errors on the two Windows 10 laptops I used before switching to MacOS You know thats not even RAM related yeah So I dont know why you asked And yeah Im talking about when you leave the app to go do something else on another app You should be able to return in an hour or a day and still meet the app as you left it with the cursor blinking if you were typing something

I dont know what laptop you use that kicks your apps from memory the way your iPhone does That must be a most terrible experience"
Old film quality can be insanely good Couldnt enjoy it at all until HD televisions came out Its kinda like that
"Old movies and shows shot on film were essentially shot at something between 12 and 20K All that is needed to make them 4 or 8K is the financial incentive to do so

Go watch some 80s music videos on youtube that have been reuploaded in 4k  It will blow your mind"
Of course you can Thats why the vision pro exists in the first place
Dont cars fall under consumer electronics too Even coming from someone who doesnt finance anything not really sure whats wrong with doing so
If they could get it down to 999 it would be impossible to stock
if you are not gonna use them its wasted money
"My understanding was that 24MP would be the new default mode but I might be wrong there

Either way I think its likely that more people will be taking higherres photos now that you can get them without going ProRAW"
I know 1040 USD  20  1248 USD  999 GBP
The 14 pro was 1099
"The Touch Bar never gained traction with developers because the product didnt make any sense If you can type even a little bit the last place you look at is the keyboard And since you cant use a touch bar without looking at it it kind of ruins even the discoverability of the feature Its a power user feature shortcut that isnt useable by power users I guess the point was to bring shortcuts to non power users but the product concept is severely flawed at the very best

Not to mention that it breaks your at rest position The absolute worst is for IDEs where they got rid of physical buttons you can easily find without looking at them and rest your fingers on to step inthroughout for touch buttons that virtually useless for this task

And if youre plugged in to an external monitor and keyboard theres a good chance you cant even really see what it shows Granted I suspect this is the exception among apple customers but nonetheless it makes adoption that much harder when its quite literally out of reach of your users

Its mildly useable for volume control though the volume updownmute keys were clearly labeled always accessible and didnt need an extra tap to bring the volume bar so its still a massive step back The only use case I found is to autocomplete emojis but its not exactly worth all that effort"
They have a different reason to have it trickle to the iPhone Silent mode parity with other apple devices such as the watch Having it tied to a physical switch prevents users from using their watch or mac to silence their phones
"Leakers were also ranting about usb 2 speeds

I honestly stopped paying attention to leaks because its dissolved into rage parties before anything is any announced"
Yah I already knew 120hz was gonna be a huge leap over 60hz But man every time I turn on low power mode its so noticeable Even though 60fps is quite smooth
Didnt the iPhone 14 pro last year not get the 120hz
I agree  I have the 14 pro and it would be the only thing I would miss
I want the 120hz display but I also want the pink one not some boring gray 
"Its true

I would totally get the regular 15 instead of the pro if it also had 120hz"
Lol they mean the older Pro models are discontinued by Apple immediately after a new Pro comes out
they last longer on store shelves not to use lol Apple arent selling the 14 pro anymore but they still sell the 13 which is much older
Can we really blame him Great word
"Usually the carriers and wireless stores have some stock 

Last time I upgraded I got a discount on a 12 pro max the week they released the 13 

My intention was to get a 14pm when the 15 goes on sale"
Any good ones launch yet 
Its useless tbh
I dont watch other people play games I cook food But Yeah still more useful than action button
While I disagree with them the Dynamic Island is a way to make an annoying notch more useful I think that theyll remove it ASAP
Nah theyll go under screen camera like Samsung
" instead they will do what they did with the iPad Pro  sometimes your brand new Anker cable wont charge the iPad until you restart the iPad but the Apple cables just work fine everytime

TBF it never happened to me Im charging my Pro with all sorts of random USBC cables and they work every time"
Im entirely on Anker cables and have never seen this with my iPad Pro Perhaps you got a defective cable and interpreted it differently
Never happened to me I barely own any Apple cables only a usbc  lightning and a watch charger I literally cant charge my iPad with an Apple cable and never have an issue Id check your cable
There was talk about limiting cables but EU nipped that in the bud by having EU Commissioner send a letter to Apple saying that if they go that way theyll cop an import ban in EU
Valid I didnt even notice they didnt mention faster charging until a few minutes ago
Thunderbolt cables would work but be a waste as the phone will only use USB 3 protocol No need for a thunderbolt cable
Incorrect the description states usb2 speeds not usb3 speeds
but 120hz should be a consumer feature
It honestly feels like some people in this sub dont actually interact with people in the outside world If anything most users who still use cables will be complaining that they now cant use their old cables theyre not going to care in the slightest about the thought of being able to use USB 30 with the new ones
And 40 was out in 2019
There are 10000 cpus out there that dont support USB3 Many different classes of device include a pci based usb3 controller because that is cheaper than dedicating expensive die space on the cpu to a usb3 controller
Well yeah because they locked it to Pro models
Port and protocol are not the same thing The port is just metal contacts to a spec the data depends on the controller supporting transfers at 30 31 32 or 40 speeds
Would you mind explaining this in laymans terms I wish I knew what you were talking about 
"The only way I can think of to do this without straight up making technically false claims is to crop the sensor Same thing you have with DSLRMirrorless cameras

For example 50mm f18 on a crop sensor APSC canon camera gives you same result as 80mm f288 would on a full frame camera

Its not quite the same thing as digital cropping but its also not a straight up different lens with same sensor as their marketing would imply"
Losing 77mm is making me not wanting to upgrade Im torn
Interesting I have no reason to believe its less than 100 though Nothings wrong with it I only want the newer iPhone for the USBC but otherwise no reason to upgrade imo lol Loving the camera and its powerful enough for everything I need it for
Yeah pretty much Its basically the new iPhone with AC for half their price well worth it imo
For me personally the weight is a bigger issue than battery life My phone becomes uncomfortable to hold way before the battery life drains down
Because you usually dont have an opportunity to charge your phone before 4 days pass Lol If you want 4 days and a phone that weighs a pound just glue a power Bank to it
"Based on lack of sales and market for a nocamera smartphone 

If Apple could successfully sell a phone for the same price with less stuff wouldnt they"
Unless youre a photographer people use their smartphones as cameras Camera upgrades are one of the most talked about feature during every new release
"No Im not making any sort of extraordinary claim  My dude youre claiming that people dont care to have a camera in their phone and acting as if thats obvious

The overwhelming majority of iPhone users use cases  why on earth would those people care about their phone lying flat on a desk  I havent heard anybody talk about phone wobble on a desk for a good 7 years

Apple and indeed every other phone manufacturer dont do stuff based off no research If there was any demand for a flat backed phone then it would exist"
Well the phone is designed for a case they put it in glass so the case ecosystem will strive  I am glad you enjoy the sleek design so much you are willing to baby your phone but I know how much a case protects it and I will never not have a case on my iPhone
Yeah compared to other phones having a contest to be lighter Who buys a phone based on its weight
Okay so youre agreeing with me I too am saying that technology DOES shrink over time
What the heck are people transferring through their iphones Serious
Lol well bro Ive never plugged any of my iphones into a pc A lot of people dont So its an upgrade for certain people As far as an upgrade for everyone there really isnt any with this phone
Very good points
"yeah thats my point last time a dark color showed light color scratches it was called scuffgate and the color never came back

so they clearly dont want to repeat the dark color that scratches again"
Physical Vapor Deposition can be very durable  Its used for example on highend stainlessaluminumcore cookware such as Hestans Nanobond series  Of course anything scratches eventually with enough effort
What are you looking for home server wise I probably have it
I think you can pay it down to nearly nothing All works out to be the same cost And an extra 420 in this case greatly makes up for it
Yeah you can either just keep paying and itll be paid off in a total of 24 months or you can contact citizens and pay it off earlier
Ok yea so i see it says trade in deals with 3 carriers Says up to 800 for my iphone 12 But if i continue on down to replace this phone with my current phone on ATT it only shows 250 So maybe i need to go directly to ATT store to ordertrade in
Yes and no I thought you were trying to argue that the 120Hz is a reason to get the pro as there is a difference in experience although I read mixed things about this However Id argue if you dont go for the Pro route people would be perfectly happy with their 60Hz screen as they wont get to experience the 120Hz The bottom line being that it doesnt matter I know 120Hz is objectively better this is just a philosophical take I guess
I use my personal phone and my work iPhone 11 back to back all the time and have never noticed
Yeah I agree its noticeable but op makes it seem like its detrimental to their health
The iPhone is not a luxury product as much as Apple wants you to believe otherwise Not everyone who buys a 1000 phone is happy to spend hundreds more over the lifetime of the device on AC and replacements vs slapping on a 20 case
not sure why you noncase truthers always come in like this  SO many people drop their phones and want to preserve the condition and value of their 1000 item  its really not that hard to understand
Fair point but I you should also consider that cases provide more color options for example the pros this year are boring imo so Im skipping AppleCare abs getting a case and screen protector
"Youre misusing the word majority when you mean to use the word plurality

Edit love the downvote Stay illiterate"
What 
And it also has a noticeably smaller processor size
Thats a good point Almost as if technology with time continues to get more efficient and compact Likewhat do you want Do you get a laptop with 256gb one year and go this is stupid In a year memory will be more compact and I can get 512gb in the same size computer Because thats what your comment sounds like
"I think I did it at 85

From past experience when iPhone battery health dips below 80 all bets are off and the thing acts super wonky I didnt want to let it get to that point"
"And that was a repeat of the iPhone 45 era So what do you want the soapbar iPhone 611 back Theres not much else they can do and differentiating will be like splitting hairs

Regardless youre talking about literally the least useful change to the phone I find it absolutely hilarious how much consumers weight the aesthetics Like that is not even a feature we can talk about In fact Id say its not a feature at all"
Yeah you get used to it pretty quickly plus the extra size makes viewing YouTube games etc a lot better imo
My older brothers is on 98  but his average screen time is 1 hour 
I use mine quiet a lot with games Netflix and social media etc so they are pretty intensive that heats up the phone quickly so Im guessing battery degradation etc
Im lazy too The 48MB JPEG produces a nonRAW image that barely needs editing in Lightroom Phone does almost all I want so I dont have a separate camera
Oh I get it I was referring to that convoluted shortcut setup
Todays developer release is the rc
281g so Im looking at a 60g change Just not sure if thatll be enough to be noticeable I suppose 20 is a good jump though aye
But is it safeeeee
I did specially talk about the shitty home VHS camcorder your parents had access to not production grade film recording equipment
"No you cant Apple doesnt even support macOS over 10 years and too many things will change If you have a device in 10 years it wont be the same as the current one

Anyway you think you are right you can continue your dream"
"Financing necessities is fine And most people need to do that Cars houses medical bills sadly etc 

Even phones are a necessity at this point But if you cant afford to buy something like the Vision pro outright that is the furthest thing from a necessity you have no business buying it imo Same with the iPhone pro If you need to finance it I understand you may want to to take advantage of 0 or carrier discounts you should be buying the SE or non pro model cash"
You know what youre right for the Pro models 24mp is the new default out of the box So yea the higher storage will definitely be important
Maybe the price has gone up since launch It was 1199 for 128gb pro on apple website last week
Im fairly sure focus mode syncs between all devices thats not the same as the phone ringer yes but I dont see that needing control from other devices Its not like the Mac can change if the apple watch is on vibrate or not so idk why theyd do it for the phone
And Apple may be feeding nonsense to leakers because the price increase leaks were sometimes wrong
60 fps isnt super smooth to me
You could wait till next year then if you might only be upgrading
no way The 13 pro has 120hz screen Im assuming the 14 pro has a 120hz screen
tough
get a pink case i guess i dont trust the titanium to be good enough to go no case
Ohh lol whoosh
Thats great to know How good was the discount Ill check out my local ATT
Not yet will keep a lookout
Not if it has a function
And yet you give no reason to why I use mine all the time music airplay and other background activity I want to switch back and forth to
Dont hurt yourself with that superiority complex
Youre really cool for not caring about sports incredibly brave take
Careful you dont cut yourself on that edge
So your prior comment was bullshit as it has absolutely nothing in common with the Touch Bar
"Same here  I cook the shit out of it with my Lenovo USBC laptop charger

Im even using some 20 USBC china special for oculus to charge it with the 20W adapter"
Its a wise assumption but due to my job Ive constantly got brand new USBC cables from various brands at my disposal and they work without a hitch on all of my devices Mac included without a hitch  theres clearly a problem with the iPad but the Apple store refused to acknowledge it for 2 years so I gave up
"its not the cable Ive got countless new cables constantly around the house and the iPad is constantly a hit or miss as to whether I need to reboot it before itll start charging  these cables charge everything else in the house without issue MacBook included

Logic would dictate that the iPad was faulty but the Apple Geniuses insisted there was nothing wrong with it because their diagnostic app said so And the Geniuses are never wrong

Hopefully one day Apple publish a writeup on just how the Genius Bar diagnostic tool for the iPads USBC port works"
"Those are CPUs for industrial and enterprises

Your iphone is for the everyday man Different use cases Dont compare them like that"
What are you even using the usb cable for other than charging I will await your made up reply
"Exactly I write software Im not a complete noob

I just thought the USB protocol was pure software but I guess that is hardware assisted too"
"Ok you know that on cameras you just zoom where you want On phones you cant each camera in the phone is fixed to one view right This is why phones has 23 cameras

The angle of the view how much you see is expressed in a number called focal lenght 

So if a camera has a 24100mm it means that you can go from 24 TO 100mm So you can take photos at 3031325689ecc wherever you want in the middle

On phones you obviously cant if you have 3 camera at 1324 and 50mm you can only shoot at 1324 and 50mm

To let you zoom on the phone they add the digital zoom But the digital zoom like you can imagine is not a real zoom Its just a crop of the nearest camera If you have a 24 and a 50mm and you shoot at 30 you are just cropping a 24mm you are not really shooting at 30mm like on real camera

Now if you have a 24mm and you crop it to 2627 is not a big deal You are loosing quality but not that much and its still usable This is why if you have multiple cameras you should have their focal lenght not too far from each others

In the past iphones apple was using a 13mm a 26mm and a 55mm Like you can see the numbers were really close this means that when you zoom you dont really see a difference in quality because you are always near one the focal lenght

But now you have a 13mm a 24mm and a 120mm Between 24 and 120mm theres a gigantic gap This means that if you shoot at 70 or 80 the quality will be really bad

Sure you can shoot at 120mm but usually around 5080mm is what most people use all the time to make portraits 120 is cool on paper because is very far but you will not really use it a lot

So now to be able to shoot at 120mm they sacrificed the old 77mm that was where most people were shooting all the time"
"They zoom in digitally thats how they give the 28 and 35mm lenses


They zoom in and they say its acceptable because the sensor is 40megapixels And as their images are compressed to 12megapixels in doesnt change anything for them so they can give you new lenses


Its like last year when they were advertising the new 2x zoom on the 14 pro and pro max The sensor is bigger so they can crop and give you a 12 megapixel like the 13 pro and before image at 2x zoom"
Never skip finger day
"I see lack of sales for something that doesnt exist thats some brilliant circular logic

The camera bump started as something benign and now its absurd beyond ridiculous  People who are not photographers or instagram users just have to tolerate it because theres no iphone without it"
"Of course theyre the most talked about feature because cameras are on the phone and keep improving  Thats not an argument  If the phone had a whoopee cushion attached to it and it kept getting smaller more efficient and able to make louder and louder farts that would be talked about a lot too

That doesnt mean that people dont want a flat phone that can sit on the desk without wobbling  The camera relative to the rest of the phone is absolutely ridiculous"
"Oh I see because you havent heard about it it must not bother anybody  What happened to DESIGN  Steve Jobs would have thrown such a ridiculous phone straight back to the drawing board and you know it if you are even old enough to remember those days

  My dude youre claiming that people dont care to have a camera in their phone and acting as if thats obvious

My dude hundreds of millions of people go about their days without having the urge to take selfies  They would be content with a basic camera that sits flush with the case"
They put it in glass so that it can have wireless charging Plastic feels cheap and metal doesnt work with wireless charging
Where did Apple ever say the iPhone was designed for a case
I transfer my photos and videos I use Proton Drive and it doesnt have a photo sync option yet
"Any time someone mistreats their phone and damages it they add gate to the end of whatever they did and whine about it

Since you clearly dont even remember if they made any successive black phones it was probably resolved

I had a black 5 it was fine because I didnt treat it like shit"
Currently I have an unRAID server with a Ryzen 2700x Id like to upgrade it to an Intel 13400 for quicksync Plex transcoding Thats about it though everything else about the machine is great but Ive noticed some higher quality streams have had some hiccups lately
For my carrier that deal only qualifies for newer more expensive plans Unfortunately my old grandfathered plan doesnt qualify so no soup for me
Thanks for the response Sounds like a no brainer then to me
Thats because when you do it with ATT you sign a contract to use their service for like 36 months  With apple they just cash you out no strings attached
Really Its like night and day to me
Obviously new iPhone Pros are luxury products Why would you think otherwise If you want a cheap phone that does its job then get a cheap phone
Yeah and nothing happens if you drop your phone as I wrote You all are just paranoid
Sure if you want other colors go for it Everyone I see usually just rocks some kind of ugly leather case or black plastic ones It just degrades the good design so much its horrible in my opinion
didnt iphone 12 have sensor shift only on the max and then it came to the normal 13 pro
"11pro 74 right now can confirm

Also 64GB is killllling me"
The great thing is that the people who actually make these things arent you
It will be noticeable for sure My Mom has a 14 Plus 203g and it feels like a feather compared to my 14PM 240g If you are on the fence just go to apple store or best buy to see
My bad  Youre 100 correct then  Oddly older home film cameras shot in pretty good resolution although the optics usually sucked
What the hell are you talking about lol iPhone 15 can already shoot spacial video Its not going to change from now to then
Dont bother with explaining to people who think financing a VR headset is normal
"If there was significant interest involved Id totally agree but like you mention its at 0 APR If youre paying via Apple Pay youre even getting 3 back

For those who cant directly buy it rn but could by saving 300 bucks each month for a year thats pretty much equivalent to financing it except you get to use it a year more"
"The pro max was 1199 the Pro was 1099

The launch priceshttpswwwtelegraphcouktechnology20220907iphone14releaseappleeventfartimelatestupdates

In fact its down 60 at Currys and John Lewis"
Its rather annoying that the Watch controls all of your iPhone statuses except for Silent
"Ye you right I meant apples 60 fps I own a 360hz monitor and switching to my phone wasnt too bad imo like on my X Until I got this 13pro I think I need 120hz for any future purchases now Idk about 90hz cuz Ive never used a 90hz display before 

Not sure how much more 30 frames will help but I bet its still noticeable"
"I just wanna trade my current phone in while it still has a pretty good trade in value iPhone with USBC would also be a big convenience for me I think this looks like itll be a pretty solid generation of iPhones just judging by the announcements

Edit but yeah I might just wait another year"
Weird for some reason I thought when the 14 pro came out it wasnt 120 must have been a dream I had lol
13 Pro does have 120 Hz It was the only reason I upgraded my 7 
I forget now but it was a few hundred dollars
Who said I dont care about Sports I just said I dont care about watching other people play sports like fat losers do
"The everyday user doesnt plug their iPhone in for data transfer either All wireless 

The userbase for highbandwidth wired connectivity on a phone is very very small"
Do people really use a cable for file transfer with their iPhones I dont think Ive done that since the streaming music industry took over pirating music Since then why would you ever plug in your phone to do anything other than charge
"This is the real answer here Werent like all lightning cables USB 20 speeds Pretty much no iPhone users use the cable for any kind of data transfer

Now android users who want to try iPhone may be pretty annoyed by that The real annoying thing is how much would it have really cost to put in USB 30 on those other phones Like pennies

Guess they have something to upgrade next year"
"Yeah I get the argument that USB 30 probably costs next to nothing for Apple to include but even next to nothing adds up at the volume the iPhone is sold at

And realistically who uses USB to transfer data tofrom their phone these days Id bet your average consumer doesnt even realize you can do that let alone have a use case that warrants it Everyone just relies on the magic of iCloud"
Every now and then I pirate an audiobook and transfer it thats about it Theres no real need especially with iCloud
"Ok so on the 15 pro its still 13 24 and 77 only the pro max is 13 24 and 120

Which makes me think that for the 16 or 17 probably 16 the iPhone will have 4 cameras 13 24 77 and 120 At least I hope because the gap is just too big to be acceptable and they know it

Theyre probably doing the same thing that they did a few years ago testing a new thing on the pro max before brining it to the pro which sells a lot more"
"Considering my phone is so heavy youd think my hands would be able to crush steel 

Nope just arthritis"
Dude you might be the only person on earth who doesnt want a camera on your phone Just letting you know
If no one cares no one would talk about them and companies wouldnt spend the money in RD to improve it A whoopie cushion lmao yeah I guess theres just no use arguing with some people Maybe you ought to apply to the major smartphone brands since you know better than whole marketing and data analysis departments In an ideal world of course we want thinner phones but physics isnt really accommodating People want more capabilities for their smartphone cameras so the optics have to accommodate for that I design medical microscopes for a living and there is no way to make it smaller unless you want to go back to 2010 specs Youre in the far far minority of wanting downgrades in camera quality Good luck with your search for the unicorn phone
They have been designing their products for cases ever since the iPod
"what the iPhone 5 color never came back

maybe you dont remember

httpswwwcnetcomcultureiphone5sayhellotoscuffgate

scuffgatenet cant believe this is still a thing lmao"
Oh nice Dont really have any consumer grade stuff
"Its rather liberating I dont really care about small scratches I can hardly see because they dont effect the value and I know Ill be getting a new one soon 

Plus Apples loss and theft insurance is much better

It is an expensive way to own a phone though"
Do you watch any cartoons  Theyre only 24 fps
"An iPhone lasts way longer in terms of OS support and hardware compared to a cheap phone iOS 16 is currently supporting iPhone 8 released 6 years ago Furthermore luxury is very subjective in an age where dresses costs 10005000 and handbags reach 20000 An Audemars Piguet which starts at 17000 which the buyer will wear occasionally is a luxury product A 1000 phone with a unique OS which will be used every single day is not

Buying a 1000 device which will last you for five years on a dailyuse basis seems like a joke of a luxury when you go out and see whats being bought right now

Regarding the cases part I want my investment to last long just because I can afford luxury doesnt mean I want to risk accidentally breaking it and pile up repair bills up on my desk Most people who own Rolexes and Ferraris dont treat them like shit they treat them carefully"
please video tape yourself dropping your phone on to concrete from standing height
Check with Apple I have no idea
What the fuck is that even supposed to mean lmao Of course aesthetics are important to market a product but you the consumer are literally basing your entire decision on it That is EMBARRASSINGLY stupid
Certainly not on the fence Just excited for a shiny new toy Thanks for the perspective 
The difference between 60 and 90 feels a lot bigger than between 90 and 120 but the latter is still noticeable
Horny
Jesus Christ man Im not a sport watcher but thats just a shit take You remind me of this video httpsyoutubea8VBNRtnJbYsiR812ezkEREYy9kWP
"Apple is literally advertising iphone 15s best mate as the MacBook pro lol

Theyre pushing you to get into their ecosystem

Dont try and spin this shit dude USB 20 in late 2023 is unacceptable"
Do you read on the kindle app or another book app
"the whoopie cushion was a ridiculous example to illustrate that of course the most talked about feature would be the one that is the most focused and prominent  I guess it went right over your head

I dont care what you design for a living the camera bump is absolutely ridiculous  Somehow over the course of this phones development way after Steve Jobs somebody decided that the primary role of a smartphone is to take pictures  Thats fine and all but we dont all need the most incredible camera in the world in our pockets

The physics in this situation is irrelevant  They could make up a different iphone model put a less capable camera on the back thats flush with the service and hundreds of millions of people would buy it"
"They made two black versions of the iPhone 7

I remember Cnet always being desperate for clicks and reporting on pretty much anything people whine about on twitter  Bendgate was similarly a nonevent  As was antennagate"
No this is just scrolling and using the phone normally Even when my 13 Pro Max goes into battery saver mode it caps back down to 60z and the FPS is unbearable
Maybe stop treating your iPhone like shit then There is no reason you need case unless you throw your phone around for fun each day They are robust and dont get damaged by daily usage at all You are paranoid about potential damage for no reason
"Of course I might get a 15pm from my 14PM just for the native shooting 48mp in heic and a new marco mode which I use all the time Not 100 sure though as my 14PM is amazing and the 15 is not much different

I dont drink and hardly go out or spend  so it is my one splurge yearly"
Jesus Christ isnt real dude Also thats pretty cringe video
"yeah and how do you think youre supposed to use it with the mac

Not with a cable you can airdrop files back and fourth handoff for apps wirelessly accept calls and text messages and a dozen other such things

Im not trying to spin anything youre just completely misrepresentating reality and thats a problem regardless of what your opinion on this specific matter is"
I used PDF Expert for the few digital books I had to read for my masters but otherwise Im an audiobook  physical book person
"yeah jet black isnt anodized black considering one is glass and the other is aluminium

httpswwwextremetechcomdefense136835applerespondstoiphone5scuffgatescratchesandchipsarenormal

httpswwwmacrumorscom20120925philschillersaysiphone5scratchingnormalforanyaluminumproduct

https9to5maccom20120925applemarketingsvpcommentsoniphone5scratchesandchipsthatisnormalforaluminumproducts

antennagate wasnt real they just moved the antenna lines on the 4S and gave you a free bumper case for no reason

scuffgate wasnt real the anodized black color of the iPhone 5 never came back for no reason 5S was when space grey started no

bendgate wasnt real they just made the 6S a bit thicker with a different aluminium thats heavier for no reason"
Maybe I dont notice it since I havent gamed since xbox360 really
Fun questionwould you rather use a 120 Hz 460p display or a 1080p 60Hz
"Maybe stop treating your iPhone like shit then

Maybe comprehend paragraphs before giving your advice Its about risk not as solution to a problem 

 There is no reason you need case unless you throw your phone around for fun each day 

Until theres that one day it slips from my hands or falls when someone bumps into me or many other scenarios

Why are you so paranoid about what other people are doing with their own property"
Yeah thats why the video reminds me of you Especially this response
I aint airdropping a 2gb video file Are you dumb
"The iPhone 7 also came in flat black and it was in fact all aluminum  Im not sure why they stopped after that  Its entirely possible those had durability issues as well  I had Jet Black which did great aside from picking up a few scratches on account of the gloss

My point is that I owned all those phones and the complaints about them affected a small number of users in a mildly inconvenient way and were resolved quickly in successive revisions  They were barely newsworthy and certainly not some kind of scandal worthy of a name"
So you actually think the phone breaks by just dropping it Spoiler it doesnt Cases are ugly and useless Nothing more
iPhone 7 normal aluminium black color wasnt the same as the anodized black of iPhone 5
Scratches Dents Bumps Are you now arguing phone covers dont offer any protection against these effects
"As if you arent triggered because someone says using no case is better Actually that whole thread started because people apparently are mad about me saying cases are useless You could just have not answered my opinion post

Also stop editing your post after someone answers to it"
"Lets stay on topic rather than going over if youre mad or not

Scratches Dents Bumps Are you now arguing phone covers dont offer any protection against these effects"
They dont offer enough protection for how ugly they are Dude iPhones are high quality products They dont easily get damaged unless you try it I think putting ugly 20 cases on 1k devices sucks The phone doesnt get any meaningful damage you  guys think it does
"They dont offer enough protection

Considering ugliness is subjective and something thats your preference at the very least youre on to the fact that they do offer protection Which is the main reason most people who dont buy it for aesthetics buy a case This answers your question why people are buying them"
I know why people think they need them and buy them Still doesnt mean I understand them or think its good to do Which was the whole point of my initial post people apparently have a problem with As I said its the same as putting ugly protective cover on other luxury products Sure it protects them Still stupid in my opinion
Hello I have 2 questions 1 I want to switch from Android to iPhone but I dont know when Christmas or should I wait for the release of the iPhone 16 then the price will drop I hope 2 Which model should I choose for my first iPhone iphone15iphone15proiphone15plus Thank you in advance for your reply have a nice day
Biased Paid by apple
I will miss lighting connectors Physically very sturdy and solid I hate that piece of hanging connector in the centre of the usb c hole   I feel it can break easily
Est bien el botn pero no sabes si lo tienes en silencio solo con verlo como en el 14 tienes que pulsarlo para saber cmo tienes el telfono por otro lado la cmara y la lmpara es sper fcil abrirlos si tienes el telfono listo para tomar una foto no cambia nada hacerlo con el botn o deslizando tu dedo en la pantalla
Hii bro samaung s23 and I phone 15 which is the best create compression video
My current phone samsung s8 has the bixby button which acts basically like that action button one press for the bixby assistant or you can change it to a browser or  if I double press I can pretty much launch any app youtube any game of choice social media and what not
So nothing has really changed since the 13
Debt thats it
Nothing really difference from iPhone 14 max pro
Increble
Im in Team I Dont Care and sticking with my iPhone 14 Pro I feel that Apple is becoming lazy with these updates

Idk why people watch this guy videos In every single videos he just only tells the basic things of the smartphone 
My 15 pro max is overheating and feels easy to bend Can you comment on the inherent design flaws How about the overheating I have seen the jerryrigseverything video and it is terrifying So far most reviewers seem tethered to Apple and on the positive side Like ads
Android users Do we really need an introduction for Type C cable and its data transfer 
Nothing much other than usbc congratulations iPhone
"Havent you been able to remap the Bixby key on Samsung phones for many years now to handle other functions USBC  Thats old news and has been out on Samsung phones for 5  years APPLE  Still finds a way  to rip you off by making you get their special USB typec charger Those phone has titanium its lighter and breaks easier 20 improvement from the old iPhone A half ass Zoom camera Wow these are some revolutionary changes to the aging iPhone while my Samsung s23 Ultra is still fresh and amazing

Im sure Ill pull Fanboys are frothingatthemouth and well still be suckered into waiting in line to buy this phone Bad news though the people at foxconn and China Ive quit their jobs and iPhone production has been cut by 50 iPhone Fanboys will have to wait a very long time for this phone now They never have a problem justifying their ignorance so this is nothing new"
JUNK
Thanks for the video and coverage kinda a teach  junkle so I like to check in and see whats the latest and whats changed among the newer version of the phones
Im all in for the iPhone Pro Max but since its such a delay to get one and the new rumour out is that Tesla is coming out with a new phone so I dont know I guess Im gonna wait is the Tesla really gonna come out its been coming out for the last couple years still hasnt come outso I guess Ill wait until Christmas and then if the Tesla phone doesnt come out and I dont see no reviews on it then Im all in for the iPhone Pro Max
OMG the fact that the camera you used on the plane shows way more definition and contrast and clarity in sharpness than the studio camera youre using to make this video DO TELL What camera was on the plane
Maybe time to say goodbye to my XS Max
"How many years Apple took to adapt to type C Pathetic as usual
Apple is always behind And if you ever feel like a moron remember theres people who buy iPhones Phones that claim to have next level features which competition had for ages like that HTC phone Still getting smashed no matter the titanium frame which is one of the main selling points  Jesus Christ if one exists have a mercy"
Clearly they held back fast charging for next years turd phone Aka the same phone with one new thing and a better camera
Cmon Marquez whats your verdict on issues 15 pro max  seeing a lot of issues ranging from heat to bendgate  etc
It seems that there are Iphone 15 ProMax overheat edition and Iphone 15 scratchedfromfactory edition which one do you like most
Im here on my iPhone 11 totally happy 
Im using both the 14 Pro Max and  the new 15 Pro Max Face ID is not working since I downloaded ios 1701 on the 14 Pro Max and updated to 1702 on the 15 Pro Max
the fact its usb c 3 and not 4 is crazy
1106 Neil Patrick Harris 
I am upgrading my iPhone 13 to 15 Plus  The reason being 15 Plus has a bigger battery and now going to use the Dynamic Island the camera has better quality than then iPhone 14 Promax so this is a really big upgrade for me Apart from this pro models are specifically for those who are more into photography and vlogging
It is just usb C though and they didnt even want to
"Here is what apple needs to do to become acceptable again or what I would do if I ran apple

Bring back headphone Jack

Punchhole camera and face id built underneath

Be more honest and vocal about specific changes such as purposefully slowing down battery and causing it to drain and to stop slowing down old phones

Bring back the switch thing and put the action button below the bottem volume button

Allow for rcs and to make android people communicate with iPhone users with ease and no trouble because apples fault

Allow users to customize their screen any way they want 

And lastly I would bring back replaceable batteries or the removable backs of phones and allow users to manually put it a new battery with ease



Let me know how you feel about my decisions as apple ceo"
Samsung features I miss Categorized messages and delay message send Please Apple I need those two things 
5more years Ill up grade to  another iPhone   My 13 is still perfectly fine  lol
Marques is so rich even his pillows have iPhones 
Im getting one since I have the Iphone 12 and the TYPE C alone sold me Bonus points for better camera
I positively LOVE my 13 ProMax and am getting a 15 ProMax because I can upgrade around the time of new release Its already ordered I just like seeing the fun stuff people find lol
Apple is so predictive these dayssamesamesameeven the price
Apple is so predictive these days
"Not just type c but overheating cracking  battery drain  name change are the best features 

Cant wait to get my hands burnt soon "
Sir one phone pleze
Im sorry but there is absolutely zero care about what kind of charger i stuff in to my phone
Is it a major upgrade from a XR
phone looks cool not going to upgrade until my iphone 13 that ive had for a little more than a year till it dies then ill upgrade
NEVER MINDITS STILL USELESS
Just picked up a new one today and youre hit the mark on all points great review as usual man and the anchor stuff is really useful as well Keep on rockin
Ohhh Apple reluctantly forced into adopting USBC by the EU after having customers beg and plead them for it for years and now they make it the defining new upgrade of the iPhone 15 
I will wait for the iPhone 16
14 pro or 15 pro which is better
They selling yall the same shit 
""
Nice
Switching from iPhone 13 to iPhone 15 pro good switch
I liked the lightning cable Shame it couldnt be changed the other way around
Cant wait to get the 15 Pro and now that you mentioned the camera difference will likely get the 15 Pro Max  Glad I waited to watch your video before buying
I would rather keep the switch and have the action button in the middle of the right side of the phone
Same phone Not surprised though
damn i loved the mute switch very easy when im in a meeting and forget to mute my phone
Awesome phone
As per usual another good video
Im coming from a X XS Max so getting the new Pro Max will be a substantial upgrade 
Pro RAW Camera stollen from Samsung S23ultra  it comes with an inbuilt Raw setting
Time bucks
"First of all thank you for this review

I was shocked from a trailer to see how many photo abilities it has But now hearing its only on pro max I aint interested anymore"
So glad I found your video Immediate sub I dont usually chase the latest release but titanium caught my attention Thanks for letting us know the upgrades are minimal
Awesome
I really want to get a new phone mainly for the camera features but not sure if I get the iPhone 15 pro Max
A lot of people dont no this but this but the pixel 7 has an alternative to the action button by tapping on the back the phone you have a shortcut You can adjust tap speed and sensitivity in settings
I am happy with my i phone 11 and really 15 didnt impress me yet to upgrade 
like who cares about the speed transfer 99 of users would only need it to transfer data from macbook when buying it and thats it
That is Assam good
They didnt go all out in hopes to get people pissed off at the government to reduce restrictions
Lol they put limit on USBC Charging Really CMON
14s they are losing what made Apple great but thats what you get when youre liberal Steve Jobs would fire them all
still got my 11 pro max apple hasnt convinced me to upgrade
Not just typec  only type c  same build like 12pro max  and no diffrent camera  position and design nothing worthy  Only i cloud bypass  Uuh why not 
Beautiful phone
Marques why isnt there a new iPad this year 
i saw a guy on tiktok who recorded you he was also filmimg
Closed Caption kind a not sync or different cc at all
Theirs no Black SMH emoji
Why doesnt Apple have a black SMH emoji 
Only switch if you have an iphone x or older
Somehow there has been essentially zero change since the iphone x
I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max and Im not sure if I should upgrade or wait It still works pretty good but it definitely has been glitching more lately
I have an XR and Verizon is offering me like 450 on an upgrade so Ill probably take it I generally wait 35 gens last upgrade was from a 7 to this one Ill probably take it before they wont give me anything on an upgrade lmao
"Would the Pro be an upgrade from my XR

Cant seem to want to part from the XR"
Oh wow an action button Thats how I know theres nothing amazing about this phone when thats a talking point
Mechanical tech never made a biological soul a better place
Apple controls the feeding of the crowds trust meall giants come tumbling down eventually
I still dont understand the hype around iphones
Phone technology has almost plateaued there is not enough new exciting features coming out every year to warrant a yearly upgrade I have the 12 mini and still have no intentions on upgrading
Apple new Iphone Same as the old Iphone 
Im glad I started off with android Either Apple just doesnt care about improving or they have to get permission from Samsung first to use tech features Something going on that we dont see Apple already gets its screens from Samsung so its things we dont know I know if you love the iPhone an upgrade to another iPhone is pointless right now
This will sound crazy but Im likely going to early upgrade simply to be able carry one cordUSB type C All my devices are usb type c so apple is long overdue for the iPhone Otherwise theres no reason to upgrade outside of this
they didnt change anything basic version of iPhone 15 is like iPhone 14 Pro but more expensive Europe and less features
No mention of 60 HZ and 6 GB of Ram
nice content
Apple is so mid When are you going to get the features Android has had for years 
Thank you
LOVE IT 
Im gonna make a guess iPhone 15 Pro A17 Pro Chip will be iPhone 16 and 16 Plus and Marquees will highlight that
It seems like you hands are made to hold smart phones every phone looks beautiful in your hand
So I will stay with my 12 for now until some more improvements will be made
Apple reverse engineering Android technology
why talking about finish when liturally almost EVERYONE puts a case around it 
Great you got the 60hz
"By the looks of it the only difference for me as a 14 pro max owner is
 the 5x telephoto 3x seems to work fine for me as I never really needed to zoom any further than that
 usb C port
 screen brightness
 chip which probably isnt even noticeably faster
 Titanium build
Probably more of a difference than the 13 pro to 14 pro had from what a lot of people said wasnt much at all but still not justified imo Great video btw"
"Only thing I want that short cut botton to do is turn on and off my GPS location without having to open my settings and toggle it off 
Android has it Sure makes using some apps alot better I dont want my location on at all times"
Just ordered a 256 gb Pro in natural titanium switching from a S21 and pixel 7 pro before I killed it I debated a Pro Max for the 5x but did want the extra screen size see the dead Pixel 7 Pro I have a hard time holding too large of phones and thought Ill probably use 3x more often than Ill u se 5x 5x is kind of too much for a lot of my kid pics Color and capacity were largely chosen by what was shipping soonest
Fast charging degrades battery life exponentially
Good
I think its underwhelming but thats because we are so used to it all now Not like the days of the past when they made groundbreaking innovative changes
I have a 12Pro so I think its time to update I held off on the 14 series because I knew the usbc was coming however I thought it would be a thunderbolt Im kind of disappointed however I only plug my phone in like 1x when I first get it to sync my iTunes music because I have a bunch of music that I like to keep on the phone
"The worst scam which Apple has ever sold us after Steves demise is that darn Dynamic Island shit 
I am dead sure he would not have allowed a hole in the middle of the GUI"
MKBHD is HIM Always stayed authentic and gave his honest opinions on devices I remember when it was majority android at first then started to dig into apple and he wasnt afraid to poke fun at them for certain features so glad this continues today as I believe it holds apple accountable and actually pushes innovation for all of us consumers
Reason for Commenting on your video is so that you can make a video on this and apple might consider your video and do some changes on calling screen or bring back to previous screen
"I get that its not a huge upgrade but Im such a pathetic Apple Sheep that I went from a 14 Pro to a 15 Pro Max 

I couldnt help myself"
Phone evolution has reached its pinnacle All the ideas are exhausted Phone companies are not releasing exciting features
So I still have the 11 Pro and probably should upgrade now lol
Por que me sale en espaol estoy confundido
Im happy with my Iphone 13 pro maxim may change to the new Samsungwill see but im sure im not getting it
I bought this new iPhone Pro thinking that the new usbc would make it easier and faster to download content to my PC but instead now it even worse Any recommendations
620 my iPhone 15 Pro charged from 20 to 85 in 25 minutes with the iPad charger and iPhone cable
Meet the new iPhone 15 the same as the old iPhone 14 I cant wait for the Rob Job video
I love iPhones 
Thanks for the review Im going to hold out for a few months to see if the 15 worth it I currently have an iPhone 11
Always a let down with iphones gonna switch to s22
You speak slowly and clearly and your thoughts are organized This is a great example of how to make a good video
"the only real benefit of using titanium frame is to make a lighter phone
smartphone frame never breaks ever
not even the cheapest plastic"
5x optic zoom  a feature that Huawei had since 2019 At half rhe price 
Its an absolute joke that the USB port is stuck at usb 2 speeds USB 3 has been around for along time now
adds a camera 14 changes the charging port15 add more colours 16
i dont like made in india low quality  o dont buy iphone in made in india bad
if you already have an iphone 14 dont buy this if youre looking for an upgrade from any iphone below 14 you should probably buy the 15
Hey Marques  not sure if you noticed but probably mention about the new cable that comes with the iPhone 15 pro max A slight change from the old latex one Probably more durable
Im getting the pro max I keep my iPhones forever I currently have the Xs MAX so this will be a big upgrade for me The last time I upgraded was from the 6 
Word is the European Union will require all phones tablets and cameras to use USBC for charging before the end of 2024 Apple didnt want to change they had to change Or not have their phones sold in EU countries
Im trading in my iPhone 11 pro for the iPhone 15 standard iPhone  The iPhone 15 pro and pro max was 40000 a month for payments
Ok so no fast charge Ill wait for the iPhone pro25 to upgrade the kids iPhone 6s 
The evolution of smartphone notches has been quite interesting over the years iPhones introduced the concept of notches setting a trend that Android devices quickly followed However Android took it a step further refining the design by making the notches smaller and introducing innovative variations like the teardrop notch and punchhole camera displays Interestingly Apple chose not to directly copy Androids advancements and stuck with their notch design for a while To cover up they introduced a feature that some critics argue was more of a gimmick than an innovation the dynamic island which when you think about it is essentially a stretchedout pattern resembling a punchhole camera iphone never want to accept defeat and come up with bullshit stuff to keeps the fools occupied for a couple of years literally any android phone can have a dynamic island anywhere on their screen 
Still waiting on wireless reverse charging
Ive gotten a new iPhone every year since the beginning I may have skipped one year  not sure Anyway I think Ill skip this year Big news for me since Im the ultimate fanboy since forever Are we at the end of what can be done with phones The only KILLER feature would be if Siri knew how to run the phone with all 6 zillion options and no excuses
im upgrading from a 3 year old 12 pro max to the 15 pro max i couldnt be more excited honestly
Just got my 15 Pro Max on Friday and I Iove it so far
Sensational
It is essentially iphone 12 with USB C port and same design There is nothing else apple can do with the iphone  Steve Jobs is no longer with apple therefore apple cant invent anything
Bro have you given giveaways like in recent days in one or two mkbhd
this cnt is defo being paid by apple 100
same dam phone lol
"15 Pro is a scam at this point nothing justifies upgrading to it

 You get a weaker case back so youll break it more often just so you get to pay only 200 for repairs it was done on purpose
 PVD coating scratches off on the slightest nick taking away the quality feel of the phone
 USB C introduced right after the EU threatened Apple to ban their products
 No fast charging LOL even shit chinese brands have it on their mid range phones

Skipping this for the S24 Ultra lol"
So Ive been looking hand held gaming for a while and the resident evil 4 remake footage was really impressive Also I heard that apple has a new porting tool to port windows games Thats wild to me Again all of this stuff is in its infancy but its still really exciting to watch
I love that Apple made a phone that wont charge on any wireless chargers or car wireless chargers because of the camera Even without a case on it wont charge unreal
Im a SAMSUNG customer now BYE iPHONE 
"yikes 6core cpu 5core gpu only 6gb ram and only 128gb storage im sorry but that is just abyssmal for 1200 computers mop that easily and yeah i guess different platform different use but if your only caveat is mobility for such lowintensity use you shouldnt be paying so much for so little 

they advertise it as being able to run modern games but thats negated by the fact that it doesnt run on an OS supported by 99 of developers and even if it did you can buy a computer for the same price which does it better a 1200 computer in the modern day comes with builtin wifi 16gb ram 8 CPU cores and 2tb of storage thats more than enough to run modern games in 4k with 100 fps gaming just isnt something that phones should advertise imo because itll just lead to disappointment"
Man listen I always used both IPhone and Androids I liked the IOS in the past5 years but in the past 2 years I dont see any reason to buy them anymore they are simply outdated no fingerprint scanning together with face ID no multitasking needs specific cables until now when they finally got the USBC which everyone has already  screens made by Samsung huge prices for no reason  the 15 is same like the 12 IPhone died with Steve Jobs man 
"Guys I have an IPhone X since release I am someone who never changes their phone unless it dies because there is no real point other than answering calls or checking emailssocial media for me anyway I was thinking of buying the new IPhone 15 pro or should I just buy the 14 Pro Max instead My issue with the max is the 67 inch size I prefer the 61 in the hands and pocket 

Would appreciate any feedback"
Hey marques Big fan from India  appreciate the work you have been doing keep going Just curious if you did ask apple why 5x zoom was added only to pro max series and not pro series iphone
These phones are to big Im not sure why Apple offeres two large phones which is fine by memakes sure I dont spend money on a phone I dont need  Also Apple let us disable the damn camera short cut on the lock screen  So with the action button there are now 3 camera shortcuts  lmfao
USB 30 capability With a USB 20 cable in the box Gotta buy the USB C cable pro lmao Bravo Apple
Worst iOS update  Pathetic calling screen
So its the same
Iphone 15 has bad back glass
Today I decided to go from iPhone 13 to iPhon 15 Pro There were a couple of reasons First being the NFC functionality no longer worked So cant use Apple Pay even if I wanted to There were a couple of instances where that wouldve been handy as I didnt have my cards on me Second being the phones speakers kind of stopped working for calls unless I put it in speaker mode A third might not be an issue with the phone but the GPS would suddenly get stuck for me at random times Hopefully that wont be an issue with the new phone A nice bonus will be the nicer cameras and better battery life
They do have wireless reverse charging but the software doesnt support if you plug in your cable directly to iPhone with the MagSafe battery pack itll be charging both
I have the 14 pro max and was excited about usbc but I think Ill just wait till the 16
As an Android user for 4 years Im officially leaving Android and joining Apple  because of the new charging port Great Work Apple
apple is really making me think about switching to android
Wow USBC   It must be called iMagic  If thats revolution of smartphone 
Q get an iPhone Pro for photography VS  getting a cheaper iPhone and a top compact Sony camera There is something about dedicated devices then again iPhones are  good cameras now Decisions
Only two things if they happen to be on the iPhone I would buy it tomorrow and change it for millions 5000 the size of the battery and 120W fast charging that charges the phone from 0 to 100 in 15mints  like Xiaomi
Why does USB C fall out all of the time Its trash
"While the iPhone15 seems great I would like to tell you all why the iPhone 11 is better

We all know that apple has been accused of slowing their phones down when a new one comes out2 years ago I was showering and left my phone on the counter  All of a sudden my phone was buzzing because someone was calling me  While someone calling me is normal what happened next is not 

For some odd reason I left my phone on the edge of the counter and when it buzzed I heard a loud plopping noise  2 seconds later I realized it fell into the toilet I frantically jumped out of the shower to grab my phone from the toilet  I expected it to have been broken but when I took it out of the toilet after an 8 second swim it was perfectly fine No technical sound or physical issues with it  

So next time you think about buying the iPhone 15 remember this story of the my phone that drowned The iPhone 11 still provides quick internet a high quality camera and everything the iPhone 15 has besides new and exciting marketing"
iCrack is hilariously brittle
"Great Video as always 
As Im rocking an iPhone 13 Pro Max right now Im not really inclined to upgrade 
The main reasons for me personally would be upholding the value by uptrading as currently the 13 Pro Max is still worth a good amount of money
And the other reason is the camera 
Sure USBC is nice and all but it also means as you mentioned that all my accessories are pretty much useless now or I need to buy adapters 
With no faster charging mentioned it also doesnt make a big difference anyway The faster data transfer speeds aside 
So yeah again mixed feelings and will only upgrade if I get a good offer through my mobile provider"
Everyone is excited for the same phone every year nothing but bots 
14 pro max or 15 plus
The GOAT never missed 
all this talk of new features buttons nits not one mention that it is still at 60hz what a sellout
Nice video
Ill keep my 14 pro for now
All I needed was information on the usbc but I learned so much more Thank you
I hate that apple caved
I miss when we all used to get excited about new iPhones its been a while
Bro if i ever win the lottery my whole family getting straight up iphone 15 pro max in SECONDS EXTRA PROTECTION
the iphone 15 adds features that have existed in android phones for the last decade and pretending its an innovation
Nice the video
I like it
"I cannot care less about upgrading Ive used my iPhone 7 since 2016 and just recently bought an iPhone 15 standard Im just here hoping its gonna carry me through another 7 or so years 
"
Im excited about the USBC mostly I bought my 15 Pro this morning and this is a game changer for me
Same shit different year
USBCs been out for more than a couple years Almost 9 years now but nice try
Go sheeps buy the same iphone and spent your money to make apple more rich 
Jonathan Ivethey need you
I think Apple reached invasion wall
435 maybe they plan on making a regular A17 for the next basic Iphone lineup 
I bet you my iPhone 6 2020 can do just as much is the iPhone 14
Great post Im so tired of reviewers acting like every new item is the best thing in the world and causing consumers to waste money Thank you so much for being open and honest about the iPhone 15 Pro Max so now I can really decide if I even think it would be worth upgrading from a 13 Pro Max
meanwhile me with my iphone 8 plus  very nice
I expected already for years a holographic screen possibility and a high quality beamer with a strong battery and storage space
I feel like smartphones are becoming like cars Most people know what they want out of their phone Theres definitely enthusiasts out there but most people just want a solid foundation
So probably time to get rid of my iPhone X
Its only worth getting every third generation of iPhone they never change enough to quantify upgrading yearly
Apple  professional late to the game scammers 
Was hoping that cinematic mode got 60fps but it didnt so this year may be a miss for me
worlds most boring colors unfortunately
So let me get this straight the USBC charger will be slower than the Lighting fast charger that can be used for the 14 and also the 15 wont be compatible with the safewireless charger 
i like your voice
I get 1000 off the new 15 I have a 12 pro max Im just wondering if its worth it to change now or just wait and few more years I am worried about that radiation thing that came out
I am going to upgrade from iPhone Xr I cant decide between 15 and 14 Pro I dont care about usbc all my other apple devices and people around me have lighting Any ideas for which one to go
Wallpaper pls   
I just ordered a 15 Pro to upgrade my older 12 Pro  Three generations of upgrades will make it worth while and the battery life on my 12 was starting to suck
thanks black phone man
"Does the iPhone not already have fast charging 

My Anker GaN charger takes my 13 Pro Max from dead to 50 in maybe 1520 minutes If fast charging is faster than that holy shit "
Anyone know how to make my new iPhone 15 to turn off fully it is still on I turn off my phone and it just goes a little dark
Im sorry Nothing apple has done to this phone with what Samsung has been doing for years Not impressed
A new invention that will replace the smartphone is coming
You think in future iPhones the action button will also turn into a finger print with a action button 
They finally caught up with most of the features that are common on android
Welll done Marques 
We hit the peak of innovation on phones Its sad to see but Im still optimistic that some genius out there aliens will bring new technology
So I have an 11 I have a deal from my provider to get the 15 for pretty cheap its just a matter of which one I want
title is just a lie
Crazy how the new old charger was so hyped up lol
It seems like Apple is trying to play catchup with Android Its good that Apple is finally adopting in phases over a few years for everything eventually the standard of USB3 type C But I wonder if the cameras on the iPhone 15s topoftheline can even come close to matching the cameras of Samsungs Galaxy S23 Ultra Ive heard the best the iPhone 14 Pro could do with telephoto captures of the moon was a fuzzy greyishwhite ball while the S23 Ultra can get clear crisp details like the mare and craters of the moon Still its interesting to see what Apple is getting up to these days
"845 I remember when I used to have a xiaomi mi 9
Really loved the button that you could program yourself"
Thx for the video and coverage Kinda a tech junkie so I like to check in and see whats the latest and whats changed among the newer versions of the phones having seemingly just gotten my 13 promax I cant really justify getting another 1200 phone for awhile but its still good to see the latest developments in apps QOL chip performance etc
WOW  Marques en espaol sin duda este muchacho es bueno en lo que ase  En sus palabras no deja al espectador confundido sino que queda orientado  a tomar una buna desilusin por lo que es de gran utilidad su aportacin Gracias amigo
Apple is getting boring to purchase right now
"Honestly if any maker could have the ecosystem design even same pricing but would stop doing the updates that change the look and use  software totally fine and make enable the phone last 5 yrs without slowing to a snails pace Id change over buy lunch 
Tired of having to get a phone every two years Tired of having to relearn my phone after updates Just keep it simple please 
As soon as I retire Im going flip phone with no apps  Ahhh I dream of the day"
Good video
They should try curve display also
kanker dik
Probably the most honest and knowledgeable tech reviewer on the internet For years
USB C and a true black color are reasons enough to upgrade for me 
Guess Ill wait next year for the faster charging and ultra power saving mode
Im a sales rep and I was thinking the same not a lot of new more similarities Im glad to see most people agree I did learn some stuff watching this video thank You
Thanks again
Turning on a flashlight  from the lock screen with just a push of a button is worth the total price of mission for me You know what Im saying actually Marcus youre awesome Youre the best tech review guy in the world in my opinion
Forcing Apple to abandon their proprietary competitive advantage is simultaneously awesome and tyrannical
what a dissapointment the new iphones feels very cheap and have that plastic look
Wow a new IPhone with a brand new chip Did anyone see that coming 10 performance update Mind blowing USB C because people cant afford buying apple cables after using all their money on the phoneamazing This is the best release yet Cant wait to see what the iPhone 16 has in store Im sure they wont make that one with an even more powerful chip
Was this feature removed in iOS 17 Im getting No results when searching by date This would be a COLOSSAL failure if they removed the ability to search by date granularity I can only search by month now
All these things samsung has had for years
Laughable iPhone Switch to Android that is the simple solution Apple just milks its customers
Totally getting one
Woah facial hair  Im getting old
Do a drop test I bet you 10000 that iPhone 14 pro is strong then iPhone 15 pro You dont want high brightness it kills your battery  how much does a apple paying you to say what you are saying do some tests and actually review the product in stead of reading user Manuels and paraphrasing it 
Nothing about the refresh rates Does the regular 15 have 120hz
im so sick of the bump bruh
I want
Boring
So basically we stick to the iPhone 14 Pro still Dont see a lot of difference apart from the Zoom and Ctype charging which is not as robust or NO FAST CHARGING  I really expected 15 Pro to have more 
I bought the15 pro max  but I dont know if I should keep it or sell it please help
The Australian model still has a sim tray 
TiPhone
Getting and iPhone Pro Max  Im due for an upgrade I upgrade my phone once every 5 years
My iphone takes like 30 mins to full charge idk what ur talking about 12 hours to charge
Pink one giving off Camron energy
bought iphone 15 pro max it says it comes in ocktober 17
I like both Apple and Samsung Currently on an iPhone 13 Pro which I will be keeping until it dies But most likely will move back to Samsung unless Apple actually makes significant leaps rather than what other phones on the marker have already achieved They are lacking for what you actually pay for But great review 
Have a 13 pro 15 pro isnt worth the upgrade If Apple decides on a satellite mobile phone then Ill nudge
"They made the back more replaceable because they know that they could lose the European market after their recent legislation

I can tell that Rossmann will sound happy hearing this"
Smooth  60hz  no fast charge no nothinglol The new iphone gives nada Atleast you got usb c and usb 3 now thats been around since 2008
celulares que jams tendr en la vida y menos tenerlo de lanzamiento xs so sad
Im in the camp of Im really tired of Samsungs products not working as smoothly and seamlessly as Apples and Im willing to buy an iPhone just for the ease of use
Yes am for the new iPhones especially the 15 Pro Max 1TB Solid memory memory memory U are welcome to send me one if you wish Loving the new features and YNot just enjoy them
I feel sorry for iPhone users locked into this proprietary restrictive platform watching each successive device becoming more expensive and more inferior compared to stuff happening over in Android land And when Apple are forced to use the same charging socket as every other phone in the world they still find a way to screw over their loyal users by gimping data transfer speeds I wonder what Apple has in store for users when theyre forced to support user replaceable batteries because theyre not going to let that opportunity pass without being assholes about it
I really miss the mini version I own a 13 mini and i really hope they are gonna bring it back one day
Please somebody write the link to download such dunes wallpaper
You can love apple without pretending this phone has literally any features that make it substantially innovative in literally any way
First day we buy a new phone we gone put a case on it how does it matter 
Bruh are you getting paid by Apple Damn you do the same video every year
They were forced to use the USB C that the whole world uses Same shit different year
same speeds as a lightning cable tho
The Google Pixel has had these features for yearsjust dont see these iPhone versions are worth upgrading
this new iphone is CRAP
Skipping this Gen my 14 pro max after 11 months at 100 battery health beside still not changed much looks like a 12pro so not in a rush as not come on leaps and bounds
Thanks for sharing such nice pics
Im planning to switch from android to apple but damn I dont think I can wait for 1 and a half hour fully charging a phone but Im really liking the design in natural titanium
Its the same damn thing but with another kind of charger making it a pain in the ass for all my other apple products
Nice Review Thank you
Very interesting
The 12 makes sense to me it restores the old 28mm focal length that some prefer over the slightly distorted 24mm focal length
nice
USBC capped at 480mbs Apple is stupid as always Isheeps like Marques doesnt mention this
The 15 is the same as the 14 same as the 13 same as the 12 and 10 WASTE OF MONEY
Nobody is going to talk about how it is made out of titanium
Of all the tech videos especially iPhone ones i always rush to Marques Brownlee Detailed and sort of marketing Love it
usb 20 for a 799 Phone xDDD i cant stop laughing
Must buy I skipped the 14 
WE MAKIN IT OUTTA THE SWEATSHOPS WITH THIS 
up
fu
the
shut
ACTUALLY BRAGGING ABOUT USB C HAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHA REALLY THATS WHY YOU ARE CALLED SHEEP
Would you say its even worth getting a regular iPhone 15 not pro or iPhone 14 pro is better
Which of Gods favors are you denying
idc
No innovation Nothing
can someone send the iPhone background from the video
Action button menu looks weird Hopefully we will get a simple list in future as an option
I just realized how many other things have to get changed if you buy the 15 your air pods case definitely cuz the case you had before was definitely lightning cable Than the air pod max The only thing thats left is the watch with the weirdest charging adapter of all time I dont recommend that for apple users you dont need your lightning cable but you still need them for your air pods air pod max That doesnt make sense They definety take that in mind if they bring the AirPod max 2 out but still you would have to buy everything to totally replace that cable
Nice content
"Apple Fan boy including Marques  Everything that can be invented or added or improved has been maxed out 

Marques What could Apple possibly introduce in the new iphone"
So many innovations  wow nothing new looks the same 
Semi fast atleast 
YeahhhIll be waiting for the review before I make any decisions
So if the iPhone 15 and 15 pro have the same screen but the 15 is limited to 60hz would it be possible that Apple unlock the refresh rate via software update What do you think 
So literally no differences still 60 htz and a REVOLUTIONARY NEW USBC PORT that has been used by all the phone for years now
Where can I get that wallpaper
Ive always wondered what happens if everyone stops buying iPhones Would they release the actual technology they have They seem to be giving out crumbs I might get it though
in the END OF THE DAY We will put a case on it 
Broi I need a iPhone
Always making us better buyers with more information
I think Im going to keep my 14 Pro for another year Doesnt seem like much of an upgrade
Ive been using Android all my life well I bought iPhone 6 many years ago and after one evening with it I became angry and took it back to the shop the next morning and now I really cant decide between buying Samsung S23 and iPhone 15 Pro  and also Pixel 8 is coming soon Guys maybe you can tell me something I would appreciate getting constructive thoughts from someone who used both Apple and Android IOS
Nothing Wow I was expecting an Apple pen stuck to the side
Spanish
I had no interest in the 15 since there wasnt too much of a big change Usually I skip a year and I would have updated to the 16 pro max However with all the problems I been having with my 14 pro max and apple not doing much Im forced to switch to the 15 and pre ordered mine Hopefully its worth it
Looking forward to Apple quoting MKBHD during next product launch with This probably wont make a real difference to most people its kind of a bummer
It  never takes two hours to charge a iphone
Just new CPU for more power processing a little bit upgrade to the camera and USBC and the rest is just the same Not worth the upgrade of the amount of cost If u guys are reading this just dont buy it My humble opinion cuz I have a 13 Pro Max
My conspiracy theory is that Apple is using the slower charging slower data transfer versions of USBC so when they inevitably switch to portless models they wont have to be like oh btw this is gonna charge much slower than before Shooting themselves in the foot now to make them look less bad in the future
Going from an iPhone XR to a 15 Pro This is gonna be some upgrade
Im really starting to see what Apple is really doing here I used to be one of those people who said all Apple does is give u a new camera and now usbc but what they really doing is making huge upgrades for the Apple universe and they have consistently forever They upgrade the camera just to keep up with android also the front screen Sorry and the chip in the phone I have realized 90 of the people who own iPhones really dont know what all it really can do I like to research phones so I know I never get the new iPhone every year I wait 2 or 3 years Right now I have 12 pro max and Im gonna get the 15 pro max so that phone to me will be a huge upgrade over my old phone
I have the 14 pro and Im really happy with it Im hoping to hop over to the 16 or 17 but the newer phone is really exciting
I think I will stick with my 14 pro max for now I usually only upgrade if theres a big speed or battery upgrade or if the camera is much better Right now I dont see anything being a bigger upgrade over the phone I currently have Thank you for for the great review as always
steve jobs is spinning in his grave apple is a joke I recently upgraded to 14 pro and with this sort of pace apple upgrades its products my next upgrade will probably be to 18 pro
Note Lightning port devices will get obsolete REALLY fast
38k likes for 1 comment  Thats impressive ngl 
you didnt mention the refreshrate on the regular 15s really dissapointing
Wow i fking hate USBC always breaks when you use it Keep the lightning
Them shits look just like the 12  call me when them change the design
can anyone help me get that wallpaper
im sorry but I have zero interest in getting a new phone honestly I wish I had a blackberry
Its not a bummer that you get USB C without its benefits its a dck move Thats apple for ya
Quick question Do either of the Pro versions have the ability to record to external SSD drives like T5 or T7 Samsungs or is it just the ability to mount the drives and access the FILES folder and transfer after the fact to them
"TLDR  Apple is adding things to the new phone to catch up to Androids old technology again

Summary

Apple implemented an action button that Android has had for 10 years

Apple got rid of their dogshit lightning connector and moved to TypeC but only the Max version has a USB 30 controller so youre still on USB 20

Newer camera and processor from the last model marginal upgrade that typical Crapple sheep wont notice

Once again they allow Android to dominate the power usermultitasker scene in mobile smartphones But hey Apple still has a great ecosystem "
My 2018 Camry uses an Apple lighting cable to transmit signals to Apple car play on my car If I buy an iPhone 15 pro I need to buy a new charging cable one side is USB A which connects to car and one side is USB C connects to the iPhone 15 Will new iPhone transmit same signal to the Apple car play on my car
Very luxury Phone beautiful
People are MKBHD are the reason Apple is not pushing themselves further because creators are still appreciating mediocreincremental upgrades
Where to find the wallpaper in video thumbnail im an Android user want just the wallpaper please
Imagine having USB2 speeds in 2023 lmao
800 phone in 2023 with 60 hertz lol Only Apple sheep could not think that is joke    Apple definitely knows their customers well to not only do that but purposely  make it so transfer speeds are identical to the older port even though its being replaced with a newer lol I mean it that isnt a our customers mindless buy  no matter what we do statement not sure what is 
341 already in Android 
I mean I have a 12 pro max I think its a no brainer to go with the 15 pro max
Getting the 15 in pink for the wife  So excited about the USBC charging port I am on Android she is still rocking an iPhone 8  so this will be a massive upgrade
Thanks for the summary
MKBHD was actually an event at the main eventSHEESH
Fa
Also the action button is literally just the Bixby button Samsung had on the s10 I think
I feel you always lean towards Apple so it was refreshing to see you dog on them a little 
The reason there is no new fast charging is because they NEED something next year to say is new and worth buying a new phone They intentionally hold things back for use the next year
By the way now all the tech dummies will say that apple invented usbc
Does the music on ITunes play louder threw headphones and Uconnect
Can we at least get the thumbnail wallpaper please
People who use iphones 
Why do ppl still buy that Its extremely outdated
For the price you would think they would use the same  sapphire glass they put on the Iwatch 
Manufacturers of ALL products have figured out they can continue to pull in billions in sales and profit by incremental upgrades to whatever is manufactured Even if its just cosmetic The way its done  By continuously pushing the mindset of the consumer through culture and advertisements to believe to feel relevant successful rewarded and fulfilled in life they MUST have the latest model of everything Its just that simple
And im here still using my iphone 8 that works perfectly fine
Why are some talking about no changes were made IMO the design changes for the pros Titanium the new button and the USBC charge thanks to the EU are the biggest changes to the hardware since years I really consider to upgrade from my Iphone 12 now
Thanks for the amazing review The rumored USBC charging on the iPhone 15 is a big deal  thats one of the main things that would get me to upgrade from my refurbished iPhone 14 I just got from Phonebot Im keeping an eye out for the full reviews to help decide which to get
On the new A17 Pro its interesting to take a look at the Luke Miani video about it apparently the CPU is the same as A16 the novelty comes in the rest of the chip
Long live European Union
The way you pronounce words is phenomenal Extremely articulate Mister Bravo
202 From this angle the iPhone now looks like another Android phone
u can still be alive without an iphone
"As an Android user
USBC as the main new feature but ko fast charging and no high speed USB on all phones is in my opinion just embarrassing"
Wallpaper 
The action button is in depth Dawg all those things are like normal button shortcuts
Where can I find the Anker shown at 1224
i am sorry but it looks the same as 14 pro max nothing changes much

2 hours For fast charging mine charges in 30 mins mate
Wow  this my dream but I dont have chance to get it iPhone is the wold thanks for this advert
Nahh no iPhone 15 trash
Is it just me or does the random zooming in put off everybody
Off topicapple not releasing more color options to the apple watch ultra 2 seems like the biggest fumble of an opportunity imo
Waited a year to up grade my 12 PRO due to lack of USBcC support  I love the flexibility of a hub with the USBC and the speed that I get on my iPad Air Gen 4 HDMI USBC Compact Flash SD USBA etc  transfer any device to any device  Finally on the iPhone  My iPhone 15Pro 1TB is due to arrive on Friday 922
All the rich people are one One coin heads and tails Technology and education is really educating people thats why they are panicking
Great video What Im hearing is its a good upgrade from like a 12 but otherwise the same phone as in the last years Its sad that the top phone on the market is missing baseline features that the competitors have had for years fast charging USB3 speeds good battery life assuming there is no major difference from my 14Pro Been an Apple guy for 15 years now but the only thing stopping me from switching now is the cost of switching  iOSMacOS I dont see the added value anymore from the device
The phone industry has really run out of ideas as someone who loves tech nothing I have seen this year has really excited me
I was hoping for someone to find uses for the Dynamic Island now that all of the phones have it but I guess not
"First USBC phone was when 2015 right
Good to see Apple innovating on this in 2023
Thanks European Union for the being the parent Apple needed lol"
At the event are the phones placed on a XL Apple polishing cloth What is between the phones and the table
Getting one but need to learn how to use it to the fullest ability to get the most out of it
Saya tidak mengerti bahasa inggris
Apple made in China or No
"Heavily considering to upgrade my 11 pro max  to the 15 pro max my only thoughts are which color and which capacity with the photos Since I would like to use a higher quality photo format possibly Im wondering if the 256gb will be enough or if I should go for the 500gb 

In the same sense my 11 pro max only has 64GB and thats been fine this whole timeuntil now capacitywise haha"
Yes Its just USB c
Im sure you know but Apple was forced to by the US government to change to USB type c Thats why the changed
Just ordered mine Ive been rocking an 11 pro since release and have owned literally every iPhone before that going back to the first one Given that track record its felt really weird using an iPhone several generations old as Ive always had the most current This was the first iPhone in a while I felt had compelling enough changes to switch Ive been really wanting the new cinema mode and was hoping wed lose the dynamic island but the USB C was enough to send me over the edge
You are the BEST in a sea video commenters reference new iPhones  tablets  etc their very good and bad points 
Great Video thanks Yes for me it is a no brainer I ordered the 15 Pro since i am still on 12 Pro this has many new upgrades the reason I didnt get 14 Pro was i hoped the 15 Pro would introduce USBC  So for me the Pro is perfect i do not need the extra zoom and the size of Pro is perfect for me Look forward to other videos
I wish the fingerprint reader came back
how u turn off the excessive radiation
which video camera you use to shoot this video
"Im glad the 15 is cool piece of kit but here in Japan the Pro is 250000 yen which is over 2500 A grand more than the 14 Pro Max Insane I think the US prices are little more digestible but were talking highend laptop prices over here Its crazy

Either way Marques again coming through with the quality content"
i died with all the memes
Im still using an iPhone 8 It could benefit from a battery replacement but its otherwise still a great phone
13 pro Max for one more year
I preordered mine Im getting mine on Monday or Tuesday
Im still on the iPhone 8plus  any phone is an upgrade
Usb has been around longer than last few years also base model ipad already has usb c 10th gen ipad got rid of home button and added type c
Apple and Samsung need to start skipping a year  instead of a new same phone every year in my opinion
I have 14 pro max zero reason to upgrade
iPhone 15 is a budget version of 14 Pro made from garbage
Sit still looks the same 
Imagine being a trillion dollar company and being deranged enough to use that power to rip people off for even more profit with the maximum margins instead of helping fix the world God bless america
So basically no change looks like my 14 pro max will still be viable for the foreseeable future
528 What an insult to the consumers using 20 yearold tech 22 yearold tech on a premium phone Not even fast charging Nothing new from the rotten Apple brand
The 1x 12x and 15x options are not meant to be for shooting in those multiples of 1x if you notice in the settings they have their lens mm equivalent next to them Its for photographers who want to shoot at a specific lens size
TLDW Too Long Didnt Watch  Basically the new iPhone 15 is pretty much the same as the old versions with some minor upgrade to the camera and change of the charging cable connector  Other than that theres pretty much no reason to upgrade
bro is making videos like he didnt just win audl championship for 2nd time in a row without dropping a game
Soooooo same as 13 and 14 Thank you  next
The 128gb wasnt capable of doing ProRES and ProRAW so thats my guess as to why its been removed
Hi Im Tim apple We know how much you loved last years iPhone so this year we didnt change a single thing about it Its now 500 more expensive too
One cable to rule them all one cable to screw your prior investment in all your charging crap
Me suscribo por el Espaol Pero esta voz es humana o de pc
They brought usb c cause they had to they didnt want to
iPhone is a joke switched to Samsung and will never go back
My 12 pro is more than enough for the next two years and I dont see much of a difference between them
How long is the cable Is the same one as the iPad Air usbc cable
Not Just USBC but USB20 too Thats literally a 23yo technology in 800 phone and thats a step forward AND YOU BUY IT D
13 pro here Still dont want to update 
Now all previous iPhone users has to throw their lightning charger in the trash cans but can get almost 99 of same features as previous iPhone models with higher price 
Was that a GFX100 II I saw someone holding at 1124  
Who is watching this with iphone XR
Basically nothing new beside the usbc 20 and usbc 32 I was looking forward to buy it But thanks I changed my mind 
Plz bro am not a follower anymore but just plz wow us with your reviews if you keep reviewing the iPhone you just typically giving us the same review with miner updatesyour not going to agree but the iPhone is not that guy you yech reviewers just wont admit it
Can I charge my older AirPods which are lightning Im not upgrading them just for a case With my USB C  lightning iPhone cable I currently use for the 14 to charge the AirPods off the iPhone 15 pro max
If they add fast charging now they will run out of new features to add for next year
"pro tip If you have a 14 pro thats paid off then take advantage of ATT free upgrade promo Ive been doing this for the past 2 iterations of iphone Get the pro keep it for a year trade it in for a 1000 credit get the new phone for free just pay the 65 tax rince and repeat 

Say you hold onto your iphone for 5 years then after 5 years you want to upgrade to the newest 1000 phone Math shows that yearly your paying 200 vs 65year doing the above tip 

factor in a new screen protectorcase too"
I am NOT plugging my android into anything with an apple logo unless there is nothing else I can do These chargers are slow and you cannot trust apple to not harm anything non apple
"Apple You can play Resident Evil 8 on your phone
Marcuss reaction Meh"
No real direct criticisms presumably to maintain that Apple Event Invitation Such as sticky relationship to navigate with these companies Gotta get on the hype train but not level too direct of a criticismonly infer they should have done better
So they finally switched to usbc but no new charging speed or transfer speed What exactly is new about this phone again
I like the assurance that the phone is on silent mode the old mute switch gives I would have preferred Apple retaining the visible indication that the switch was on while implementing programmable functions
When you have to dig deep and mention the sneaky updates because there was literal no change from this years new iPhone lol
the anker sponsor is crazy
YES Not just UsbC 
Im not sure why people like iPhones over Samsung galaxy phones
All that yapping
Wallpaper in thumb
notice how he doesnt call this a review he wants to wait till everyone else uploads so it doesnt compete with his views
USB C iphone welcome to 2014
Is there ever going to truly be a new iphone
Marques good stuff I love how you ask the tough questions Im on a 12 pro max and considering Trade in price is still decent 600800 and will be much less next year What do you think
Im just gonna get a new case for my Iphone 12 Pro Max and call it a 15

What happens when you connect the iPhone 15 pro to a usbc dock or external monitor
Man I remember when I got my first iPhone Everyone had a 4 or a 5 I HAD A 6S bro I was talk the talk of the town Yall remember 3D Touch
And please dont forget to do camera comparison video between upcoming Google pixel 8 series and I phone 15 series
You had to show that you travel in business class now 
The nonpro iPhone 20 will still stuck at 60hz 
Nice USBC The only upgrade Ive been looking for since that plug became the standard
They should put thunderbolt 4 
Excelente la voz en Espaol para los que no entienden el ingls 
Gaming on iphone may make we switch back fo iPhone That was bug for me hopfully dev teams keep up with ghr iPhone updates and make games on iPhone incredible
"Same thing like 12 pro max apart USB C and much bigger price 
No thanks 
Proud owner of Motorola edge 40 pro with a 125W charger in the box 
Apple would do better if they switch to Android or even better to Harmony"
where u get those cushion covers from lol
My iPhone 21 months old iPhone screen went green and no proper support from apple in India  I had spent 70k Indian rupees for this phone It is not worth to spend 2 weeks of time and run around them to get the green screen problem corrected  Got it done from 3rd party for 85k Indian rupees Will never buy apple phone ever  You cannot spend 70k and see the phone display going dead in not even 2 years  Looks like apple is trying to sell its new model by creating display problem in its old model phones  Highly unethical company  if that is what they were trying to do This is the second iPhone am seeing this problem  earlier with my iPhone 6 model We cannot keep pardoning them and buy their phones even after these kind of issues
Just wondering what you recommend Upgrade from 14pro to 15pro and series 8 to Ultra 2 Thank you for your information and opinions
Does iPhone 15 have 120Hz refresh rate like 14 pro
They should have offered a sandblasted titanium That would be sweet More prone to scratches though
"I have a 14 pro
Apple gave me an almost this year so Im passing
rooting for something more
btw iOS 17 is a boss upgrade
Better sound quality for airpods pro 2 lovin it"
Coming from the iPhone 11 Pro Im all in lol Finally 5G 
Bro talking bout he needs to review the new stuff on promax to see if it worth it this man is such a sell out and a shrill now Man wouldnt even admit that apple is losing innovation with the iphone Im glad i unsubscribed from this shrill years ago
Already ordered the Pro Max cannot wait for it Coming from a 13 Pro it should be good
Damn Marques your videos are so darn good
Lets make a button that can be a shortcut for anything the user wants but lets place it in the most uncomfortable place   Apple
The USBC port is not a voluntary feature for the new iPhone European Union issued a law which forces all manufacturer of electronic devices to use USBC So Apple was literly forced to use this port which you can recognize in that sadly minimum of love they provided in the USBC features
13M views in 6 days Damn son
I can say everyone agrees that this was not an event  I might switch to an iPhone because my contract is up But there is nothing new here
Great video
I have an iphone se 2022 I just might upgrade for the 15 pro
Samsung already has that feature wayback 2019
People will buy it because its apple and Im one of those people
I need to upgrade so its good to know that it has some really good features
They save the fastcharging feature for the next time they dont know what to do next and call it lightning charging or so
The USBC is mainly for people who want to use this phone as a replacement for their DSLR and connect to external USBC hard drives to record content on to directly Great video highlighting the new technology Huge fan of your channel been following for a awhile
Not sure if it is worth go for change from 14pro max to 15pro max I would love to see camera videos first
"What Ive come to learn about Apple products
1 Expensive because of little things
2 You need a friend or relative to have a similar product line to fully experience it
3 Its for Bloggers Vloggers influencers
4 Innovation on hardware is slow

Agree"
Action button Androids have had these for like 12 years Lol
What How the heck did it take Apple so many years to switch to usbc Apple is always like 10 years behind its sick
i wanna play re4 remake here
Samee
It really sucks to be born in a middleclass family because you cant always get what you really want Having an iPhone feels like a dream come true But watching videos like this always makes me feel better 
Waiting for iPhone 16
So awesome to see Deestroying doing tech
so the best is buying iphone 14 pro max save ur money while getting flagship phone
Just a usb c
This obsession is mind blowing
they should have atleast given 90hz for 15 model
Lets be honest here the youtubersinfluencers are part of Apple marketing so of course they have to say the new device looks incredible
I like to upgrade my iPhone every two years I used to upgrade every year but the changes are so minimal hopping from pro max to pro max to where its not really worth the extra cost for a few gimmicky features I was doing fine without
ill ask lets see what theyll say 
Apple right is the company which let other companies invest in RD and when the technology is successfully implemented by others they just copy paste and thats their innovation at this point  They are earning some hard cash from iSheeps rn
This is ridiculous that the main feature which impressed and everybody talks about is USBC port Innovations which we deserved
I think that people that consider upgrading to the latest iPhone when they have the previous iPhone are either dumb compensating for something have the money to waste or a mixture of all three Its just so unnecessary since phones are way more durable than before and because the upgrade make insignificant changes
Iphones in 2023 
Apple are literally slowing technological progress
Who cant afford but also watching like me 
Can the after photo portrait edit mode work with live photo turnon too
Naahhh
"Two Headline features USB C  AND COSTLY  yes its a feature now 
Oppo user"
After always being an android girl Im getting one of these Thank you so much for sharing 
Ugly iphone 15 cheap material better xr or 14 pol
Apple marketing manager on YouTube
I have a iPhone 11 and thinking of upgrading this year earlier I was thinking of updating to iPhone 15 but seems like next years iPhone 16 might have the features from iPhone 15 proreally confused if I should buy the iPhone 15 or pro model as buying the pro seems to be a long time investment
As usual Your review is the only one I need Great job Honestly the weight seems like it would be the biggest advantage for me The 14 pro is heavy
Can anyone send me the link of wallpaper in the thumbnail
I saw the tiktok with u filming it
539 throwin shade bro
My LG from 7 years ago had a customizable quick action button USB C and fast charging Bravo to Apple for finally catching up
"Kool video But funny how apple  is saying with new titanium edges


Daaaaaaa thats not new That how all iphone s suppost to have Like the old one same metal edges But they went we the crappy plastic edges   Booo
The metal edges was the koolest thing on the iphones  That the orihinal"
Why Apple keep going with the phone What if Apple focus to make the camera
I dont understand the iPad Im commenting to this video from uses a USBC and has fast charging and all the other functionality that one expect from USBC Was the 4th generation iPad Air low key the greatest iPad they have ever produced
Really dude really if it would be android with that garbage of innovations or changes you would it be killing them and critize themthis is garbage only great innovation they did was that finally they can use USB PORT C  like really lol such a iphone lover that can critizes them the same way you go when is android doing so litllePixel has done way more and better and yet you kill them about their little innovation but is iphone
Great review as always  I wish Apple does a 35 macro lens for close up shots  Zoom in on Flowers food and insects
My 12 pro max works just like it this is a joke
Not really any reason to upgrade from 13 pro in my opinion
USBC ftw So tired of weak ass lightning pins
What wallpaper is that
Yawn
BOUGHT THE 15 PRO MAX LFG
M actually planning to switch from Android to iOS for the 1st time  thinking about getting 15 pro
I always thought titanium isnt stronger than steel Just lighter in weight
Another year another boring iPhone
I stay with my iPhone 14 pro max 
So Ive got a dilemma I took out a contract for the iPhone 14 pro max and I kinda hate it its way too big way too bulky even having tested it in store it felt different when Ive been using it on a day to day basis so my option is return it for a iPhone 14 Pro because I do love the dynamic island or for the iPhone 15 pro and Ive only got a few days to decide Any help would be much appreciated
Anyone have this wallpaper
Almost 38 dislikes on this video right now just coz Apple included USB C but kept the transfer speed at USB 2 only
lol same shit phone alwaysjust more money guys come and get it lol
I got my iPhone 11 so def upgrading to the iPhone 15 pro
But which no pro in pink 
Apple is still in 2010
"Im just going to go out there and say it I dont care they they didnt include fast charging Its well known that android batteries barely get through a year before the battery has noticeably degraded to the point youre having to charge multiple times per day or turn on energy saving mode iPhones typically last 2 years with normal usage until the same happens

Why moan about lack of fast charging when regular users will only be charging every day or two and will be doing so overnight Theres also the fact that Apple literally have a magsafe battery you can put on the back and just stick it in your pocket taking away the worry of finding a wall wart and cable

Idk fast charging just isnt an issue to me I do accept there are others who are different though like the people who go to work and spend their entire day not actually working but acting like a call center for microsoft tech support whos phones are dead before the day has even begun "
Ive already ordered the 15 Pro Max  Going from the 13 Pro Max base model to the 1 TB on the 15 Pro Max
This guy is an apple fan boy Biased
WHICH countries you think the cheaper country to buy iphone
I just want to but this iPhone 15 and never have to buy another one ever again
Huawei has returned but unfortunately only for the people living in the bright part of the world
I WISH WATERPROFF SO I CAN USE FOR SNORKELLING
My true issue with Apple isnt the lack of features in comparison to Samsung Its that the features Apple does have arent top of the line Like why doesnt Apple have the best screen fastest charing and better question of life features No one in this comment section can name a true difference between the iPhone 15 and the 12 or 13 Which is a huge issue Id be sold if they just gave us the best screen money can buy
Meanwhile I just want to be able to set my snooze to any time I wish vs 9 minutes have more than one timer and a frontfacing camera that doesnt autoadjust
"Ive discovered apples pattern

ONLY upgrade every 2 years or 3 if you can Never do it every year Its a waste of money for minuscule improvements 

I am upgrading from iPhone 10 to 15PRO I also have iPhone 12 Pro for my other work phone and iPhone 12 Pro Is the last iPhone that will take two sims one being the physical one

Last year I went to do iPhone 14Pro and realized the wastefulness

After 15PRO God wiling my next will be like 17 or 18  

Innovation truly died with Steve Jobs"
"The real question is when will we android users be able to send videos back and forth via text and it be full quality 

If we can just bridge that gap  we can live in unity and peace"
The blur effect  to convert normal photos to portrait is already available in samsung s23
Nah brah Gimme a flip or loose ur stock price guys
Nice 
Marques tries really hard to make a point theres more than usbc But hey lets be honest Its just a port change this year
Test
The iPhone 15 Ultra will probably have the thunderbolt speeds
almost 5 mins of talk about USBCgeez
Lets just be honest this is just as bad of an update as the 14 pro series was I wont be upgrading for another year  I cant believe people will leave the 13 pro series and iPhone 14 pro series to this crap
214 USBC charge your friends Android phone What We are Apple fanboys we dont have friends who use Android phones 
Why no iPad mini 7
607 you mention wishing they went all the way with thunderbolt speeds thats for the iphone 16 pro lol
12 million views Not knocking the hustle yet its a calculated subtle hype review for very little upgrade for another year Steve Jobs would be ashamed
Waste of time with the new iPhone 15
My action button gonna open clash of clans
Ahh yes the same thing but more money Buy up chumps
Why do people still buy Apple Lol
The iPhone 145 would be more fitting
Id say the best iphone to buy right now is the iphone 14 pro Its a big upgrade compared to the previous generation iphones and still performs amazingly  the iphone 15 lineup must be the most boring update yet Congrats Apple
Meh dont care about USB C really Sticking to my iphone 14 pro max not much to see here Feels more like an Iphone 14S upgrade than a 15
me and my iPhone 12 are good
Im in the camp of totally getting one It is time to upgrade my iPhone 12 Pro I have a 15 pro max in natural Ti coming
the lighter weight means if you drop it less force will spread to the glass increasing the odds that it will not break
Ehh nothing new with iPhone 15 They could have brought back the phone jack to make it more exciting
Its so groundbreaking that iphone now have things that have been out there for years
as an iPhone X user I will only upgrade for the usb C honestly nothing besides finally throwing lightning in the garbage and maybe a better screen is motivating me to upgrade its a shame there is no mini iPhones anymore though if the iPhone SE4 is coming next year with an iPhone X or mini size I will happily wait i really hate how we are forced to use bigger and heavier phones when there is no alternative except an even bigger phone
im getting the 15 pro max for a couple reasons my 12 pro max battery is shit my 12 has too many scratchesdifferent phone from my 12 pro max as its a workhigh school phone USBC Recording to EHD 5x zoom and overall its way newer and dynamic island
So basically the most minor improvements possible like usual
iphone again is getting android features that have been out for years and iphone enthusiasts are acting like its so new
I wanted to switch to Apple Iphone 15 but I rather continue using my Samsung S23 Ultra as there are no major updates from the 14 Congrats to apple for bringing 5 years USB Type C now
With my 12 Pro Max ill wait for iPhone 16  Its still good phone runs fast  smooth
If they put usb 3 in both phones there wouldnt be a reason to to make the pro they just like milking their brainwashed customers for more money
Its like madden same game every year just add the year to it lol 
150 It cant be more than a year unless Apple really wants to pay fines in the EU
I use my iPhone 14 Pro for certain Real Estate Photography gigs Generally if Im filming a small apartment or using my iPhone for Ariel footage on a boom pole So I have to say upgrading my phone is a necessity for the operations of my business however For Apple to release an iPhone that is so similar to the 14 Pro almost makes it not worth while The key features I was looking out for were 48 MP in the other lenses and not only in the main camera The quality drop from the different lenses is so apparent in post Even if they could resolve the 48 MP to save raw photos at a more efficient data rate so that it doesnt fill up the phone too quickly Its all good an nice to announce a 5x telephoto camera but if the sensor is still 12MP is the quality of that photo still worth it
Couldve saved yourself the trip and talked about it in your office
Im hoping ringer mode can be tied to a focus mode now that the mute switch is gone
I got a iPhone lightning port adapter from us c to lightning port why change
Im stickin with iPhone 14promax
Getting my iPhone 15 pro max Friday
Lol is that a camera bump on top of a camera bump
i still have a 6s plus i need to get a new phone the issues are getting worse I wish I didnt have to have 1 I am looking at it to see if i can force myself to finally buy a new 1
Honestlycamp dont care
Thanks for the vid
EU usb type c ruling
Mediocre phone
340 this this the Nokia Lumias from 10 years ago already had it LMAO
one piece
i got an used 150 phone and even came with 90Hz screen refresh ratio
Jeepers they look just the same as last years and the years before
Here I am watching yet another iPhone review on my iPhone 8 The pain 
Thanks for this review on the iPhone 15 USBC is a big deal and one of the main factors for whether or not Id switch Lack of fast charging is a bizzare choice by Apple Might be worth it if Google doesnt slow down with their surveillanceadtech shenanigans
We know you have been using these devices for a week now
Iphone could wrap up a turd and people would buy it
Good to see you but these are not really worth your time there are plenty much products to look into
The best review ever
Trash Not worth price but android phones dont have good accurate color for video recording Also whiten skin
Everyone just overlooks the AV1 hardware decoder and what it signals about the future of video streaming
626 the trillionaire is milking you to last drop baby
What does the soft corner radii at 104 mean
Any chance Ankers new lineup for IPhone 15 is the same set of products for Android phones lol
220 oh god imagine talking about android phone came out with this port as something new in 2023 
Ive got the 12 pro max and dont really need a new phone but I need to switch my phone carrier and was wondering if it would be worth it to get the new iPhone when I switch because they might have a if you switch now get the new iphone deal or whatever But Im on the fence about it
Crazy how Marques gives his take on the new iphone where as didnt even talk about Huaweis new 5G phone  or did i miss something Either way hope hes still unbiased on all his reviews
Trust in Jesus for everything 
I am forever heartbroken they discontinued the green colourway I personally think it looks so much classier than the blue which basically looks the same as the black I still cannot give up my iPhone 11 Pro Max because I love the green too much
I guess I understand why tech reviewers pretty much only compare the new model to the previous model but for the VAST majority of consumers that comparison is totally irrelevant Why Because only a small percentage upgrade every year Most people considering these phones will be coming from an iPhone 12 or older and from that perspective this is a massive upgrade And all comparisons aside they are outstanding devices  the best total package hardware software ecosystem you can buy
Did you have to say your friends android phone  lol
Im planning on getting an iPhone 15 plus because my samsung s21 dies so fast and doesnt charge properly regardless of what cable i use But the cable change and the fact that i always talked bad about IPhone but never had one is why im planning on getting one
androidsisters i dont feel so good
Great review as always But interestingly you didnt talk about the battery
As I always do I get one I wait 2 or 3 phones later then upgrade otherwise I dont see the real changesupdatesnew features
love how iphone keeps downgrading
why future proof a phone they will slow down in 2 years
"Im in the camp in italy we pay like 146364 dollars for a 15 pro 256gigs and thats a little bit unfair
By the way I think Ill keep my iPhone 14 pro for now even if Apple did a really good job on that 3nm CPU
Impressive"
You didnt talk about battery because 14 pro had some battery problems
Ugh  skipping the upgrade this year Thanks for your honest review I only trust you when it comes to new tech reviews
No USBC does not allow me to charge all my devices with one cable because right now I can charge my iPhone my wifes iPhone our iPad and our Airpods with one lightning cable but if I purchase the iPhone 15 it will be the only device that uses USBC Until we upgrade ALL our Apple devices we will not have a universal connector
wow Apple just bowed the the norm with USB C
As much dad I DESPISE losing my curved display because it absolutely sucks I am still stoked to get the 24 ultra Cant wait 89 mos in and Im ready itching for a new one Praying the WiFi antennas and networking is vastly improved Am jacked for the new processor Hope it blows everything else away
usbc with 2009 data tranfer speeds gotta love apple not even thunderbolt TWO speeds i mean who even cares no one is transferrign data off their phone air drop is 8Gbps apple only did this because the unelected European world government threatened to ban them iphone will be portless by 2026 anyway
Can the action button only have 1 function at a time or multiple  As in double press for one a hold for another a quick press for another 
As I am not an influencer I still have no reason to upgrade from my iPhone 11 Waiting for the iPhone fold to come out 90 of their upgrades should just be regular software updates
Is he staying at apple hq
I have a google pixle 4a and i like looking at videos of phones that i like
12 million views in 6 days that is insane power Apple cant ignore
We know its cause the EU demanded usb c  kinda communism BS which is probably why the first phone apple didnt want to add a ton and they watch moron politicians claim it was their insight that gave you a better phone
no fast charge tragic
iPhone 15 normal or Galaxy z flip 5
Definitely not worth it 
This is dumb I think more people going to switch to z flip and stuff very soon
"The very reason why I started watching Test cricket for two reasons The Ashes and Virat Kohli 
Virat was the one who changed the perception of how Test Cricket was perceived in our country He is the player that we needed to increase the stature of Test Cricket all over the world and he has done what no captain was able to do ie standing in the face of the opposition and giving it back"
I just recently switched from a Pixel 7 to a 14 Pro mainly for work and I cant tell you how many times I was toldrecommended to wait for the 15 models Truth be told I really like the 14 Pro and just wanted something with a 120hz display allday battery wireless charging and a reliable modem I was also able to get a great deal with a 700 trade in credit thanks to a promo which wouldnt have been the case had I waited Now Ill start off by saying Im not necessarily partial to android or iOS in fact Ive jumped back  forth between the two over the years Mainly to experience the pros of both but also to keep myself familiarized with the current state of the two That being said Im genuinely surprised that iOS 1651 the version my 14 Pro had out of the box  I am still currently using is more customizable than Android 13 or 14 for that matter At least in terms of the lock screentotal widget support Its been a while since Ive used iOS the XR was my last iPhone but Ive gotta admit that Im fairly impressed with how much control Apple has finally given the end user when it comes to the UI Of course Android still has the wallpaperbased color schemes that can be implemented system wide although there were times that I had issues getting the correct color combo to apply with my Pixel 7 Anyway aesthetics aside the 14 Pro has been an upgrade in quite a few ways namely the screen  biometrics The wireless modem was honestly one of the biggest factors for me for whatever reason my Pixel 7 just had terrible reception often whereas the 14 Pro has yet to have a single issue in all of the same areas I frequent It also hardly ever gets warm outside of fast charging even despite the fact that I live in the southern US TX Which leads me to another point Pixels are revered to have some of the best cameras a smartphone can have This is not an exaggeration the hardware  software combo implemented by Google is indeed impressive However this is only true for still imagesphotographs With video recording its a bit of a mess Im not a pro photographer by any means but I do enjoy capturing special moments mostly involving my kids or friends  family And when I was recording a school event my daughter was involved in the Pixel 7 stopped abruptly after 20 min due to getting too hot and this was just at 1080p60fps While yes I do live in a region with a reputation for being overly hot most of the year this was back  in early Spring  I was also indoors Ive never had another smartphone EVER cease video recording due to something like that Needless to say it was really disappointing The biometrics were also verysloppy The inscreen fingerprint reader was hit or miss basically all the time especially if my thumb was too dry or too wetmoist The face unlock had about the same success rate So more often than not I had to resort to drawing my pattern unlock to get past the lock screen Not the worst thing ever but certainly a mild inconvenience for a phone thats supposed to be a flagship or at the very least is priced like one Aside from those qualms though it wasnt what Id call a terrible experience Google just needs to step up their game some more They did great with bringing a true premium feel to the Pixel line with the redesign of the 6  6 Pro But the actual experience is still lacking and one could argue that its possibly just growing pains from switching to a newcustom SoC though I digress The Pixel is more suitable for those who prefer to tinker and tweak their phone in whatever ways they want or favor versatility while iPhones are arguably more refined and just work in all the ways you need a smartphone to  on the spot without any issues You sacrifice a bit of freedom but in exchange you have more reliability overall and dont have to worry about running into problems when it comes to whats important to you whether that be photography communication etc I guess thats why Ive never had a preference for either android or iOS to me smartphones are just tools that are intended to make life easier or just help you get certain things done The last thing Ill say is that I do hope Google improves the nonPro Pixels moving forward the base model should at the very least offer more as to set it apart from the A series which was hardly the case with the 7  7a for most people they might as well be the same phone Perhaps Ill revisit the Pixel when the 9 or 10 series comes out hopefully by then they will truly be the iPhone of the android world
The question is are they going to stop selling lightning cables for the older models as its ok if your iphone has MagSafe but unfortunate if it doesnt
Boring update as expected No breakthrough innovation
How do you move towards the USBC port and not have fast charging
I get the whole thing behind a newer and nicer iPhone But it just seems like its almost the same phone with something slightly different every year I wish they would have a whole new different phone than a phone with just one or two upgrades It doesnt make sense to me I still have a 12 Pro Max and Im okay with it I just wish they would take the time to make a crazy switch up on it and not just trying to release something every year in the same year or whatever
the change to titanium is just to make it lighter
Honesty its not worth it  Noting major has changed That fact the fast charging was removed is a step in the opposite direction
Thinking of upgrading from the 13 to a 15pro or 15 pro max but idk which one of the 2 to select Any recommendations
Nothing about SIM capabilities
Saving fast charging for next year
Why is faster charging a problem Ive had the IPhone 14 pro max since launch and Ive only ever need to charge it once a day which is when Im asleep and it has smart technology to avoid draining and recharging the battery and it be at max charge when you need it Besides you can go 2 days of using this phone a lot before it dies
where that blue jacket hoodie during the flight come from tho
all in allwhat hes trying to say isstick with the best phone the samsung s23 ultra because  iphone just does the same thing over and over  while price gouging your wallet
You know why they didnt do fast charging its so they can release it next year
I would like to see a iPhone mini again
Unfortunately Apple just didnt show me enough to upgrade 
Cant wait for Iphones to start detecting Android USB C cables and refusing to charge lol s
Thank you EU for Universal Charging Standard
saw you with the RED camera magic
would it charge faster with a thunderbolt cable tho have a gift card and might as well enjoy the USB c 3
"I waited several years to buy any iPhone Pro Im still waiting heh
In my country Poland there are no installments only the entire cost of the iPhone 15 pro 128 GB
999 USD USA vs 1200 Euro Deutschland vs 1300 Euro Poland
USA From 999 or 4162 per month for 24 months Note
Deutschland Ab 4995Monat from 1199
Poland 1300 Euro
Now you know why people dont buy phones"
Its another garbage its more of the same just a camera for 1500 dollars Apple is crazy
Nextgeneration portrait  Xiaomi had this for some time and they gave it in an update you dont have to go nuts and buy a new phone for that
they just increased the radiation on this mircowave
the problem i have with usb c is that the port is god damn difficult to clean once dirty the lightning port how ever super easy to clean
I dont know anyone who plugs their iPhone into a computer nowadays unless its to just charge it or to do a backup
What is the charging wattage of the iphone 15 pro
Seems really wasteful to fly to NorCal just to review this phone  After Apple touting all this environmental changes they could have sent it to you
All I heard was a new charging port
Stay humble stay hungry as always
With the new phone and the new button will the iPhone 15 still have custom back button on the  logo
Im considering making the switch from my s22 Ultra to this Ive never owned an iPhone but Ive been intrigued by them over the last few years and now that my mother and sister have switched to them Ive become even more curious More research will have to be done first of course Thanks for the video 
My Question Marques is what the point of being able to transfer so quick last I remember I cant use my iphone like an external drive like I could with my android Has that changed with the new USBC
Been waiting for years for USBC So ridiculous its taken this long Broke down and got an iPhone 13 Pro a few years ago
I totally expected this from Apple The next iPhone will have fast charging Then the iPhone after that will have slow USB 30 They will upgrade the speeds slowly and act like they are making huge breakthroughs
It looks the same
Apple got lazy and are being exposed for being just a brand They will fall off Im happy with my Fairphone and feel good about having bought one Apple isnt all that special anymore
I think apple is going BlackBerry way
The big thing is it is usb c  Let me say this  BOOOORING
Ofcource they dont support fast charging yet They need to have something to improve on next years iPhone 16 
USBC and no faster data speeds What a joke Apple
is the 15 screen on 60hz
"Probably the worst iPhone to date the only new thing is literally a irrelevant action button the rest is just the usual yearly cycle updates better camera latest chipset woow big whoop NOT 

I had a 4 4S 6 6S  held on to that for as long as i could now got a SE 2nd Gen ive really hated the notch fad since day 0 its not a full screen  until they literally make a full screen with the fingerprint under the screen  put the cameras under the screen like the ZTE Axon Ultra 40  im a Apple fan but they Along with Samsung need to pull their fingers out there backsides  actually advance their phones like most of the Android lot whether its the ZTE Axon Ultra 40 full screen some mad RGB colour cooling phone like the Redmagic 7 PRO 

 for Apple not putting the fastest USBC only on the PRO is dirty as hell from them already created a division on day 1 of USBC iPhones 

But hey at least Apples chipset is totally nuts every year  out preforms every other chip out there i recently moved from PC to Mac Mini M2 Pro 16GB RAM 1TB Storage  the difference is insane my little Mac Mini with its tiny chip is literally way more powerful than my tank box pc with a thousand fans made me realise how inefficient Windows  PC is now"
love your video
I m still happy with my Iphone 12
Say thank you EU for usb C 
Remember when this dude said Boosted Rev was the Tesla of Scooters Flop Flop Flop Bankrupted the company
Well EU signed paper that soon every phone have to have easly replaceble battery so no reason to buy this phone now at all
I broke my iPhoneXr the other day and went to Verizon to get it fixed Walked out with the phone still broken and an order confirmation for the 15 lol
sounds mid
I want in screen finger scanner I still dont like face unlock
Is it just me who gets annoyed by the diagonal design camera lenses on the iPhone 15 I know its that way to make it better but it looks so odd
I said that I phones look more and more like android phones over years
Should i buy iphone 14 pro or iphone 15 cause its my first time buying an iPhone and i cant seem to find much difference
apple fanboys getting scammed out of their mind this is what I call a brain wash
USB c has been on android for a while  iPhone 15 looks like the 14
"That USBc looks cheap AF 
Im clinging onto my Lightning iPhone 14 Pro Its collectible now"
what do you think about france saying the iphone 12 is giving off too much radiation I call bs since its non ionizing but Im still a tiny bit concerned since I have an iphone 12 haha thinking about upgrading to the 15 just incase
"I dont know why Apple people consider the whole world to be idiots There are some people who take it just to show it to others I upgraded from XS Max to 11 Pro Max Since then I have been waiting for a completely new look change
They have only one job Fooling the public every year I want someone to give them a fair fight And the public should invest only on what is worth buying "
Soif you change the function of the action button to lets say the flashlight how do you muteunmute the phone
Im normally a dont care but I need a better phone camera for YT videos For now I dont think the 15 Pro Max has enough benefit esp if the upload speed is still slow Ill stick to Android for now Maybe Ill look at the latest iPad for my digital design work Thanks for the dets and fair review
48 MP chip What
Haha no super fast charging Wow Apple dropped the ball there
If they dont add a manual focus wheel with a pro photo mode like adroid im gonna lose my mind The amount of times my 14 pro has been struggling to focus through a window is borderline criminal all while my old galaxy s8 had an option to manually adjust focus
fast charging destroys batteries so maybe a good balance
Good review as always so thanks for posting I dont know this years update seems rather boring to me Also Im not overly enthusiastic with the continued buildup of new features that makes iOS a bit convoluted That last ad from Apple about carbon neutral was the most corny promotional video I have ever seen While Im pretty much married to iOS I think Im going hold off and see how the Pixel 8 Pro and S24 Ultra pans out 
Damnnnnn over 12 millions views in less than a week sheeeshhh marquees you are the best at it
I see Mr Brownlee flies first class 
dont forget apple changed the macbook from magsafe to usbc and then back to magsafe  I am so happy to be back on magsafe I usually charge my phone wirelessly
They really do make it easy to pass on the yearly upgrade 14 will do just fine for another 365 days
One cable to rule them all
Might want to check your captions These are for the new video not the current one Unless my YouTube is glitching
Thank you apple   i dont want to upgrade my 12 pro  i phone this time also
Amazing video good job
If something only works with other apple products then that is a bad thing
All I wish for IPhones is to have messenger chathead
Idc what theyve done with this phone in secret or behind the curtains  this years iphone aint it Idc how many times it sells out Theyre just like Jordana at this point so
I will never get used to the term rails when referring to the frame of the phone
I dont know if I am a rare breed but I love both Apple and Samsung and I go back and fourth basically whoever has what I want at the time I am 53 so dont care about status of any kind as the Apple products are beautiful and always scream rich looking to me but my Samsung does things that my iPhone cant begin to do  Sadly But half my fam is on Samsung android and  my daughter is on Apple so of course messaging my daughter is great and as shes going to have a child soon I love FaceTime in the messages I love everything about iMessages but when Im on a Samsung phone I can do kind of the same thing with other people that are on Samsung the only time I feel like Im missing out is when I am corresponding with my daughter who has an iPhone  Now I am debating after having an iPhone 13 for a couple years now and because of its brightness is sound nothing is that great to me As a matter fact I think its one of the worst Apple phones ever that I have used iPhone I should say sorry Apple fans it did bare minimum of anything that I wanted it to do I knew that going in I thought as Im older it wont make too much of a difference boy was I wrong 120 Hz was missed especially coming from android but again that is not why I really mess with that iPhone its because iMessages as I said before Texting does seem to be a bit more polished than an android well Samsung is the only one I can speak for personally and yes I have downloaded the Gboard app of course with that all being said Im not locked into either Eco system as I do not have a computer I have a tablet from Samsung I have an iPad from Apple I like them both equally I mainly use them for writing notes and watching content I find myself bored with an iPhone where is with android Samsung I can do almost anything I want if I dig deep enough and learn how customization is still important because it gives me what I want if Im gonna pay for something and a lot of money I want it to do what I want it to do not what it thinks I should do Im one of those that like to tinker and dig but I would never consider myself a techie just someone who likes to have fun with it but now Im stuck between with a grandbaby coming do I just keep my iPad so I can still do FaceTime and then get an android phone so that I can Write my notes where Im at when I need them the most with the ultra that has a pen included or do I stick with iPhone new to FaceTime in iMessages all the time Perhaps Ive gotten myself into a pickle half my family hates Apple the other half hates Samsung I will never understand as long as I live why somebody would be loyal to a brand that does not pay you to be loyal to them Ive never been that way about anything myself Pay for what I like what I enjoy at that time I dont care whos name is on it and so Im not the one to be in the war I think both offer wonderful things and of course they dont offer the same exact things then they wouldnt have competition I think what truly keeps iPhone alive for most is iMessages And because of that they can go as high as they want and people will pay for that convenience that polished Ness and it is absolutely fantastic Without a doubt other than that I do not like being in the fenced garden I have a mind of my own and love to get out and do what I want where I want with who I want with what I want that anytime I want I get it better security if you cant do as much or goes far or choose what you wanna do and I can embrace that and appreciate that but there are other things that I can get to protect me an android so that is not a game changer by any means Hell of a 12 year old or perhaps it was a 13 year old can get into Apples system and hack it How secure is it truly in my heart and so I would say about as much as anything else truly anything can be hacked any system Chan crash Do you teches out there Have any ideas what I can do or what I should do as Im curious to your thoughts as As they may help me along the  process I believe I can use FaceTime on WiFi from any of my Apple products to keep in touch with my daughter and my grandbaby to be and still enjoy the android as my phone I think we can even do FaceTime from android now as long as somebody from iPhone sends the link Im sure its probably not as good but hopefully doable anybody out there doing that as well if so tell me how thats working out I love to take pictures but Im not a photographer and this whole slow shutter button on android is a real bummer so I am waiting for the S 24 ultra and hoping it has been upgraded in that area before I make a final decision Im glad that iPhone is brighter Now as I am older things are becoming harder to see harder to hear And so on and so forth theyre both so great it is so hard my iPhone 13 is the first time I got a nonflagship phone from Apple I just could never do that again although most things didnt bother me about it the few things that it didnt have bothered me the most perhaps I shouldve gone with the promax as I wanted to but Im having wrist issues to hold something extremely heavy now thats gone away for the most part It is no longer an issue for those of you that love both I know Im not alone help help help lol Im never a hater towards any brand I was even looking into the new Google pixel as I love the voice dictation it is on point for sure and thats important for somebody like me whos getting older who wants to use notes or record somebody or whatever it may be even talk out a text or all these phones seem to offer some thing that something else doesnt I guess thats what keeps them all in business now its time I start looking for a computer and this is where Im deciding What ecosystem do I want to be in for that kind of changes the game it kind of keeps me locked in which I hate but you got to take the bad with a great
Somehow I have the feeling that technology is progressing a little something similar to music only old songs are being reworked We all use technology and see but remember your childhood we 40 years old Cars were supposed to fly peace in the world nature and technology in harmony by now Considering the amount of advertisements on all smartphone devices they should be completely free
So fragile product if you drop bye bye why not a carbon fiber frame and carbon fiber glass or like a bullet proof glass

"Thx for the review
Confirms what I thought
Apple is really taking their customers for a bunch o fools
Nothing new just meaningless updates Not even updating their chip to take advantage of usbc capacity across the line
This is beyond useless"
Got 14 Pro last year planning on having that last at least 34 more years
I think its funny how Apple is just trying to relieve responsibility for the environment by jointly developing a technology that already existed before so they can claim that they are closer to being carbon neutral but in reality its still not sustainable enough to be 100 carbon neutral
this is honestly sad
"That would have been funny if they released 3 different iPhone 15s
The base model at normal price the 15 pro at normal price and then a third option which is just the iPhone 15 base model but it has USB c instead and it even more expensive than a pro"
The reason why they change it to USB C is because EU had posted a final statement that all mobile devices have to use USB C since that is the future   if they dont change it they are unable to sell it in any country in the EU 
niceeee
changing from regular to portrait was already on the pixel
I takes sense for them to get rid of the 128gb pro max when you think about it A blog site posted the highest quality photo takes up 75mb Youll blow through that in no time if you take a lot of photos listen to a lot of music etc I have a 512gb iPhone 12 Pro Max and I bought the 15pro max 51gb Ive used 50of my 512gb maybe 60
Ive still got my 12 pro max debating if I need an upgrade hmmmmm
i preordered the iPhone pro max 256 gb when it opened and was still pushed back to Oct 2 for delivery
I liked lightning ports better than usb c That little tongue inside usb c can fail lightning has no parts to break
fix your captions its from a galaxy vid
Get lost apple fan boy Still spitting that these old features are mind blowingAt this point apple is just mocking customers
How much apple pay u apple fan boy
Close Caption not aligning with whats being said
i have some trouble with subtitles mi the only one 
Theres no fast charging for the USBC because theyre saving that for the iPhone 16 Maybe the 17 Of course Apple knows this already because they know people will just buy it then It would be a new feature for their product later down the line but they couldve just gone ahead and do it with the 15
I am getting 15 pro max I have been using the phone for years now and love camera capabilities as well as apple ecosystem I use mac mini ipad pro and apple watch so everything is working together well I have tried samsung in the past but I kept going back to iphone Simply because of the ecosystem Features on the new 15 pro max are intriguing Looking forward to trying new camera I am an artist and using photo reference is a must and most days I do not have my DSLR camera with me
like anybody will buy a pro model at less than 1tb  which makes the pricing just a tottal bs
Same phone
Marques subtitles for this video are wrong
Would you upgrade from the 13 Pro Max to the 15 Pro Max or wait for future releases
BORRRINGGGG where is the iphone flip 
type C looks like it engineered with lighting cable as its base and talking about fast charging apple have been capable of playing around different charge speeds with their own cables and nothing changeshonestly im not really buying the typec hype on iphone There must be a catch if the government is partaking in forcing apple to change their stuffs must b the same thing they keep chasing after peoples personal business that does not concern jobless people who do politics
Next generation portrait Mode  that thing was in midrange android phones 3 years ago
Closed captions seem to be for a different video
fast charging at over 50 wattscoming in 2030
It honestly doesnt even matter what new features it has i just trade in my current iPhone for the new iPhone and barely pay anything for it since my carrier always has a new deal for new iphones

The action button customisation interface looked like a new gen game haha

Pretty sure its just USB C
At this point the new iPhones are just cash grabs every year they make tiny little changes that dont even matter and people fall for it idgi
Shameful to be shipping such expensive phone with very antiquated technology
Funny enough if it wasnt for a law then iphone wouldnt have changed
I definitely am thinking about getting it and this vid convinced me just a little bit more
I have a 12 right now so thinking to get a 14 or 15
Hi You added the wrong subtitles in English please correct it thanks
Who cares its obsolete in less than a year Just more regurgitated crap from a company who touts caring about the environment while simultaneously perpetuating a throwaway culture
Same as usual right 
Its not worth an upgrade for most people in my opinion as apple highlights features that android users have had for years and take for granted and also android had had an action button for years using the power button and the same for the galaxy watch has the finger gestures also inside accessibility settings
Where can I get the wallpaper in the thumbnail
is the subtitle wrong like its for other videos im sorry since Im not native i think i need some helps from subtitle but i guess Ill rely on auto sub this time
Anyone knows the name or where to find the wallpaper that is set on the thumbnail
Basically same crap
Same phone as the iPhone 11 12 13  14 such a let down
The video has completely wrong subtitles I guess you picked the wrong file to upload
So now we need android chargers
Currently using the 12pm and once again no upgrade necessary still going to use it until it looses support or if theres a WOW big changes in future models but at this rhythm its slow similar and minimum changes
Same BS every year ith Apple Iphone for the unfortunate people who have had an phone and had to do all the BS updates and everntuall y your phone is become use less so you have to upgrade
They should have just got rid of the charging port completely Weve had magnetic charging for a while now I know its used for data transfers but surely Apple can help with that somehow
wtf is wrong with the subtitles
So basically nothing new
Why you wearing the autotrader logo on your shirt
not waiting for iphone so not interested in
It seems like unless you are a professional photographer it doesnt make sense to upgrade Thanks for the video
My thoughts for apples new 15 line up   n yeah im always honest with my reviews
"Im not an Apple iPhone guy  My personal phone is a Samsung  

I do use a company phone that is an Apple iPhone  It is nice to see that theyre finally going to a USB C connector"
all I know is when apple does something new it is all going to be done properly and thats because as we know they never ever take risks but when they change they make it the best they can make it
wow  most boring iphone release ever
So they were forced to change their cable by EU policy but decided to make use of 2009 technology and got a button that has been on Android since 2015  bUt BuT tHeY dId iT tHe aPpLe wAyNice
Honestly my opinion about the usb c is that Europe start that protest against the fact that Apple doesnt send the cable on the box
Me watching this while thinking having no chance of getting one 
I still use the wired headphones but as far as I know there is no usbc on the headphones
Apple is trash 
Wow A button on the side that you can program to open an app on the phone seriously
Anyone a bit tired to hear apple claim a bunch of BS misleading stuff in order to make you feel excited about the product
SO BLACK WOW
I wonder how much problems usb C os going to have  theres dust going in the lightning port already wich makes it not want to charge If this happens to usb C to i wonder how it is going to to

Since this is going to be my first Iphone looks like a good upgrade
"I like the action button but they shouldnt have gotten rid of the lock switch
Such tactile functionality"
Fast charging might be a new feature they are keeping for 2024 or 2025 
I wonder how Apple manages to fool people every year with their new iPhones They are basically the same phone with a different number and a higher price tag Maybe they have some secret magic spell that makes everyone want to buy them Or maybe they just hypnotize them with their fancy ads and sleek designs Whatever it is its working Lol
"Ive bitten the bullet Time for me to upgrade from the iPhone 6s Hope this iPhone 15 lasts me another 8 years

 Wonder what Ill enjoy the most from a modern phone  Lack of bezel Overall speed"
Will be waiting for the IPhone 16proMax no major upgrade this Year
1 minute 40 seconds in realized I waste too much time watching a video about a phone I have no intention of buying and is pretty much that same phone as the one 45 years ago with a different port Not gonna waste my time on apple related videos  maybe the new MacBooks will give us something more

Thank you EU for this Upgrade
"Love the potentially lighter 15 Pro Max due to the titanium frame Pro Max models since the 12 have been quite hefty especially in the pocket 

Not sure how much I care about the 5x optical zoom Would like to eventually at least have a model with a 48MP sensor since I dont right now But no rush right now since I havent been taking very many photosvideos the past few years overall 

Definitely want a 67 model but would rather splurge on the 15 Pro Max than the 15 Plus since the Plus is still expensive especially if you get a higher storage and its missing a lot of benefits of the Pro Max which isnt really the much more   Theyre both over 1000 in the end lol  

I just feel like I should go for the Pro Max I def cant do smaller size anymore Too used to having a 67 and watch a lot of video and play games Sooo The A17 Pro chip also kicks it up a notch for mobile gaming Which I think is nice 

All that said Im not upgrading yet But maybe early next year No rush 

Besides Ive friends who preordered the 15 Pro Max and shipping is already pushing to the end of November for some About 2 months

So I probably couldnt even get one now until Xmas lol "
"all of us know thats apple given money for these kind of video  apple what kind of smart phone do you really make  a titanium cover 2023  really  nokia had made it in 2002 by nokia 8910  
a type c called usb3  what the hell man  china had made first phone called LE1 in 2013 with type c  come on people  15 pro max the same 14 same 13 same 12 even same 11 pro max  at less give me a battary 5000mh  fast charge with 65 W "
Im honestly genuinely disappointed in the iPhone this year I thought they was going to have a phone that was a REAL competition for the s23 ultra Truly disappointed in apple this year
Iphone 13 is better
Anyone else noticing the closed caption is completely off Like its for another video
Is it still a satellite phone
On the website it says there is fast charging 
So its basically the same iPhone as the 14 and 13 iPhones are boring
am i the only one or why is the picture not crispy 1080p
Thank you EU regulations for forcing Apple to switch to USBC
"At this point they basically sell the same phone and fanboys will just keep buying
But I got to say for me the biggest surprise was that theres not a price increase

Also of course they will not want you to fast charge that already shitty battery Marques"
Yup i never had a need to download files from a phone through a cable in 10 years Its irrelevant for most people i believe
I have a 14 Pro Max Its indeed just a USBC change to me
I feel like iPhone15 is way behind what Samsung has offered in 2018 with their Note9 Note9 still has more features than this new iPhone15
Its totally time to hop on that Samsung S23 Ultra train yall No fingerprints hello 120 Hz display and a way cheaper price tag  no more splurging on Apples Titan Later Apple 
899  why so cheap the pro max is 1866 dollar here

If you have an iPhone 14 pro as a content creator is it advisable to get the 15pro
Is the flashlight still the adaptive flashlight
Samsung has that blur effect from last 2 years Innovation 
Now apple not think about new  innovation they only think marketing
The captions are not in sync with your spoken words Is there a way to rectify that Thanks
I just dont see enough value in the 15 Pro to make an upgrade out of my usual trade iun window cycle worth it I can wait for the 16 and see what features Apple incorporates based on the 15 leaks that it is stealing for ideas
iPhone are still lagging behind the MATE 60 
where can i get that hills wallpaper
"One thing that was missed from this review is that the Pro has the alwayson display and the basic model does not

It was this feature which tipped the decision for me"
Please review your RED video cam The one youre using in this video
Samsung is better
I am Also still not a fan of the snub of the Physical SIM slot not every ESIM provider have a slimless ESIM setup as the US So how did other countries get this version and why
Im on my iPhone 7 still for 8 years and have been thinking about a new phone I really like that the 15 offers 1tb storage but hate the charger change I have so many lighting cords XD 
Nothing changed technically everything is same only priced increased
The charging issue on iPhones is frustrating How does the iPhone 15 Pro Max compare to the Mate 60 Pro
Well from what I hear USBC was a mandatory change because of EURegulations that say that every phone on the market must have an USBC port Apple not wanting to have to make two different versions for the US and EUMarket they reluctantly gave in and killed lightning So I guess they are aware that this is no real innovation
He is trying so hard not to say that its the same than last year 
Ngl Ive had my 11 pro since it was released and I still dont see a solid reason to upgrade yet literally looks the same and the only noticable difference is the dynamic island and the new port might have to wait til the 16 or 17 comes before I call it quits
The reason they put a new USBC controller in the Pro is so that the EU could not require them to offer full USBc 10Gb speeds in their nonpro models This way they can say it is not possible since the nonpro models dont have the new USBC controller chip Thanks Apple
Ah its the same phone again Nice
iPhone is soon lame with no more innovation
Display refresh ratio on regular iPhone is
Think Ill just stick to my 14 pro for a while until a big update happens to the iphone Just aint worth it
Not interested to buy Thankyou for the review 
why is no1 talking about the inconsistancy in product spec for the zoom in iphone 15 pro  on the apple page where they compare the different iphone 15 models it says up to 10x optical zoom but everywhere else it says 5x optical zoom MKHD Marques
Eh Ill keep my iPhone 13
yawn
I got the 11 so i really wanted to buy this But the normal 15 seems pretty boring 14 pro would almost make more sense The pro is nice with the thinner bezels titanium and usb c but i wished that there were a little more features that would justify buying it for over 1000 buck ls IN COMBINATION WITH A PLAN I dont even wanna know how expensive they are here in europe when you buy em without a plan
Getting it as I am a XS Max users My order is being weird though so if that fails I may wait a year
still rocking my iphone 12 and happy
Im sure Marques wasnt paid by apple
looks like an apple ad
Did they also bring over the satellite calling feature 
The most basic crap
Nothing above the 13 is worth it and tbh I have the 5se for work and its never given me problems in over 6 years my 13 gave me problems already
Wow  USBC So futuristic How did apple think of this new feature 
The subtitles are off
As Samsung  user do not understand why they give iPhone UsbC coz for me iPhone charger socket  and cable is way much betteri have 5x charging cables UsbC prices between 520 quidand some of them just get loose when u move wit phone so most of time using wireless charger
You mistakenly uploaded the wrong subtitle 
Hurry Tesla I cant wait to leave Apple
fast charging will be for iphone 16 they like minial increments on iphone but we still buy it 
Iphone has reach its max  potential  theres is no more feature they can add from iphone 12 till this current release people are just being delusional 
People are still buying iPhones WHY
"Did you know that your subtitles of this video are the subtitles of your other video IPhone 15 event reactions sneaky updates

Just so you know "
Long story short better camera 1200 iPhone 16  17 18 better camera 1500
Im always having bad luck with iPhones I got the 4 comes the 4s Then I got the 6 came the 6s Then I got the 8 came the X And now that I got the 14Pro they do the jump faster than I thought I also got the watch 8 and the AirPods Pro 3  this is just painful
Hmmm I think finally I can change my 11 pro to the 15 pro max
Let me save you 13 minutes its mostly USB C
Whats up with your subtitles Im I the slowest because Im just noticing this
You are like an iphone lover to be honest there is nothing new with this phone that makes it better than iphone 14 even they compare this iphone with iphone 12 not iphone 14 honestly it is so over rated that phone
"As usual they invented something world schocking
This year its a five time zoom lens"
I will start saving for 14 pro by November 2024 I shall buy it
Is the white actually white or silver  
What is cheap iPad 
Its good but not PAR with Samsung S series please give honest review sometimes We definitely sell kidney for the new iPhone which is way beyond Samsung S in terms of technology
As for me Im still up in the air if I should upgrade Im on 12pro max which the last 2 looks like my phone currently
The reason they changed the ports is because of the Judgement my the EU on wanting universal charging cables as you stated that all of new products are using USBC
Can we just stop pretending that this is even remotely different 
Fast charging would be added in 16 and they would add minor features mark my words
Very good 
Youre wrong on the 20 watt charging Its 27 watt
Iphone is trash my 23 ultra slaughters the 15 Apple is good and marketing to the zombies that dont know st about technology
I wish there was only 2 new phones not 4 each time
So the new button is the tap function where you can tap the back
I upgraded to the iPhone 15 pro max from my IPHONE 7 And yes we still exist but not for long
Gak sanggup beli iPhone 15 msih stay di iPhone  14
Wow Usbc  same looking iphone new camera 
Do they actually give you a charger now
Currently using 11 I waited for the 15 to upgrade after 4yrs But I think Im gonna wait for the 16 lol
Currently running a 12 Pro Max and I guess its time for an update
None of the colors on 15pros that I wanna choose this time no new designs just give us back the gold and rose gold please
154 He called it cheap  apple wont take that lightly
"Why are you making the side button sound like new invention

I dont have anything to buy iphone 
So I have 14 pro max should I get the 15 pro max
Im still rocking with my 12 Pro Max still going strong no issues at all
Still no high refresh rate
Still the same
Its great for me it might not be good for someone who has an iPhone 14 somebody that has a 12 promax that has essentially waited three years This is great and I will be getting one
APPLE TOOK AN LOSS ON THE CABLE LOL
35mm default is a very nice feature
Maybe this has been noted already but the captions are waaaaay off
Going to hold onto my 13 pro max for another year No issue with the release Just didnt wow me and my 13 pro max is still great Reduce e waste a bit  Cant wait for the s24 ultra release to see if that will be my next android phone
People in Asia using huawei mate60 to hammer multiple nails into wood block SCREEN side Can the new iphone 1515 pro TITANIUM BODY do the exactly same It is TITANIUM correct Would be great if it does
ill wait until next year yearly upgrades arent what they used to be
The iphone15 is so boring that Marques has to spend 3 minutes talking just about the usbc innovation is dead man
Its kind of the same I expected more tbh
Im just hoping they add a type C brick for new iPhone users in the package
Magnification options like 12x might be an optics offset for those using lens attachments to avoid vignetting
GOOG 8PRO PIXEL IS WHERE IT IS AT
iPHONES ARE BLAND AND BORING
Does the IPhone 15 have the auto enhance camera feature like it does on the 13  14 Im so tired of this feature on my phone Im hoping they took it out
I like to use the wired earphones and of course it has the lightning cable now Im losing that too
Captions do not sync what you say
Im an Android user so not really interested in Apple since 2012
Would you go for the 15 or the 15 plus
When is the 15 pro in Red comingg i need thatt
The target audience of the iPhone 15 isnt current iPhone users but long time android users like myself The ONLY reason I havent switched all these years is because of USBC Today I made the preorder for iPhone 15 Pro So glad to finally use a phone that goes well with my iPad MacBook and iMac
Its funny didnt you have that Essential phone you know the one with titanium that was way stronger than both the iPhone and Galaxy phones at the time Now you question the strength of this phone 
Coming from the XS Max hope it delivers like this phone did Only reason Im getting the 15 is because my battery takes forever to charge I couldve got a new battery but wanted a new phone
All the reasons are driving me to buying the iPhone 14 pro  funny 
Marques do you think we can change iPhone 15 pro max usb c to usb c 4
Hows it the 23rd iPhone 
"Can someone give me advice
I want to upgrade from my 13 to a pro max just because Ive always wanted to go to the pros and I really like the new notch look"
This aint nothing new
Already Pre Ordered the 15 Pro Max Upgrading from 13 Pro Max
Will buy an iphone only when they start providing fast charging on their phones
waiting on the iphone 18 for something new
Its great to see Apple taking over 3 years to get half way to my 2019 Huawei P30 Pro Keep going maybe next year youll match it I cant believe they would screw people with USB 20 and still no fast chargingbtw that depth of field choice after taking the photo Ive also been using it for over 3 years Welcome to pro photography Apple
"your content is amazing
but captions did not match the voice

I am buying it AGAIN
"European Union is forcing Apples hand anyway  It just makes sense for them to adopt it

Upgrading new iPhone every year"
Its just usbc nothing new at all Dont waste your money Getting tried of seeing the same thing every year
Kind of Interested to  Dont care Apple phones are now overpriced Thanks for the video
i am in the definitely getting one camp
"Camp dont care unless my job offers the upgrade  Definitely sticking with my iPhone 13 as my work phone   The only reason I have an iPhone is cause my job paid for it  

Personal phone is z fold 4 to game and watch movies  Its a conversation started too"
Yep Xmass is coming up and these 12yrs kids need to update old iPhone 14 to the new iPhone 15 which looks and operates the same as the old one
Hey Marques just letting you know the closed caption does not sync with video It seems like the closed caption is from another video altogether
ive always been an iphone user but im slowly thinking to switch to android starting to annoy me like they purposely added the slow usb c so that they can update it on the next iphone all them rubbish features will slowly be added as thats how they mkae their money i think apple users should stop upgrading every year and do it every 23 years
I purchased an iPhone X last year after viewing your movie and an iPhone 14 Pro before that For me this year is a skip I appreciate the reviews as always
"Apple is amazing at releasing new products with 5 year old technology and have everyone eat it up I give huge props to Apple for capitalizing on dumb ass people It goes to show how zombie like the current world is Congrats again to Apple for taking advantage of world wide stupidity

Oh and Marques Apple didnt include fast charging on the 15 Pro because that will be headlined as cutting edge technology for the iPhone 17 Pro in 2 years from now"
Looks the same  Not needed 
One thing this video didnt cover  a moment of silence for all Apple fans who invested hundreds in Lightning connectors
I cant wrap my head around that people are excited about USB C feature in 2023 for 1200 Its uncomprehensible to me
Slow clap for Apple finally crossing the finish line they made it guys
i still have an iphone 11 so this feels like a good time to upgrade but i dont really need the pro the only thing that could convince me is if you could map functions to action button doublepress and longpress so i could have 3 different functions for the action button doesnt look like that will be the case for launch but im very curious to see if that will ever be added if not ill probably end up with the basic iphone 15
I thought theyll integrate some AI features into this
Would be really cool if the action button could be used for the Tesla app to lockunlock your car Doubt Tesla would do that as it would discourage purchase of their physical key but I think they should look into that
Thank EU for bending Apple over the USB C compliancy 
I think its absolutely bonkers that a new phone dropped and its most exciting features are yearsold USBC and a bixby ahem action button Lmao
Why is the subtitles not matching the audio
why the basic version is still 60hz
Glad Apple finally added USBC about 10 years after Microsoft had it on Windows Phone
Having an extra cable dont bother me so much idk why people make a huge deal about it
Are they in the apple stores to view 
Cant wait for the iphone 16 and 17 
Welp time to get last years version
Crazy how much crap the iPhone can get away with Stuff that if other brands did everyone with be talking bad about
"Apple is facing a shift in the customers sentiment The inflation and interest rate have led to people deciding to keep their phone longer or to look at cheaper alternatives
Smart customers are keeping their cellular phone longer because they are realizing that the newer iPhone does not bring significant new feature that is justifying spending money for
This trend is confirmed by the interviews of the Cellular phone companies on CNBC MSNBC and Bloomberg"
While USB 20 specification has a 480 Mbits max speed the spec does not require the implementing chip to be capable of transferring at that speed The iPod I bought in 2004 supported USB 20 but when measured it only supported 15 Mbits way below the max theoretical speed for the spec So yes it also supported FireWire but only for marketing purposes

new phone also allows stereoscopic video recording for the Apple vision pro
Im in camp TOTALLY GETTING ONE OF THEEEEESE
When the USB port is the highlight 
Still cant beat the Huawei 60 pro lol
iphone 15 is the biggest joke of the year 
I wish they had changed the charging port on the 14 I hate having to use different cables on my IPad and IPhone
Who saw the video of his camera
What if you accidentally tap the button while in pocket will it activate How sensitive is it lol
Useless IPhone
So pretty much the same phone with a different housing Lol wow so Amazing Lol
No reason for a upgrade
Great video where can I find the wallpaper in the thumbnail
Does the action button turn off locations gps quickly to save battery
They are saving fast charging for iPhone 16 Pro
Captions are behind or ahead cant tell
Trying not to laugh ha
Its only worth changing iPhone every 6 years to see the difference
Great review Marques still deciding if its worth upgrading from my 13 pro to the 15 as a content creator
USBC is not as durable as previous charging port APPLE MESSE DUP ON THAT ONE IMO
Closed captioning is mustached
I had a work iPhone when My dept took over the cell phones we switched to android companywide minus 5 executives  good riddance But not having to deal with special cables makes sense
154 It already did 10th Gen has USBC
Now when people ask me do I have a charger I cant say its an iPhone charger anymore
They say that usbc is such a huge think but they just had to make it cause of the EU
Welcome to team android to all iPhone users  ya really cant say anything that new iPhone is half an android phone now 
About the action button why did they have to put it way up left corner of the phone  very uncomfortable reaching yo hand
"Fast changing kills your battery as it generates more heat

One thing about the USBC connector Apple designed it and holds the patent on it They were the first company to release a product with a USB connector Lightning cables are not passive they communicate with the phone to identify itself Not sure how they are handling that with the USB port"
you forgot to mention the battery last longer in the iphone 15 pro max than the pro
for the average person what iPhone still available offers the most value
Charging my AirPods with my phone isnt coolits stupid
I think Im finally upgrading from the 11 pro to one of the 15s But Im stuck and cant pick a modelso 11 pro Sounds good
Hi is there a problem with discolouration   On the Frame of titanium as BGR reported
WHEN CAN WE SEE THE MOON on iphones
to be honest this just came up on recommendation started to look for about a minute and then I asked myself do I really care I still use the 6 and I cant afford a new 15 and do I really need or want one  you all know my answer
Behave marques Pls put ur 14 past review link in this video instead take a review
Is there a reason why the new portrait mode isnt coming to the iPhone 14 Pro It has the same chip and arguably an equal or better camera than the iphone 15 The portrait feature is dependent on processing and like I said the chips are the same
I still prefer my old xs 256GB
me that still using iphone 8 have to replace the battery cause it drains out so fast TT
Man on what part its brighter than iPhone 14 Display also totally the same as well as dynamic island
I think there is a problem with your subtitles It says something completely different
Hi subtitles are not synced
Half of the iphones are sold through mkbhd
"Still impressed that we live in an era where gaming desktops are of the same price as the phones including with the fact that gpus are overpriced 

And still all you can do is watch yt do some games and do some light office work Oh and take okayish photos Such a pitty A pc in your pocket locked out of full potential"
mkbhd The captions on the video is all wrong
Might wait until the preorder hype dies down a bit but definitely interested in usbc for all my chargers Rockin an iPhone 12 right now so its probably about time to replace
12 million views in 4 days
I wish samsung wouldnt have gotten rid of the button or the sd card tray
Im sticking with the 13 mini until its not supported anymore or they bring it back
I thought iphone 6 was the latest 
Wow this video is absolutely mindblowing You are truly inspiring Keep up the amazing work and I cant wait to see whats up next 
When will they release the model with a consistent back gesture
 Ha So everything has price Even mkbhd You are so far from 4 years a go that I know you No truth and only covering the products failures
Same thing different names  Apple though Samsung is way ahead Will stick to my 13pro max for another year its still solid
a new phone means faster chip better cameras thats basically it for android and applephones are at the most they can do now
I stream arcade games and the preset focal length would be nice so its always set for that
"Apple Were introducing USBC
Meandroid user  weve been using that for years now
Apple But we have USBC 20 for base version and USBC 30 for Pro  Pro Max
Meandroid user  weve been using USBC 32 version for a while now
Apple How about the new Action button huh Huh 
Meandroid user  weve had that years now by either writing letters on the screen to take you to its function or by simply double or triple clicking the existing buttons that will serve as an Action button "
props to Apple for adding USB 2 to a 2023 flagship phone
Not worth the upgrade
Apple is smart they invested on good hardware and software basics and then attracts people by gradually absorbing and retweaking old tech from other phones and slapping the apple logo into it making people think theres something new but theyre paying 35 times more for bare minimum features and for the apple name so they can feel upper class lol
Cant wait for the Pixel 8 Pro review
ill proabably upgrade 14 pro max from  my 13 pro max im not ready for that usb c wish tyhye made both options
The only reason Im considering the smaller size 15 pro is because I currently have the iPhoneX
Switching from an iPhone 13 Pro and looking forward to ditch all lightning cables and only having to carry one cable plus Garmin charger going forward
"Its crazy how in a matter of just a couple years
the tech industry went from inviting zero
YouTubers to these events to Apple quoting
Marques in the opening presentation about the
MacBooks That was really exciting to see"
Fast charging will come as a new feature in iphone 16
Its insane that Apple doesnt have fingerprint scanner yet Dont they understand that its the basic necessity for any phone Facial detection is deeply flawed
Apple make fools to buyers same shit in new box
Rocking my 14 pro till the wheels fall off
Not just USBC  Thats right USBC 20 
I wonder why the Iphone 14pro is gone from apple website you can still buy the regular 14 but then jumps to 15 an 15 pro
iPhone has not changed their phones in the last 4 models laughable to claim theres a new phone its just the next one it isnt new lmao
huawei mate 60 pro  review 
"Looks the same as the older ones
Nothing really different boring"
Can I dock 15 Pro Max into my HP G5 and use it like my Note8 could do seven years ago like a desktop with two DVI and keyboard and mouse
Being lighter would help the glass not break
I ordered the Iphone 15 pro max and Apple series 9 just a few days ago and I am excited
iPhone is running late in technology 2023 still no reverse wireless charging 
I hate usb c to me the lightning port just differentiates iPhone from every other phone
Is the regular iPhone 25 worth 1060 bc that is how much it costs in Croatia
Your favorite feature android has had for six years No innovation after Tim Cook Just small changes to drain your wallet
You said 48 mix chip or is it really 48 mix because we have 12 mpx starts from iPhone 6
I feel like we arent using the MagSafe capabilities to its fullest potential Why arent we able to use it to charge another iPhone or AirPods as we would with a wireless charger
your captions are always off 
Anyone have a source for that wallpaper from the thumbnail Ive found the artist but cant find that particular dune wallpaper
You need to fix the captions
Well Ive always bought a new iPhone every year but this year I will not buy an iPhone because nothings changed I have an iPhone 14 promax does the same thing that the 15 ultra does so I buy a new phone I think a lot of people are not gonna buy this new phone because it just does the same things as the other phones I dont know what to be expecting but I wouldve really liked to have where the camera is located where it shows the time and whether in the back of the phone that wouldve been nice then I wouldve bought the phone but I dont think Im gonna buy this phone at all for me or for anybody else not even for my friends and girlfriends
What they introduced is pretty much nothing
Waste of money on something that we got with other phones 6 years ago
Im sticking with my iPhone 13 mini  I hate large bulky phones and LOVE the minis small form factor Its a little powerhouse with a very good camera I can operate it easily with one hand and plop it into almost any pocket and go  Sadly Apple has discontinued the mini lineup Thats a shame because there is a market for people who dont want to carry around almost tabletsized smartphones  So no  Im not excited at all by the 15s and will use my mini until it dies or is no longer supported
15 Pro  Pro in name only I am not spending that huge amount of money without ALL the cutting edge features 15 Pro max is far too large for me I am extremely annoyed by the lack of the 5 x optical zoom on the 15 Pro Keeping my money in my pocket and waiting to see next year if they see sense with the 16 Pro If not the 15 pro will already by much cheaper by then
Changes USBC  Nothing here make me want to upgrade But keep up the hype  Maybe Apple will send you free stuff
why does it seem like youre not impressed with new updates on the Iphone
Im so happy that the video that you kinda speculated did not happen The only wireless Iphone charging vid
no thanks I will keep my 13 Pro Max for another year
Wait what about Apple CarPlay on older vehicles would any USBC cable still read it as Apple car play
True fan boy even a basic iPhone is still super hyped Good job
"Apple lost innovation
Without innovation unwanted commercial advertising people are foolish
 iPhone 6 better"
now I remember what  I was going to say thanks my case got old and dried then cracked due to a lack of moisture then I used a masking tape to repair it so it looks old and worthless maybe u can doing
mersi frate
Customizable Bixbie button on iPhone That is a revolution
Please fix the subtitles
What wallpaper is that on the thumbnail I want it
Apple got jokes  basically 15 pro max is 13 pro max With minor changes on camera and brightness  I did the comparison not worth the upgrade
Apple really messed up on this one No way Im using that Android Charger 
Cool device waiting on the 16 though
They couldve left the nut switch as it was and make the power button the action button It wouldve been easier to just use the right hand thumb But how replaceable will this button be
Action buttonseriously
Why usb c but not battery with display is annoying
Why usb c for this much years
"Im still rocking the iPhone XR and Ive not had any issues with it since buying it but maybe its finally time for an upgrade
The cameras on the newer models will blow my single lens setup out of the water Having said that I own a proper camera anyway so im not sure if 1000 is really worth spending if I dont encounter any issues with my trusty XR"
I wish apple was more innovative with the tech and designs I love apple but feel like iphones have gotten less exciting every year
Iphone users can finally borrow charger from friends with android
Apple is an psychic Demon 
This one is just like the last years model
Apple iPhone same as 2k
"just to say your subtitles are completely out of time 
for the viewers who use them might help idk"
"if anyone sees this please help me out

base iphone 15 799 has same camera as 14pro now all I care about is camera"
This worth upgrading to Or switching brands completely I have a 12 pro max that the charge port is starting to mess up and it loves to get hot when using on cellular service Any other phones you recommend that would be the go to
Apple AKA Ripp off How can you not have fast charging on a 1200 phone 3x zoom on the smaller Pro phone joke
ahh shit here we go again
to be HONEST nothing changed
So like ummmm basically its the same thing apple  takes whats already out an repackage it an make it look like the new best thingthey had to step the camera up have you seen the pics from the Samsung ultra usbc wow  how long has this been around  Look  as far as Im concerned they are behind I am a apple user but the upgrades are like ok still waiting for a upgrade
Its the same Phone guys 
Fast Charging will be the UPGRADE for Iphone16   R O F L
I was really looking for a screen upgrade on the pro  A tougher screen is desperately needed and this is stopping me from rushing to get one the case is more than strong enough  Keeping my 12 pro max as can continue using all the chargers already have otterbox and this just is not even much better than my 12 pro max
Is it me or is the Closed Caption extremely off
I think its boring
Im mostly just excited that Apple finally produced a true all black iphone
Bruhh Apple is losing market fr
this is like stealing a picture from someone else and just changing the colors
Its 2023 and Apple still sucks
Is it only me or these new iPhones look ugly with all those cameras I mean I get it they have them for better quality for photos but who uses their phone to shoot an 8k documentary
Im confused why so many YouTuber creators are raving over the action button like its something new  not mentioning that its something Samsung has been able to do with its power button for years  Although Marques did say a lot of the new features arent exactly new  I havent seen anyone call this feature out directly yet  I guess its like all the fuss over being able to customize the lock screen  When Apple finally gives you something you gotta make a big deal over it no matter how small
But you say in your previous video apple wont come with type c
Action button can be used only for just 1 option Could action button do double press triple press hold for 2 secs and have 3 options
When they going to change the body of the phone 12   13    14   15   They look the same
Coudnt go more than half way through Too much trying to hide the elephant in the room Honest feedbacks 
With the Pro chip name change how will they keep the current chip trend going forward Whats gonna happen when next years base model 16 gets this years pro chip  Will they change the chip name to A17 bionic Cant have the A17 Pro in a nonpro phone Maybe all the chips will be called Pro starting next year  
My iPad pro already had USB c my Samsung already has a mappable side button Lol only thing new in these is the chips
just as an Android user I could not imagine switching to apple and going backwards on this stuff like ya the processor is really good but not really by much anymore with the new snapdragons but the ONE thing I use daily is fast charging Like how do you get forced to go to usbc then give the middle finger to your buyers and make it shity
Im still running the same phone I got in 2018 
Lmao if the EU didnt threaten Apple they quite literally wouldve not changed anything to these phones
I cannot buy But Thank GOD atleast I can see iPhone 15 pro 
They lost a court action they had no choice about the C cable theyve been ripping the public off for years
First time in 5 years Im not upgrading my phone disappointing
Hey Marques could I have any one of your smartphones
BILLIONS spent on research and development just to be the last company to figure out how to put USBC into a phone
Lama lama mirip sama kayak android
"I just got my iphone 13 and it is amazing its so smooth compared to my old samsung j7
Its a whole next level"
I upgraded earlier this year to the iPhone 14 pro max purple and I love it Its nice to see all the new features especially USBC but for now Im good with my 14 pro max Itll be nice to see how IOS 17 will work with my phone
Am I the only one feeling like no real new feature was added
Definitely staying with my iPhone 14 pro
make it double sim much better having two phone more reliable
Was really nice seeing a quality produced series and Adam back in his elementary professionally
I have an iPhone XI need the XV
Ugh I just want expandable memory microSD
The cam has only 5x zoom FFS Apple really
Apple cults
honestly disappointed
I was going to upgrade but seems like I should be fine for another year with this 13 pro max 
still no fold able i phonesadlyno time for me to update to i phone 15to expensive for my wallet
Its just an old usb c bro Dont shill Thunderbolt 5 was announced how do you even justify this
Im not sure whether to buy the iphone 15 or iphone 14 I dont mind the notch on the 14 but if Im buying a new phone to last 3 years or more will the notch look even more dated It seems likely but is it really worth spending more on the 15 for that reason If the camera is a big step up and if there is even more battery power efficiency then perhaps But in terms of design are the bezels thicker on the 15 From what Ive seen from the pictures they look like they are which I dislike more than the notch Hmm
"Ugghthat 60hz

Apple is getting really stingy year on year and its our fault"
based on what ive seen i think this is one of the biggest generational leaps apple or any smartphone manufacturer has done in a very long time i dont think i have ever been hyped for an apple product until now particularly the 15 pro kinda sucks cause im a broke college student and cant get it anyway sticking with my iphone X for as long i can it seems
guys i have the 13 pro max thinking of going for 15 plus will it be worth upgrading
I really dont care about 60120174362727 hz screens I just want PWM flicker free screens Im sick of this 10 of the people have that and nobody is doing anything really
This guy normalises everything 
Yet people still buy this even its still looks same smh
If u on a budget stick if u a baller like me get it
Since they care about the environment they could have easily upgraded the software of the old phones to be just like the new phones
really nice
The chip in iPhone 15 pro is named A17 pro so that when they release iPhone 16 nonpro model they can release it with a normal A17 chip to increase the difference between iPhone 16 pro and non pro models
Anyone got a link to the wallpaper in the thumbnail
obviously apple is out of ideas but apple fanatics will still line up to get one and give away their money for absolutely no valid reason  deserving festere apple didnt even bother to make the bezel as thin as other flagship phones
I would leave that iconic and unique mute switch you can tell your phone is on mute by feel in your pocket instead of looking at the screen add a button to the power side for actions
oh What A video
African brother explained so good 
because iphone is so arrogant that they didnt want to change to usbc
1k for a 60hz display pannel in 2024
The USBC is great but its only USB 2 with very slow transfer speeds compared to USB 3 that Android uses Thats pretty sad for a 2023 1000 Iphone
"iPhone 15 pro no fast charging with USBC 
Well we now know whats new on the 16 pro"
a disappointing update Not something very monumental and its high time they change the design especially the camera set up
subs are incorrect I guess
i think theres some caption problem
They even replaced the GPS system with NavIC system btw
Just preorder mines as long Apple keep the same design I am a fan I was so in love with the Iphone 4 designed and when Iphone 12 came on the seen was so happy lol
i will charge it with xiaomi120watt charger
The Pro can also output video to SSD via USBC
Marques could not criticise the iPhone 15 phone as much as he would have liked because Tim Cook mentioned his name Its clearly not an iPhone 15 it should be iPhone 14s Great ploy by Apple
"MKBHD usbc
EU you are welcome"
Why is MKBHD still doing Anker sponsorships after the Eufy stuff
"So to sum it up
its overall slightly better than the last and has a USB C port without using the capabilities this standard brings 
And it has a button instead of a switch 
Is this really considered a new iPhone
Meanwhile the Fairphone 5 has arrived and it seems no one cares"
You are doing this from your heart 
Wonderlust
I still cant get over apple when they got rid of giving people a charger with their iphone because they  care and are trying help the environment Meanwhile they make phones in obsolescence and pump them out every year
The design of the iPhone is just like that Wkwkwk
Crazy cause I feel cheated for buying the 14 pro max
"Sometimes I winder how new iPhones would look if Steve Jobs would still be alive I dont think Apple would be in turtle mode like now He would have been inovating Maybe even break the standard 2d space of the phone Maybe holograms maybe 3d screens based on the position of your eyes Just saying So many possibilities
But no instead Apple chose to milk the cash cow until people get tired of it and they lose market share more and more Sad I wish it wasnt like that so I could switch back to iphones"
HUAWEI  
dynamic island should have been free for everyone on 14 now they just yeeting all the pro features in to the basic 15 smfh what a scam
I like how the title said it all its like apples finally gives you Typec and some other stuff as the title
I hate how Apple made the Apple Watch 9s precision finding work only with the iPhone 15s
Its indeed not just usbc As for the normal models its an usb c connection with usb 20 speeds Love it
Sick of apple with the same phone Im not upgrading until they change the design
Camera specs are trash  Apple does not lie about the zoom capability but they dont tell you how they accomplish 120mm in focal length  You are actually cropping from the 12 MP sensor that apple claims it 48 MP to around 15 MP image quality picture  This is why math was so important in school people  You are all getting fooled with firmware and numbers that only benefits apple tells you  Meaning apple only tells you part of the equation that sounds good to give you 120mm focal
Your subtitles are not matching bro please edit nicely before posting
I think Apple should give a discount to devoted Apple customers who have faithfully purchased a new phone every year
No matter what the Title says I still say its just a USB C in new iPhone
They should improve PC compatibility
So To wrap upnew updates are USC C steel frame new bionic chip  and fee new color may be thinner what else guys And yeah price goes by 100 US more than last year for Pro
Good im sticking to iph 14 pro
"Apple does nothing and this dude be like WOW 
Samsung does everything and this dude be like wow I cant see Im blind"
CRINGE HOW THEY CALL EVERYTHING PRO NOW
"Me watching the video 
Me reading the captions "
A lot of people are saying its not worth it and I get that if you have a 14 pro but Im coming from a 12 pro and I cannot wait for the changes Im gonna have to
Iphone same old design why cant they come up with a new design like Samsung does  Im thinking of leaving iPhone
Not a hate statement but phones are always advertised to be 10 faster lol Cant wait til they can make them 100 faster 
hey might wanna look at the subtitles  They dont seem to match the content you are speaking
Yeah apple is the best They have USBc port on a phone now 
Why is usb such a big deal I dont get it
Great Content thank you The subtitles are not accurate
If you have a 13 its pretty much the same phonenot worth dropping a stack for a for a usb c port that doesnt fast chargei think this is the least exciting iphone yet
"Think Apple has made too many mistakes with this phone Nothing new nothing more innovative no fast charging same design Just more cash for nothing

Looks like iPhone users are always kicking android to the ground Lets take a minute to recap on afew things

Apple was fined for deliberately slowing down older phones to buy there latest a greatest So they committed fraud Was it 21million

Also Apple are way behind on stuff which android came out with years ago

Android will always be far superior

Micro SD card slot
USBC
Super fast charging from 20w to 120w
New designs from every manufacturer and not the same shit every year
Ip68 water proofing warrantied
New snapdragon mediatek and Exynos chipsets
High refresh rate screens
Open source for downloading
App multiscreen use
Ultra sonic Finger print readers
Torrent downloading
Not locked into iTunes
Simple drag and drop
Phones capable of upto 16 GB of ram
Not been charged extortionate amounts of money for extra storage
iPhones use Samsung and LG AMOLED screens
New and different camera sensors from various manufacturers like Sony IMX and Samsung etc
Bigger batteries or partitioned batteries for super fast charging
split screen multitasking
Vapour chambers to dissipate heat
OTG on the go plug in a usb drive for anything from music videos films or additional backup

There is a budget for everyone on the Android market and not charged a premium for apples same stuff every year Personally I wouldnt trust them after there history

If you want a phone which can do whatever you want on it and not be restricted then go Android Not to mention they are always adding and refining the technology
If you want to be restricted we tell you to jump and you say how high then stick with Apple
But if you stick with Apples ecosystem they work seemingly well when everything is connected together"
I havent found this anywhere With USB C will there be anything more than a screen mirror when connected to an external display
no its exactly just iphone 14 with usb c
I use MagSafe wireless charging on my phone so the only thing I really get out of the USB is a transfer rate
Does it have a SIM card still
Ill be Ill be using that button for the flashlight lol
Here comes the apple fanboy
What the tech industry needs to most right now well one of the things that Needs lol is new battery tech the current battery technology is holding us back
Where it would be great and it wouldnt bother me because I upgrade to the latest pro model Every year fast charging would compromise the batteries health longterm a lot quicker than the current charging speeds for people that hold onto their phones longer than you or me they definitely would notice that in a couple years
iPhone Dont care Android
So basically only USBC is new
Smh so disappointing the same phone just USBc port wow apple amazing When will they make flip phones Or different models Something unique Apple is so behind they should just make cameras because thats the only good thing the iPhone is for
I am concerned that ProMax is relying on digital crops to provide images from 24 to 119 mm The Pro models 77mm camera may be better option this year as with it the 24mm only has to cover the range from 24 to 76mm then you have an optical 77mm With 5x digital crops in the mid range  end up being very small files see Tony Northrops review on this issue
In short its not worth getting but if you want to by all means go get the 15
Feels like watching a paid ad
Please anyone knows the name of the game in this video
thanks to EU This was implemented
Im keen on upgrading my 11 Pro Max to the 15 Pro Max I suspect Ill be more impressed with the new phone since Im still on the 11 I like the idea of being able to charge my AirPods with the phone And thank goodness theyve finally changed over to USBC Its about time
Even this year Ill buy next year
"An EUjob well done so far Even Apple has to bow to the regulators in Brussels
For the better this time"
Brhhh am confused anyone tell me something
I hope iPhone users are aware of how far behind ios is compared to android Takes apple forever to bring new features that android have had for years Its actually amusing to see how excited iPhone users get for old tech 
The USBC is just a legal obligation from the UE which forces all companies to adopt this system by 2024 as late SoThe major update doesnt even come from them  Apples innovation is DEAD
"Im still using my iPhone 8 Plus  The 12 MP camera still works for me and I just had a new battery installed
 Ill probably give in for the next new iPhone simply because of the endofsupport that will likely hit the 8 in the not distant future  I still have a perfectly good 7 6 and 5 but you cant get new replacement batteries any longer"
"Apple should understand they price iPhone decently
People do not think much putting big money buying them Why do they not give good features in non pro models
Ex type C 30"
145  he makes it feel as though Apple took one for the team by going usbc Someones been drinking a lotta Apple sponsored coolaid eh 
Apple was basically forced to use USBC I believe in 2024 the UK made it so all phones tablets and laptops need usbc Got to love government telling companies what to do
What an irony apple 
BFD
Wow It charges using USB What an innovation 
I am pretty sure Apple have Already have plans to sell their own USB C cablesi dont think other USB C cables would work in thos phones
"Looks up the specs of the phone

Realise my 630 phone has better to way better specs across the line

Checks the pirce 1479

Its a straight up scam and people are still buying into these I honestly do not understand this any more"
Why are the subtitles telling another story 
man i love europe for forcing iphone to do this
USB TypeC 20 speed protocol in 2023 Im Impressed
I love iPhone but I I wont be buying another one until Apple does something different Show some innovation Apple
Surely in a couple of years USBC will be replaced anyway
Basically its not even worth upgrading
everyone loves to hate on apple but theyre winning lol their build quality is top notch iOS is more secure it simply works better
I had a car crash with my iPhone 12 without its case it flew out of the window and landed on the asphalt The glass did not shatter nor did any part of it crack except the side Im pretty sure the ceramic shield is going to withstand the stuff you encounter on a normal day
the subtitle are out of sync 
I think Apple are laughing at everyone with this drip drip slight incremental upgrades Theyre not getting my money
So now will you be able to transfer files from your laptop to your iPhone using the TypeC cable
Marquese did you upload the wrong subtitles file for this video
May I know where to get these nice wallpaper 
Hi Im a midrange Android user but Ill be picking up my 15 Pro Max on Sep 22nd I understand that the Action Button can use Apples Shortcuts feature Does that mean that I could set the action button to function as a back button
I am still learning my 13Pro which I bought when it launched I like the 5x camera but the ProMax is too big for my hands so hopefully by the time of the iPhone 17 it will be in the Pro model  Four years seems to be my upgrade schedule
Can you give me an i phone for free if its possible 
and people will be dying to buy this
"Year 2023
Person I have a new Phone

Year 3023
Phone I have a new Person"
about the more reparable iPhone They had to do it anyway post the EU bill about  All smartphones including iPhones must have replaceable batteries by 2027 in the EU The decision could have a global impact The European Union is officially requiring all smartphones to have replaceable batteries by 2027  all smartphone companies eventually would be back to replaceable and reparable phones D
Hello  I think your subtitles are a bit out of sync  Please check it  Thanks
What happen to subtitles its not syncing
Oh wow it looks like every other iphone Seriously Apple
Why they never named an iphone 9
WHAT A SCCAMM UPGRADE
Iphone 15 1 step closer to Galaxy s23 ultra Long way to go but definitely 1 step closer
Ill wait till the 16
One thing with many not noticed check the website inside the box now iPhone 15 and series will get braided cable
nice they add stuff that yet again we got on android 6 year ago
Get ready for 60w fast charging in 2023
When you get paid and you gotta say only good things about an outdated phone
i like the look but i dont like the software
iphone stupid im glad i dont use it whats point of havin color phone when u gonna add case
I stick to the 14 pro max 
im sorry man i love your work but apple has became TRASH  innovation is long gone and people still buy it so why change anything
Every iPhone update is like farting while sitting in a bathtub
As per usual another good video Also the Anker stuff is looking pretty legit their small charging block is awesome
The iPhone 14s you mean
is it just me or are the subtitles completely messed up for everyone
Fast charging is bad for batteries  Longer lasting phones and less crap in the landfill Much better to not have it
The captions and transcript is talking about the Apple Watch It does not match the audio at all
using ifone 5 feels same as 15 regardless of all rest only digits r changed
But still the best design that the iPhone has ever made was for the iPhone 5sSE It is the bestdesigned iPhone that was ever produced
Same old design forcing me to go to Samsung
apple every year this is the best phone we ever created
As per lightening into usbc couldnt give less of a fuck if I tried
I literally have no idea why anyone would upgrade to a 15 from a 14 Or from a 13 Or from a 12 Or from an 11
Iphone 15 user cant borrow chargers from anybody who has an older iPhone model now 
link to wallpapaer pls
The fast charging feature will undoubtedly be the big selling point for the iphone 16 thats why they havent done it here
If you reduce some amount of treble from your videos damn sure I will each and every videos of yours
whats wrong with the captions or is it for me only
same shit in different colors with a higher price not just  shit 
Have been waiting to see the new phone Have switched between android and apple over the years and wondered if it may be time to try the iPhone again Currently have Samsung s22 ultra and it has been great especially the camera and charging speeds May have to wait to see some comparison videos of the cameras on the new iPhone and s23
damn i can finally get theiphone 11
S23 Ultra is still the best
"Not sure its worth the upgrade  If you dont care about carrying around a lightning cable and lets face it we have for years and you dont take a ton of photos Im in the camp that was never that bothered my phone had a camera then Im its all a bit meh  iOS 17 is nice but Ill still have that so Im good I think 

Next year maybe  Much like the MacBook Pro I have an M1 MacBook Pro and it does what I need it to do so no reason to buy a new one  Its the forced obsolescence when I can no longer upgrade the OS that makes the decision for me

What is interesting is the ability to take what are essentially stereoscopic photos that will be something that youll take advantage of with the new AR headset I forget what its called already  Im intrigued by this headset if its really has high definition as it looks to be then this really could be something  Like most people I know I laughed at the ridiculousness of being a a childs birthday party and taking a photo while wearing this cray headset but to be able to do this with your phone and then relive those moments in the headset  Yeah now that might encourage me to take more photos  If of course I can afford the crazy price for this thing

For me for now this Im keeping my 14 Pro Max"
"These brittle boring homogeneous devices have stopped being innovative The charging cable is the new feature let that sink in
The EU made apple change this apple battled the EU in court and lost 
A lack of innovation from apple is due to little to no competition Why cant we run apple os on a Samsung or Huawei device Apple have me locked in and they dont need to be innovate with urgency drip feed us features I wont buy this new phone Ill stick with my iPhone 12 Pro Max I replaced the battery and does everything Ive got used to"
Man i was really ready to switch from Android to IOS with this phone but the fast charging hurts compared to my Oneplus 
Might go android this year 
iPhone 11 V15 Apple cant design no more
I hope the EU will sue them for that USB 20 shit
The integrity of the battery drops significantly faster with fast charging iPhone batteries tend to deteriorate faster than android phone batteries so id understand why they shy away from superfast charging
339 Portrait mode is already there in Samsung for some time nothing seems new with Iphones lately they are only upgrading at fooling people and robbing more money for much less each year
Who did the Subtitles  AMazing
1115 lol  oh snap the guy from the podcast who uses the windows PC 
Apple were forced to use USBC by law so the fact that its the only realfeature is a complete joke Its like showing off your court mandated tag as a fashion accessory
I love my samsung s23 ultra 
The front camera on the iPhone 15 Pro Max is the same as whats on the basic iPhone 11 Joke
I swear I had a customisable button on my blackberry 10 years ago 
Losing respect for Apple every year They have the resources to make something truly innovative its just getting comical how small the improvements are getting Really love your videos MKBHD but try not to hide the disappointment so much
English subs are desynced
I still waitng new iPhone Thats not brand new one
it is ok to make money by telling no sense but could you please suggest Apple to make better improvement so you can BS about it easier 
"Headline not much has changed 

I feel like phones have reached the end of their life in 10 years everyone will have something different I dont know what it will be maybe some form of vrar I dont know But the last 3 iPhones have been pretty much the same"
Ive been watching you for soooo long like back when you used to show your frisbee competition Back when you were not this big like back in 2013
Didnt find anything impressive to upgrade from 14 Pro to 15 Pro
Its just a phonethe ad says for space exploration the titanium iPhone as if everyperson in the world is become a astronaut 
What an unfortunate Apple almost got me but I look for iPhone 16 pro max so iPhone 15 is not my thing Sad 
"The thing is why would anyone buy iPhone 15where they can buy 14 propro max instead for almost identical price

Is it better than 14 pro"
Whats the deal with the subtitles
That thumbnail though 
Hey Marques the subtitles are dodgy needs to be changed
Usbcwe dont use only wireless new chip iphone 14 pro chip is equally amazing new material we always use case protection I will keep with 14 pro max for now
"I do enjoy critical reviews in general However over the last years I more and more dislike your videos MarquesBrownlee Its because whenever it comes to Apple youre just full of negativity Eg this video you start of right away with negative stuff that seems to be your mantra nothing new all seen before in other smartphones 
This might be true for some features but why Start of with negative stuff This is not making me enthusiastic to watch your videos Especially since I noticed youre not being that harsh with other companies If I want to see roastings I specifically look for those videos
Sorry bro but u just lost a longtime supporter here"
Im getting one soon No rush since its reportedly sold out So do I want the pro or the pro max Im a lawyer the pro max display would be nice but maybe the pro will do just fine
apple so trash bruh
I not to long got my iPhone 14pro max after having the 12 pro max for a while I ALMOST got the 15 pro max I was soooo close but then I thought charging and an action button and 5x telescopic zoom I mean I am not a photographer and pretty much use my iPhone to do normal things like most the population so I will wait to see what the 16 pro max or 17 etc brings lol I will hold on to my 14 pro max for now
Iphone 15 is a Scam fr
Who else had issues with the captions 
Im saddened that they are now differentiating the Pro and Pro Max based not just on size fair but also technical capabilities cameras This is sad to see
The new iPhone bro the same thing again thanks
Your friends android phone
I just hate the fact that they praise it like their invention as always If the EU does not force them there wouldnt be any change to the port
"Im currently on iPhone SE2 2020 and want better battery life better camera and satellite SOS support

Ive been telling myself to get a new iPhone since last year but when I saw iPhone 14 in an Apple store the huge size and heavy weight was way too disappointing
Now this iPhone 15 is almost just an iPhone 14"
"Pink iPhone where can I buy

Fake news"
so apple be apple and making usb c slower lol
120hz
Apple is dead
Its the SAME phone  Just Type C zero difference for casual users
"Ive been holding out from upgrading my iPhone 12 Not to sure if I should go Pro or standard I enjoy taking photos but not to sure if the extra 
Is worth it"
Can you tell when we can expect some more hands on user experience content from you and other content creators  Like did you guys get a chance to take homebuy an iPhone before we do Would love to see some more while waiting on the arrival of mine Went with the 15 pro natural titanium 
"red camera 

"
Hey great vid But why is Picture in Picture working without premium just on this video
I have a 14 Pro Stupidly I was quietly hoping Apple would bring out something that made me really want to upgrade to something shinier But the progress is still iterative and safe I know Samsungs risks sometimes send them flying off the road but at least they show that courage Apple keeps talking about
Ive been able to program my side button on the samsung for years it operates my torch Basically they are launching a phone with virtually no changes at all except for usb and Ive already seen an iphone video where someone soldered a usbc port on their old iphone 6
INNOVATION
This gotta be a modern tech CoryxKemshin
Its one of them its difficult and challenging to make something every year thats exceeds the last gen Every year what else do people want them to add Like what else Pro gets the love as the base gets love a year old personally wanted to see AirPods Max 2 but maybe later in the yearnext year
I may lose my another kidney this year 
I feel disappointment Especially on fast charging
60hz Ok see you in a year
You have not talked about the new feature of using an external device directly to record video Can you please Thanks
"The action button is placed wrong for the ringer switch it made sense thats slightly out of the way to avoid accidental actions Now with the action button you already see Markes struggling to reach it with one hand so why not turn it into the powerSiri button and make the power the action button From a users standpoint I dont see the extra benefit here and I think that Apple wanted to make manufacturing easier for waterproofing and had to remove the rocker switch so they gave this instead

Lets wait and see off cours"
Whats the flight tracking app at 043
apple could have made the area on the right side of the camera module a touchaction control so that some features could be controlled with just holding the phone
Dont care was watching reviews to see if it was worth it Its not worth for me I have the iPhone 14 Pro Max
whats with comments theyre from different video
all they need to do is remove the torch from the Lock Screen Cant count the amount of times Ive accidentally turned this torch on inside my pocket and drained my battery This has been one of the WORST things bout iPhone for years Cant customise the Lock Screen
Nothing new but except type c
Also the base model iphone 15s have a 60hz refresh rate while the pro and pro max version have 120hz
I want the basic 15 Kinda sorry I went with the 13 Mini for my last iPhone and really want a slightly larger screen But Im actually jazzed about USB C so I can use one cable between the 15 and my iPad Pro Ive used USB C to Lightning adapters but they always feels like theyre stressing the port when plugged in I also am looking forward to Dynamic Island and the larger sensor in the camera Im however very unhappy that Apple has eliminated Apple Card 0 financing over 24 months unless you activate with a carrier WTF is that about I want my iPhone UNLOCKED and I shouldnt be penalized for it Last time they charged me a 30 penalty to buy a phone without activation but I could still get the financing deal Not anymore You now have to pay in full to get an unlocked iPhone The thing is I use two carriers and you cant do that with a phone thats carrier locked which is just another usage penalty on top of the financial penalty
I think Ill just stick with my old iPhone 7 
This should be the time to buy Lighting to Usbc adapters so you dont have to change all the cables and such
Thought it was titanium 
subtitles and video is not synced
ok so apple is taking the environment seriously XD
im waiting for ROB
Iphones look disgusting Cant believe this many years later and they still have a black bar blocking the top of the screen The ugly lenses no thanks
Nothing new as always USB android lol
USBC comes because of a decision from Europe
I had used the iPhone 14 pro leaving android It was a pain in the ass to type my password every time I had to install an App Very frustrating
So basically old android with apple glass back
hopefully apple make smart pen for iphone
Subtitles are of macbook air review
Back in 2007 Steve Jobs envisioned a phone that totally reinvents the phone  ever since the iPhone X that dream has failed
time to get this one charger for all my devices thats very convenient
I wonder if the iPhone 15 will be able to detect a usb c non apple branded charger and not charge as fast as an apple usb c charger
I know this is weird but I HATE the look of the action button menu It looks so tackyandroid
Iphone sucks
130
I never care about data transfer speeds with usbc because the last time I plugged my phone into a computer was like 2014
should i buy the Iphone 14 pro max now
finally that feels like 2016 phone now lol
Was an iPhone user for 10 years then got the Samsung zfold I miss using imessage with my family but thats about it If Apple came out with something revolutionary with the new iPhone I was considering to switch back but I am disappointed at the new iphone 15
For the pro they should have atleast  30 watt 1hour full charge
should people buy the 14pro or the 15
im fine w my 14 Pro Max
I remember when Steve Jobs was alive the changes every year were a lot more significant and whit every new iPhone the changes are less and less this is by far the worst
USBC wasnt an apple decision the European Union mandated it for them to be allowed to sell it in Europe
This has got to be the worst upgrade EVER its the same shit
English subtitles have wrong timing
Camp dont care at all Ill wait for the 16
Removing the tactile mute switch was a mistake
Hey man I just wanna say I use ADBLOCK and your captions are not synced with the audio since it delays like the first 15 seconds for the adverts
My iPhone 12 pro max has a C USB port
"Iphone sucks Glad Huawei is back Steve Jobs was a selfish dictator And it beggars belief you indoctrinated muppets STILL stuck with them after their corruption scandal Heres a suitable motto

 Apple  Rotten to the Core  Steve Jobs 

"
What was up with the captions on this video being for Apple Wonderlust instead of the 15 review
Waste of money apple
closed captioning is on point
Just stick to your phone until it breaks down dont full for this type of capitalism
I really do love all my Apple devices  except the iPhone AirPods iPad MacBook Apple TV etc are just flat out better than competitors but having to deal with iPhone to complete ecosystem sucks
No point to buying this iPhone 15 or Pro versions when it comes to practicality Average user doesnt use the cinematic video  editing as they have specifying on their official cuts However when USB C was not a big deal for other smart mobile users as well Again less practicality and kind of wast money
Im getting one but thats cause I dont have the 14 Im interested in the satellite feature more than anything Also doesnt hurt to finally switch to usbc Now I just have to pack one cable instead of two
WOW how technology has advanced over the years
Natural is my favorite color too
I have only one kidney remaining now please advise 
Same price is a good thing their getting to expensive no glass on the back that killed my iphone
Awesome This will mean that I can find cheap USB cables whenever Im on a trip or something rather than a million different colors of lightning cables
I personally do not like the brushed sides of the 15 Pro and Pro Max versions It looks cheap to me compared to the shiny sides on the 1214 PMs which looks very premium The brushed sides remind me of the old iPhone 6 series Im currently on a 12 PM and may upgrade to a 14 PM I havent seen anything from the 15 PM that makes me want to jump on that Too many tiny incremental upgrades What do you all think
Speaking as someone who doesnt even like or use Apple I think USBC is a failed attempt and Apple did everything right with Lightning especially the MFi part The reason is simple I now have no fewer than a dozen high quality USBC cables for USB 303132 thunderbolt converter cable to type B and all that not only does every cable fail to negotiate with the various devices theyre supposed to connect or vice versa but even charging isnt guaranteed because theres always some party in the chain that dont fully incorporate every possible USBC function that will leed to failing to connect No user should be made to feel stupid just becasue their supposedtowork cables are too smart
Thanks
Just couldnt get my mind off the action button being on to of the volume button It seems more comfortable if its below the volume button Just makes it easier to press
i am still waiting for an iphone flip phone so tempted to switch to samsung
Thank you Marques Nothing to excite me with their announcement In fact I would have been more interested if they had told the EU to piss off we will continue with our own designs
Excellent to the point and as usual no holding back on comments that Apple mite wish he had said differently  Like the held back downloading  charging speed of the USB No no children u cant get all the expected benefits in one go   Thks Marques good one
If you multiply the versions of iphones made by the protocol of USB the iphone 15 Pro uses  it equals
Im excited for iPhone 16
Nononono you dont know it will come to usbc The eu that successfully forces you to do that
I think its called a17 pro bcoz next year for iphone 16 it will be jst a17
So this is How Paid Review Looks Like Thanks for giving an example
Sooo the only new is type C plug great
This is why I still have my Galaxy 
Not worth
"I still have iPhone 7 Plus and I was really looking to upgrade this year but I dont see any huge differences between 14 and 15 

I think Ill either switch to Android or wait for the 16 "
Android typeC is that similaror different type of C port in iPhone
Lightning is FAR from dead SO many people are still using and will continue using older iPhones Lightning is still here for a little while
Im surprised they didnt make a special American i Phone 15 with lightning
upgrading from iphone 12 and my pro max is preordered till early october 
Why should you even upgrade Does slight camera upgrades 1 GPU core dynamic island 24 added pixels USBC the only thing it seemingly has going for it which is an industrial standard across all other phones and about 1 hour of more battery life which is probably not a constant For context I have an iPhone 13 and the camera is better but mines just fine for what I need to use it for I cant justify paying 900 iPhone 15 256gb for a better camera and usbc Not to mention the Titanuim actually 60 heavier than aluminum and their marketing says its lighter the iPhone 15 is lighter without titanium I think Apple really missed a mark on this one and basically once again upgraded a camera and gave us USBC Please share your thoughts Much appreciated and thank you for the video
I am happy about the USB C but on the other hand I havent had to plug a cable into my iPhone for years Wireless headphones wireless internet wireless charging cloud etc
was I the only one who had a delay in the captions
Ive been using an iPhone for nearly a decade  I have always loved the eco system l  Lately however Ive been contemplating weather I would like to make a change to Android  In my opinion not much has changed on the iPhone for a while and would simply consider trying something new
Do basically do what Android phones have veen doing for so long
Big new feature    an old technology where is the innovation from apple Also funny was green washing presentation Apple releases every year a new iPhone how is that protecting the environment
Is the CC messed up and running the watch videos CC
Youre an Inspiration brother 
"Man Iphone 15 256GB 
Iphone 15 plus 128GB
which one will you suggest"
So the iPhone 15 literally stole everything from an Android and called it a day and the best part is that they act like they have done something revolutionary that the world has never seen so that dumb people can buy the same product they have been selling for several years
One piece
Should I get iPhone 15 or 15 Pro just for prospects of listening lossless music via usb c cable I havent see any YouTuber explaining about it Thanks in advance
"Question Why are the closed captions completely different from anything Marques is saying

Edit It is only the standard CC that is vastly different auto generated is just fine"
i used to enjoy your reviews  Apple ruined the experience now theyre just YouTube videos
"If you look at the iPhone 15 Pro Max and break it down its not the snooze fest many have been claiming

Ray Tracing hardware
Bigger Battery
8 Gb Ram
3nm chip set
Titanium
Smaller bezels 
5x Optical zoom
light increase camera 2x
tetraprism design camera
USB C
Faster Data transfers 20x
WiFi 6E
Main camera 24megapixels
4K 60fps video
External storage transfer 
Neural Engine 2x Faster
CPU 10x faster
GPU 20x faster 
AV1 decoder
Action button
More rounded chaise 

Lots of changes and improvements here more then enough for me to upgrade"
Seems like Apple hasnt been innovating for almost a decade
If you have an iPhone 14 pro or Pro Max the upgrade is DEF not worth it Hold onto it til the 16 comes out
Ill tell you what it reminds me of sort of reminds me of the iPhone 14 or even maybe the iPhone 13
Im going from the IPhone X to the 15 this year Im stoked
Not getting i only got a 13pro for the pro motion im pretty much not ever upgrading until this phone doesnt work any more no more reasons to upgrade for me atleast but i do like to see new phones so thanks for the video as always
Apple refuses to pay royalties on fast charging patents They would rather you dont get fast charging than pay someone else If they can get away with using patented technology without paying they will try They have been sued for more than a billion dollars in the last 4 years for not paying patent holders Its kind of hard to hide fast charging capabilities without every fast charging patent holder coming for their money
Same shit same phone
great review as always 
Its junk Just tell the truth about the camera and the weak port
USBC 20 in 2023 The joke tells itself
yo the captions are hosed on this video Do what you will with this information
One thing that wasnt mentioned I hear I can record video directly to an external USBC SSD Very unApple but looking forward to it
I got the 14 pro max recently switched from android wont be upgrading for awhile Although the usb type c would have been nice so I didnt have to buy different charging cords 
Pretty goofy how their headlining feature is a USBC
Well Apple finally catching up Ive had USB c and that button that opens any app for well years on android
Usb type c is the single greatest unification ive ever seen
That type c port only work with expensive Apple certified type c cable
When you realize subtitles talking different 
Im happy to see the 48mp camera on the cheaper iphone Might consider getting one
Did they fix the battery issues
great moment to buy an iphone 14 pro from another retailer as the price will lower
USBc change is to satisfy the EU regulation Following Parliaments approval EU consumers will soon be able to use a single charging solution for their electronic devices By the end of 2024 all mobile phones tablets and cameras sold in the EU will have to be equipped with a USB TypeC charging port From spring 2026 the obligation will extend to laptops
"Ive never been more bored by a phone keynote ever

Actually wait The Iphone 6s to the 7 was a slightly more painful launch They manged to launch the 6s but without a headphone jack and sell it for flagship prices

This all really feels like a massive amount of ewaste to relaunch what amounts to mostly extreamly minor tweaks and software updates"
Whats the point changing to usbc if they still put some restrictions on it The point is to enables backward compatibility across other tech right But apple still doing their thing restricted the charging speed if its not their usbc or with their chip Please just sue apple
No price increase for Pro Max models Why do people keep saying price increase
I just learned about your channel I have to say Im impressed on the quality This is real good content
Its always the same crap Nothing really new
No one cares if other phones had something first Utter meaningless fanboy nonsense
hows the battery life compared to the 14 pro im not having much luck with my 14 pro
Its crazy that Apple has such a toxic culture that people will buy this phone over food and shelter Lets perpetuate that
Yeah Apple had an opportunity to say hey we didnt change the port because the EU said so it was to introduce THESE improvementsl
Look same crab as 5 years ago Wow upgraded camera and processor So disappointed  Nothing new
So apple phones are getting an android charger Hilarious 
Bro definitely out the hood Jesus
can we get new AirPods Pro case usb c to charge old ones
Iphone 15  USBC  Shortcut Button
Finally upgrading from my iPhone 8 Plus Just put in my preorder today for the 15 Pro Max 1TB
iPhone pro user every year for years Dont care about anything but making my phone not horrifically slow and work all the bugs out Cant make a note and go back to it without it being completely blank Or actually make a phone call and hear someone
The subtitles are from a different video sir
I dont care about upgrading to newer versions since they dont offer significant improvements Its become quite a boring design
So iPhone 15 does the same thing as my iPhone 8 Plus
What case you recommend ordered the max pro
As much as I love tech and innovation but coming out with new phones every year is overkill How about every 2 years I feel the jump between phones isnt worth the upgrade
Besides of that Everything is same thing Same size andddd same starting prices  this is the most hilarious thing ever on phone review You all can see how weak and scared this company to take any risk of new changes
Tony Northrup scorched Apple for their new cameras And hes not wrong You get more zoom but are getting worse quality You dont get 7 lenses but cropping That 48MP is only doing one thingclogging your cloud storage faster Enjoy
Awesome stuff Please gift me the 15 pro 
"CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN WITH THE SUBTILES DOESNT MATCH THE VOICE 
"
"does it create portrait mode video even if the user is stupid and holds the phone vertical
that is my dream"
Captions are way off
"Hey the CCs are related to the MacBook Air not at all synchronized with what is said  Also the transcripts are like the CCs but not at all with what is said  All right so Apples Wonderlust event happened
It was pretty interesting
Honestly not that much stuff actually got announced
I mean we knew it was gonna be iPhone Apple Watch USBC
not that much other stuff
But it was more the stuff in between the lines
that was kind of interesting
and some other random stuff
that I dont thin"
"Its not just USB C its USB C from previous generation much slower speed

The iPhone 15 camera bump is visually ugly

No really iPhone 15 just added USB C which Android phones have been used for years IPhone 15 is twice as expensive just because Apple wants to price gauge

Stay away avoid"
11 mil views in 3 days This must be pushed by Apple or fake views
Camp getting one
Imagine you are getting a brand new and most advanced device in the world but it only comes with USBC 20 I know pro has 30 but come on Apple
iPhone Porsche design
Was an android user from 2009 until getting iphone14 my first apple product The reason I waited was because of the charge port not matching all my other devices I finally got sick of waiting and after buying four or five lightening cords less than a year later they get usbc  sometimes timing can be a youknowwhat
Subtitle is wrong lol
Subtitles are out of sync
Samsung S22 Ultra
I hate the power button I wish it could be customized Years I press it by mistake
USBC has been used by androids years ago Lol
My iPhone 8 still works perfectly fine Its pretty silly to keep buying a new phone every year
sad times for iphone
Apple only introduced usb c because eu told them so It looks the same as the past 3 iphones So little changes Unless iphone users really want usb c Then i really dont see the point in buying the 15
Just put a simCard slot on a some kind of cinematic camera Itd be iphone 1000 Pro Max
The biggest change is an absolute zero to the left for the grand majority of users that have a charging pad and dont need to physically connect their phone to their computer often I genuinely could not care less about this How about making Siri a competent assistant that can execute multistep directions now that would be a massive upgrade
While Im not impressed with the year over year updates I currently have an iPhone X its time to upgrade to a 15 Pro Max
"Youre video so much feel like directed by apple come one bro we all know apple think we are dumb No know usbc is use for charging data transfer atleast you dont say that 
I have to say youre review is not honest anymore and control by apple"
nothing change on the design since i11 but still all of us with a disposable money will buy it bs tbh
The subtle ridicule of the focal length 
One more year dissapointed I hope in near future theres something of innovation on iphones again they dont even dare doing those live showdowns as Jobs used to make since the hype is kinda meh
this is iphone 4c for me going to get that galaxy z fold for that money thanks
So does this mean my 2month old iPhone 14 Pro is now prematurely outdated 
lol classic apple move to restrict USBC functionality based on pricegrade of the phone
So what justifies me moving from iPhone XR
So nothing new since the Iphone 13
"Lol the double tap is not a sneaky new feature 
Its been there for better part of the year"
Everyone going on about fast charging it kills your battery Nothing wrong with 20w charging Wake up
Its unbelievably frustrating how they spoon feed apple users any significant upgrades Theyre LITERALLY 5 years or more behind Samsung and android when it comes to hard and software Apple hasnt INNOVATED ANYTHING since the first iPhone And its because apple users Im 3 years into owning an iPhone would buy it if they stepped backwards This is the most brainwashing company on the planet and its because the buyers are like children and fall for their new dumb words they use that dont mean shit and because of status
This is like two videos in one the CC tells another story
Wasnt there a new camera stabilization as well
Bro its the same damn phone since iphone 12 13 14 its garbage added 8 year usb type c wow soooo revolutionary smh
Potrait mode is a feature on my s10 5g from 5 years ago
Just shows he is the biggest iPhone fan not a very objective reviewer I would say
"Mute switch is a huge loss
First fingerprint unlock now this "
USB C  welcome to 2019 Apple users
"Video title Not Just USBC
119 but the Big Headline Feature Is Really  USB Now

If he had to use clickbait for a video thats how bad the upgrades are for the iPhone 15pro max You dont need to upgrade1200 if you own any iPhone above the 12 Pro Max People should stop buying iPhones and force them to make the phones exceptional next year Thats the only way there will be some innovation in the next iPhone Force them to elevate to the next level rather than doing these gimmick upgrades to release a phone every year Im sorry innovation died at Apple with Steve Jobs"
Any one else notice the subtitles are Wrong 
They will the fast charging to lightning
the faster you charge the more the battery degrades
Wonder if Apple will ever put an under screen fingerprint reader Either way huge pass this year again
I know most dont seem too wowed by the upgrade but since Im upgrading from my almost 5year old XR which is on its last leg I am ecstatic
Pass
You arent mentioning the base 15 having usb 20 which is basically the same as lightening You are just buttering apple and glorifying them Classic mksheep
Hasnt even got a fingerprint scanner
My 13pro is still going strong Just because of that Im not quite ready to upgrade until 16 and to be rid of my lightning cables 
Apple is stagnating as a company no real new major advancements decent tec but they have peak imho
A big annoyance from Apple is that the iPhone 15 Pro and Max only ships with a USB 20 compatible cord so you cant take advantage of the 10Mbs data transfer speed You are relegated to that same and much slower 480Mbs transfer speeds like the iPhone 15 The only USB 3 compatible cable that Apple sells is a Thunderbolt 4 USBC overkill for the iPhone 15 Pro for 69 A better deal is to get something on Amazon for around 30 from Anker etc I think Apple really blew its USBC implementation on this phone It would be nice to see the iPhone 16 support Thunderbolt 4 with significantly faster charging and 40Gbs data transfer speeds
I hope that the customizable button can be mapped to touch any part of the display thatd be pretty great for games
Its not just usb c its thunderbolt 4 usb c
"I have to upgrade just because the battery on my 13 pro is not holding like used to 

Verizon giving me 1000 credit if I do Thats nice"
Every phone same design 
Great video However it appears the closed captions that have been written are not accurate at all The autogenerated ones did ok but the official one seems to be from a different script Its still talking about Apple stuff just not using the words Marques is saying
I missed this years release completely and didnt even see any videos or remember it was that time of the year until I saw the Apple Ads Damn they really did switch to USB C I thought it would be wireless charging
Its tedious now Literally nothing published I understand they put lots of effort in making the new Vision Pro but iPhone is still the foundation for Apple and its really not good
But usb c is apples greatest innovation yet 
Same phone different day
If the cost of buying a minor upgraded phone dont kill you the radiation will
15 pro natural titanium or white titanium  Which one has similar titanium color with  the watch ultra titanium case color
Its not worth the money for the minimal changes and features UBSC sounds cool at the moment they are going to change again and Im willing to bet they are going to switch all products in the future to wireless charging a similar style to the iWatch and iPhone wireless charging platform USBC might be around but they may have a new trans medium device for data Im not sure how much faster its going to be but if you want to shave 10 seconds off from downloading your photos I dont see it as a major dealbreaker from here on out youre just upgrading the phone because its old or its broken
There is no real big changes other than the new charging port
iphone 15 are same as the 11 to 14 only difference is the USB C thats it nothing fancy and waist of money i still have the 12 pro max and still good as new
Iphones got the American community by the throat
YAWN 
New iPhone stuff Its the same phone can they come up with a new concept 
Im glad you stopped calling it IPhone 15 Plus like midway and started saying the actual name of it IPhone 15 Pro to not confuse people 
 wow  finally decides to place a USBC what half of all the androids have had 4 years ago Im not impressed plus I am an apple user will be switching over
The iPhone should have gone to USBC many years ago Wed still have Lightning if the EU hadnt forced Apple to change So I give props to the EU not Apple
I have an iPhone 11 so upgrading for me makes sense Ill see improvements all around
Sticking with my 14pro max Not much difference anyway 
Same shit
Apple should have used the dynamic island on the 14 series also instead of making it similar to the 13 series Its also good they introduced the dynamics island of the 15 series tho But then again they would have made innovative design on the rear camera instead of Stillmaking it look like the 13
Samsung has had that side button for years but glad to see it
Hyping up something that looks just like last years must be getting harder and harder for these jokers
You know Apple is struggling when the most exciting change on the new IPhone is they switched to USBC and added just a handful of features that android has had for years
Great reviewhowever most people really dont understand the data and how it benefits themmost people are concerned with battery life which sounds like its the sameunacceptableappreciate your workthumbs up
Good Video bro
Watching on my iPhone 14 pro 
Its just gonna have a slightly better camera then the last model I dont get the hype
This new pro max seems like its less phone than what we anticipate for the pixel 8pro The pro max is also more expensive apple as usual holding back Lame
can you buy me iphone14pro plss
The iPhone has not changed from the 12 pro which I have to this I think are doing little tweaks here and there but nothing ground breaking for a few years now I think we have come to a point of stalemate in technology devolvement and we are not in a simulation at all  we need Elon to buy iPhone and put a fucking rocket on the bottom of it
Is it just me The subtitles are completely irrelevant to what he is saying
i feel so sorry for youtube iphone reviewers who are trying so hard to say that sth is different on the more or less similar phone they come out most of the times 
Android didnt use USBC for the last couple years its been using it for 8 years
If you keep buying the new model they will always do whatever they want little upgrades each time Smart move from them dumb move from you I wont never understand why a person should trade his phone a 14 model to this one Being rich and wealthy doesnt mean you should gift them with your money
Excellent review i love it
iPhone 11 Pro here and no thank you all this new stuff is pretty much useless Titanium waste of money
I think its cheap that the USBC cable that comes with the 15 pro models is only USB 20 speed and not 30 or 32  So will have to buy seperate cable for that which ive done
TLDW So sjust USBCAndroid wins yet again
I really like the idea of the action button to open camera but I wonder if Im going to get 1000 photos of the inside of my pocket
"Im on a iPhone 11 Pro Max with ios 1541

Im going to upgrade and get the iPhone 15 Pro Max with ios 17 

Ill have so much to learn "
Afrika glodna i mao wody Ale uczy idiot ycia
to answer your question about fast charging is that so they can milk it for the next upcoming models LOLL you cant just release all the good stuff at once loll
Where you get that Apple Watch band and whats it called
Does anybody know where to find the wallpaper on the thumbnail
Same crap different name
Its a pathetic upgrade
Limiting usb c capabilities dependent on product price is so apple I cant believe people still fall for this bs
That was a great summary of the iPhone 15 Pro Max  I just purchased one and Im interested in learning all of the new features of this new upgrade
Excelente video Marques   solid  machines are these new iPhones  but camera lineup is still ugly reminds me an electric furnace Apple should make a change in my opinin take note of sleek design cues from different Android makers except those circular awful camera clusters in some devices
Galaxy is better they already have wireless charging for earbuds If you forget the charger for your buds you can charge them off the back of your phone wirelessly They also have fast charging It takes 30 mins to an hour to charge your phone And thats just with fast charging They also have super fast charging already Im sure thats a 20 to 30 min charge Yall keep letting Apple take your money because of simplicity Every year they come out with phones every six months and change one thing and yall go buy 
Damn no quick charging is a big L Maybe on iPhone 17 lol
Apparently COW FARTS is why we can no longer have nice things  is obsessed with ESG and frankly this is a VERY BAD SIGN  YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHAT WAS THERE TO LUST FOR  AT THE  WONDERLUST EVENT
Not worth it for me Thanks for sharing
these toys will never bring happiness permanently
Im so happy I left Apple I really am
Happy to move from 11 pro max to 15 pro max
AM WILLING TO SWITCH FROM MY ANDROID PHONE TO IPHONE 15 WHEN IT PRICE  TO 70   OF THE REAL PRICE
IPhone 15 is almost become as expensive as you buy a gold but in return gold value just increase and IPhone 15 price get devalue over the Following years 
Finally I got somewhere to comment on iPhone 15 phone 
Yes is just usb c
Wow this guy iPhone 15 video got more likes than apple official channel iPhone 15 video with more millions views than him
So the bottom line is nothing new except usbc
waste of money keep the 14
I wish they made Siri smarter
They need to add night vision to the camera to add something new to the iPhone
My iPhone 14 started to lag so bad ever since they started to announce the new iPhone is that normal
same old over priced over hyped outdated apple garbage
Am i the only one realizing iphone is trying to make their base phones more of a Mid range phones
man iphones are so damn ugly just get a samsung
This is the radiation device if you want to shorten your life
thank EU for the usbc 
Cant manufacture iphones or any phones for that matter without USBC cables in India
cool but dont care 
Ill stick with my iphone 12 pro max lol
ITS called 15 because everything from this phone is from 2015
Im holding out for the pocket watch version round screen on a chain Seriously these so called phones cannot fit in a pocket Just call them mini tablets Oh yeah and my current  year old mini tablet already has a USBC 50 mp camera metallic colored backing includes a stylus can still use regular headphone jack and cost under 200 My previous 450 iPhone SE couldnt even hold battery charge nor its home button together Just cuz it cost more dont make it better
Apple never releases everything cause they need to keep something for the next year Its a shame having USB 2 on the regular 15 and USB 3 on the pros
do the usb type c directly transfer data from pc to phone or still going for itunes and be the restricted apple unique one which is headache
The most exciting new feature is USBC a total joke Android phones use that from light years ago
Same thing as last year
Really dont like this android dressed as an iPhone
The new seems like the old
"No innovation at all
Apple is dead after Steve Job left this world

They have started giving features which Android already has"
I dont know when the last time you plugged your in was like every day Everything I do with my iPhone is through a plug Lol
pov you saw the tiktok of the guy finding marques brown filming the new iphone with some large azz camera
wow USBC finally welcome to 2013
Not as good as S23 Ultra
I got five of them 
I think Apple should allow more variety in terms of size  make a smaller pro phone that ppl can casually use that fits in palm of hand Still on the SE cause of size They shouldve given the mini some time to grow If it was the pro model ppl would def buy it
"Charging airpods with iPhones weak battery haha Funny Every apple user is a wallhugger
USB C  not a newest version I cannot understand how Apple users let this company cheat them all the time"
Are the subtitles completly wrong for some of you
My big concern with titanium is that it is extremely brittle compared to steel  steel bends titanium breaks apart or breaks off chunks Its a great way to save weight but I honestly think steel might be a better longterm material for every day phone usage
Wish there were more colors
USBC will be the new Law in Europe so nothing new here Looks like iPhone 121314
Ive never had a lightning port fail on a iPhone  The cable will fail before the port does  Not so with USB  All of my devices that have USB have all failed dont imagine USBC ports wont fail and when they do the device is ruined
The close captions on this video is so off its funny
Lingua braces 
Apple innovations are yawn
same  bs as last year no inovation
Everyone wow usbc awesome upgrade 
They trying to be just like Samsung
TypeC been around for so long nothing new iPhone running out of ideas
Another boring iPhone 
Omgusbc I cant wait to upgrade for another 1200usd Or sentence myself to three years bondage to a telecom provider
I love how yall Americans ignore the fact that the EU literally forced Apple by passing the new EU USB C lawbut yeah yall think what you want 
for the giv away not buyin anything will buyupgrade wen iPhone has 16 ram n usb C Thunderbolt speed  am I asking for too much apple would probably say yes 
Omg this is so interesting I mean this is gonna change SO MUCH of my life
Apple again welcomed to the current decade
outdated design that doesnt impress me at all the phones are too heavy too thick its time to replace the glass screens with something lighter and new light batteries no progress todaythe same style for many yearssick
put some spect on 30pin connectors name man
14 Pro Max user here nothing here really screams at me for wanting to upgrade Which I guess is a good thing cuz who wants to feel left out every year The next two models should give my 14 Pro Max enough time before it starts feeling old atleast
People are gonna be mad paying 100 for usb c port replacement every 3 months 
Disappointed about the 15  But love youre videos Thumbs up
honestly i have the 14pro max and im okay w the current fast charging speeds we have now anything faster seems unfathomable and like itll possibly cause overheating
Tbh idc Id probably get this its an upgrade from the 11 pro that Ive been having for almost 5 years now
THE ONE PIECE IS ON THE GLASS BACK  107
USB 20  released back in 2000 now featured on our brand new 2023 industry leading breathtaking phone And god forbid if you still use iPhone 14 what a peasant Stop get help get iPhone15
Im thinking for upcoming iPhones in coming years none specific changes this time typing from 14 pro max
First time in years Im not upgrading Nothing substantially new Its the same thing as iPhone pro 14 Plus you cant make it at least fast charging  Screw em Now I hope regulators break em on iMessage and rcs like they did w usbc Apple knows when that happens they will lose a lot of customers
"its not iPhone 15 is stuck in USB20 its Apple limits it on purpose
A16 at least would have the USB 31 5Gbps controller which A15 already has and is used on iPad mini6 The new USB controller for A17 pro is the USB3 10Gbps
Apple could have at least allow 5Gbps on A16 iPhone 15 but they didnt They limits it to USB20 480Mbps"
what is going on with the subtitles 
Bro the thing I wish for is to have enough money to buy it
Trash trash trashsame phone different port lol
Watching this on my iPhone 14 I got from my work yesterday 
Fix the english captions please the captions are from other video
Can we just get an I phone without a camera bump
203 baseline cheap ipad has had usbc since generation 10 which is the newest generation released 2 years ago i think
I use a Shure Video Mic to record all my youtube videos it has a lighting port because all of the previous phones used to have it and it is a FANTASTIC mic unless Shure comes out with a USB C microphone I wont get this new one Currently have the 14 Pro since I take lots of footage and photos on it So from what you mentioned it doesnt sound like Im going to switch
Typical apple stupidity throttling USB speeds unless you give them more money
How much do they pay the workers to build the phone Marquees
I think fast charging is overrated I sort of wish they made it possible to enable fast charging to preserve battery longevity but probably adds too much complexity to the charging circuit
"The 2023 iPhone 15 has left many scratching their heads with its design choice that seems to pay homage to the iPhones of the past Its a case of dj vu when you lay eyes on it as it looks almost identical to its predecessors But theres one unmistakable change thats got everyone talking  the longawaited inclusion of USBC

Apple has finally waved goodbye to its proprietary Lightning port and joined the USBC club This shift is undoubtedly a step in the right direction as it promises faster data transfer speeds and compatibility with a wide range of accessories and chargers aligning the iPhone with the industry standard

However whats raised a few eyebrows is the absence of a camera worthy of the year 2023 In a world where smartphone cameras have become powerful tools for both photography and videography the iPhone 15 offers a 48megapixel camera leaving many to wonder why it falls short of the competition which boasts cameras with 50 100 or even 200 megapixels

For those loyal to the Apple ecosystem the USBC transition might be reason enough to upgrade to the iPhone 15 Still its hard to ignore the feeling that Apple could have done more to innovate especially when it comes to the camera technology In a rapidly evolving tech landscape the iPhone 15s design choices might leave some fans wanting more"
i am in camp cant afford these so i will pretend to not care
People still buy iPhones  Worst shit phones ever Samsung is the way to go
Interesting how Apple doesnt give one basic feature in other iPhones and keep it in pro and charges high for the product
Im defiently thinking about getting one of these Id just wish they would bring back the sim card tray I know it wont happen but still
Apple fanboys sure love wasting a lot of money on stuff that has no real quality of life changes because its got an apple on it
You should go to LEAP 2024 in March
Its good to know that the EU is soon banning all phones that dont have USBC charging Its probably a really big reason for Apple to change from lightning to USBC and not really for its features like fast charging They might introduce that later tho hopefully
Good to see that the world is coming together on at least USBC lol
So its the same just a little faster
How funny is it that Marques invented his craft at age 15 Thats one iphone for each year to date You literally cant catch him unless you started at the same age All these 30 and 40 year old people doing it like its a good look Word to the wise Its not a good look Its like going back to high school and trying to be the cool kid in the 9th grade Not a good look
Its funny how the most impressive thing this IPhone has is USBC You cant make this shit up
Still with 13 pro max  great phone
Still no live wallpaper or led notification lights  I miss HTC Evo 
600 Yeah but they still have iphone 16 and 17 to release so
mute switch is pretty iconic lol
anker makes great stuff
I am using 11 since 2020 and I think moving to 15 would be good choice for me
"First saw the Action button on a DTEK50 Also the Swipe Up effect is from the Q5
Just thought this was an interesting coincidence"
So all the guys doing why iphone charging port is superior are jobless now
Can we please make the phone thicker with a bigger battery and get rid of the camera bump
Apple should accept to themselves that they are not generating anything new or innovative in smartphone industry Its stagnant now
This is sadly boring
"one question  non pro models which have USB 20  
do they have MHL support 
 because android phones which have USB 20 they dont support MHL support "
please fix the captions they are completely wrong
My anker chargers always break
"im upgrading from 11 pro max so yeah its more than usb c to me

bezels
magsafe
dynamic island
chips
camera
storage
and yeah then usb c"
Greatso now it has what Xiaomi already had with the Redmi Note8
Apple doesnt really care about charging speeds  their entire thing is the phone will last the full day
"The new innovation is type C cable and new high price
The dumb apple audience"
Bringing out phones every year is bad for environment
As an android user Im so used to 30 min full charge for the last 3 years  so surprise to hear that the latest iphone is on 20w charge
gaming features for me is the best Cant wait to test  RE8 and solidify expectations for the next switch with dlss and raytracing features
The Subtitles is for a different video 
USB C is a connector  not a standard  companies can wire them up whatever way they want
He used the word same like 3000 times
Iphone is very bad with combacks
Im camp upgrade Trading in my 12 Pro Max for the 15 Pro Max Yay
Am I taking crazy pills or does it look like the captions are from a completely different video
Dude its a port How is this Crazy 
High charging speed is mostly unnecessary for iphones as they now hold power too long unlike many others Also higher charge rates put more strain on the battery which can potentially impact its overall lifespan and performance
mind you that the change to usb c was actually forced because of europes lawsuit if that wasnt the case then there would be one less thing that apple would of changed from the iphone
Mate you know its not worth it but we get itits your job
The portrait mode thing I have seen already in one of the Lumias  Id like to say the Lumia 1520 but not sure
To me the iPhone hasnt been innovative since the release of iOS 7 and the iPhone 6 I dont even bother to watch the keynotes anymore or upgrade unless I absolutely have to
cool beans
Im still rocking the old iPhone 11 Pro in beautiful forest green I wanted to upgrade this year but I prefer the smaller 61 pro design to the larger Pro Max and I therefore hardly see a reason If they had squeezed the periscope 5x camera into the regular 15 pro they would have sold it to me As it stands Ill just pay Apple for a new battery and wait to see if they squeeze a periscope into the regular Pro in 2024 Somethings telling me they will
Mostly wanting to see if I should get out of the 14pro max or just wait until next year
Is the same as iPhone 14 hahahahaha
They had to switch to USBC Its the law thats make every electronic device to have usbc from 2024 at least here in EU
"Not just USB C
Feels like youtubers r having a hard time to justify a new version"
Kind of disappointing that apple was forced to do it I mean they should have been allowed to come up with something new or a different product Differentiation is important I mean Id like to see lots of different types techs not just one type of thing everywhere
Im finally upgrading from an SE 1st gen
why subtitles is not matching with the sound
USBC Welcome to 5 years ago 
no it is just usb C other than that theres nothing new from these scampple
Am so done with these useless iphones with no new major upgrades and mkbhd stop doing paid advertisements
As a 14 pro user it wont make sense to update this year 
I had Iphones in the past but switched to Samsung Galaxy Never looked back
The titan is nothing special as there are watches in titan frame for a very long time
hey marquees brownly the iphone 15 pro max is the 39nth iphone ever there has been more than 23 iphones
Wolt kod M4WT9RC  za 2x8 i besplatnu dostavu Dobar tek
typical apple those scumbags
If all the benefits came to all the phones they would only have two phones
brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrruh
I preordered
"Same Garbage 

thinking hard about new features"
the question i have is  what if we use vivo 120v charger is it gonna charge that faster also is gonna damage battery health also 
Im that type of user who cared more about the new chip than the USBC To be honest I bought all iPhones from 5S to 14 Pro Max and Ive never used the cable to do something different from charging the phone If I need to transfer stuff thats basically why cloud services exist
Yea its basically the same damn phone
With all respect to your work but the only man who still speak facts about tech is that one man in unboxing therapy
a late 2023 flagship with a 60hz display cmon
watching on my iPhone Xs Ordered a black titanium iPhone 15 Pro with 1T storage
Bro give me i phone one plzz
imma keep my 14 pro not worth upgrade
Upgrading from an Iphone 8 so yeah its nice ive been hoping that they would include usb c this year and we got it
Is anyone confused by the subtitles
"I think someone pasted in the wrong Closed Captions The look to be talking about a MacBook so far  Or maybe somehow off by about two minutes 
Thanks for all that you do"
Only having USB 20 speed on a 1000 smartphone is shocking The 15s have 48mp and 2x telephoto Really sucks Not keen on the colours either Meh
How fucking how is the biggest company in the world a company that can be sloganed down to a bit of improvement but mostly catching up
still trash i see
I dont get why they just wouldnt make the whole iPhone titanium
USB 20 in a brand new Apple product in 2023  cant afford the Pro models sucks for you
Im not getting another phone until they bring back the mini
Bro you cant fake it anymore stop the
Do you know any iPhones that r good for teenagers Marques Im trying to decide which  iPhone 1115 would be the best to buy
we need an iPhone that has a radiation which kills cancer cells and cures eye sight That would be a huge achievement LOL
so me having a 12 pro max should i just get a 14 pro max
Please gift me this
They are all out of ideas without Steve
Action button feature is there on cheapest samsung5g phone f14 in India for just 90 I can open any app or assign a function Lol 
Usb 20 amazing
None of that is enough to make me go to a dogshit apple phone but that programmable button sounds sick
Heads up the Subtitles may not match the video They may have been for an old edit
What if i use my 64 watts android charger Would it make difference
I think the A17 Pro having the USB chip in it will result in the next iPhone basemodels to have an A17 non Pro without the USB chip keeping them usb 20 speeds
Apple When are you adding a fingerprint reader to your smartphones I have been waiting for years
I just wish they had a pink 15 pro 
Im so excited that they added the sun C port lightning is trash And we can use everyones charger now
This is the dumbest iPhone release ever or yet I guess if you have the 11 or under might make sense yes But me 12 Pro Max I was really looking forward for this release and oh well Ill wait another year
Hey mate theres something wrong with subtitle
Spending on welcomed stuff is not hype and more like a downer  Not hating on the reviewer I know that Apple sleeps on products and just wants cash
We are at the point where it is almost embarrassing to admit to having the newest Iphone
Wattage though
Theyll come next year or the year after and say 30WATTS FAST CHARGING  INNNOOOVATTTIOONN
The new iPhone15
Can i play clash of clans
23rd iPhone Can someone explain this
Is there anyone whos asking why apple didnt released the Product Red iPhone 15 Or its only me
So its just  UBSC
The interchange of pro and plus even on the Apple site and the video event is pretty annoying for some reason
Im pretty sure Apple has had more than 2 connectors wasnt there 2 versions of the 30 pin
it weighs less phone will b stronger even if it wasnt titanium
This upgrade sucks 
This company tries so hard to be fun
LMAO the fact that they didnt go thunderbolt is such a money grab gotta save improvements for the next gen ill get the 16 so lame
Literally no reason to upgrade if you have a 121314
What a waste of money lmao
Thank you EU legislators Go Regulation
Not impressed holding on to my phones much longer
Is it just me or do the closed captions not match what Marques is saying in the video
No change no point
Def not worth the upgrade I will keep my Iphone 14 pro Apple needs to step up their game  Everything in my house runs off of lightening cables so I am the only one with usbc that will be annoying too They are just throwing post edit tech into the camera not actually improving it Fake Bokeh  Nobody gives a crap about colors we all put cases over them They should drop super slim magnetic batteries or make phones thicker for battery life That bright screen will just kill battery life even quicker
Closed Captioning on this video is really messed up
The more things change the more they stay the same
The blue titanium color is 
Total let down
Apple running out of gas I give it two years max
"The best thing I love about APPLE is that the products are part of each other 
Which make its harmony so unique 
I appreciate this greatly "
no
The iPads already have the usb type c
"This is insane
After Steve they just making business with people
To be honest Id say since iPhone 10 on there hasnt been cutting edge changes to convince me to upgrade
In 2023 introducing usbc isnt a big deal especially when we all know why they did it 
refreshing rate for basic models still isnt 120 Htz 
Dynamic island is new way to keep that disturbing notch instead of removing it
I wait for iPhone 16 or 17 or anytime they decide to finally do a real improvement"
Incredible video Thank you SO much
Until Apple creates a Foldable  Im done with the iPhone  The Z Fold 5 I just got is far better than the iPhone 15 Pro Max
Ill just wait for the iPhone 20maybe it will be better then my iphone 14 pro
Apple could possibly be the best android
Weve always been able to use the lightning cable to charge the Airpods from the iPhone Thats not new Apple finally told people about it but thats been a feature for years
iPhone turning android
What do you think about the new adaptive sound option and conversation awareness
All Apple did was leave everyone wondering why the only changes are the  USBC and Titanium frame
Or you could get android and be 4 years ahead
Being on the iPhone XS Max Im basically forced to upgrade now that my firmware is bugged down so hard It was good while it lasted
Totally gonna get the promax model
Meh I still hate the operation of iPhones
"So its the same phone same features same tech 
 You are just getting tech that everyone else has had for five plus years but still no fast charging 
I really cant believe fast charging has not been added its the best feature of usb c  
"
My android side button has three different toggle settings for long press double and quick press Ya and usb c gen 3x2 with fast charging as fast as 30 minutes Iphones are still no where near as good as flagship androids Oh ya and i can charge my headphones wirelessly with my phone or my friends phone And Android wants their phones to work with Iphone unlike Apple who likes to make it harder for iphone users to work with Android Still a shit company
This guy clearly has a conflict of interest
i remember having usb c on my galaxy s8 in 2017
iPhones are slowly become trash
the action button on the side  woah  thats new and very helpful  lol
Hate appleThe technology will put apple down soon
Apples new idea is on carbon neutrality Really whom Apple is trying to fool in So carbon neutrality is a new buzz word which they want to throw in Apple is a technological company which is bringing small features which all other phone makers have already done decades ago I though respect apples for some really cool innovations which they have done in the past but not this year Congrats to Apple for their new product and best of luck even for their sales Peace
Why the 15 Pro Max dont have a redpink or some other vibrant color I just dont understand why the other lines always have prettier colors than the Pro Max lines I only buy the Pro Max IPhones
Its pretty shitty of Apple to have USB at 23 And its kind of baffling
Love the 15 in pink I can finally get an upgrade from my iPhone 11  Super excited
when he said the new colors are black and white and this new blue which is subtle i mean really how could someone say these are new colors
Cable quality is poor I dont accept this from apple
Thx marquess for another great video
remember 15 years ago when new phones were actually different wont be upgrading got the 14
Im only upgrading when some groundbreaking change is made that actually makes sense or when I break my phone The usb C was literally apples were changing something to force you to buy new accessories move That programmable mute button kinda cool but not worth upgrading my phone It will be nice when people stop blindly upgrading their phones so apple will be forced to do something thats innovative
60hz oof
USBc why Same reason  removed the minijack  because of COURAGE
So what im getting from this its the same phone 
Same phone wow so innovative
Hello Marques your iPhone 1515 Pro Impressions Not Just USBC video is showing captions of your iPhone 15 Event Reactions Sneaky Updates video I checked it manier times thinking it was only happening with me but got the same results I dont have any problem with it I just thought to let you know
I didnt watch thw whole video But I love how unimpressed u are with the new iPhone Hopefully people see how basically each new iphone is a money grab
"Apple has signed up to make all apple products to be repairable by the owner or corner shop by 2027 PLease could you critically ask how this phone has been redesigned to reach this goal 

Another Apple cloak and mirriors "
s23 is still better 
Summary You dont need an iPhone 15 if you already have a 12 Pro or higher phone
only innovation they do is downgrade their previous model  so everyone will buy new one
Upgrading from an iPhone 13 mini to the 15 pro since I havent been having it with the battery life  I hope its worth it so sad they discontinued the minis but also if they had better battery life I wouldve kept my 13 mini cause I love it
Dear Apple fans In order for Apple to actually start making real changes to their phones your going to have to stop purchasing them This is getting out of hand 
Is it me or the captions are doing their own thing
Time to save up for pc guys
"We dont need IP Rating
Please use High Refresh Rate on Base Models"
Bro it looks the same as any other iphone
iPhone 7 is still okay
Im always an Android Lover but moving to US has forced me to use IPhone and I still dont like it 
I still have the 12 pro should I be upgrading
Yea no this one isnt worth it its like switching all your cords for nothing tbh I really hope this doesnt drive to much demand this product seems dumb Tbh Apple has to understand that the customer doesnt want to lose things otherwise there wont be a reason to switch As a consumer if I have to pay more and more and keep losing features of my phone they can keep that DEVICE
I remember every year Apple would blow US away with the A different design and new innovation Its been the same product for years now Wanna know how I know that They need YouTube influencers to tell us otherwise in order to push the product I remember when the product sold itself
People dont understand this one thing if Apple gives all features in current model then what is to offer in next year model No fasting charging this year Well there will be next year
IPhones are the most backwards flagship smartphones in the market
I will never buy a regular sized iPhone again battery life is awful it makes me want to switch to Samsung
A big welcome to iPhone to USBC with its usual 6 years delay Same as LED displays
iPhone 15 Aint impressive
Why are the subtitles like this 
With this price i csn build super high gaming pc 
When my 10s stopped working I got the 14 after 5 years USBC would help a lot with my back ups since I have 120GB on my phone Kind of makes me feel better knowing the 15 isnt really USBC because the chip Im not buying a pro or pro max Not worth the money Hopefully they figure it out by the time the iPhone 19 or 20 comes out and I get a new phone
I upgraded to an Android years ago and have been watching Apple try to catch up ever since
I was waiting for a major upgrade but looks like 23 ultra is still a better option
Is it actually
Overall its not worth it I would wait until 16
Lol so what do I do with my 5 lightning chargers now
Im still on 12ProMax 
Junk s23 ultra is better
"the new camera looks fucking dope
idc man Im an apple fanboy at this point
they make good shit"
Is the subtitle match the video
this new iphone over s23 ultra i will go with iphone i mean both dont have expandable anyways but iphones got better sound quality eversince and video true video not tiktok enhanced video quality and for the price iphone wins still hate both phones have those back camera that looks want to go out and leave the phone poking out why not flat back its like reminding me my past when i use to have coins in my pocket or candies or keys annoying fellings just me personal view even camera has those issues why my concern is that because lenses of camera cost more same with the phones now how bout you i mean samsung is still bad on lcd repair it ghosted and iphone before on home button now iphone on wireless and camera i mean thers a lot but i go to iphone 15 pro ove s23 ultra
Ill stick with my 13 pro
I think fast charging kills the overall battery life No proof and forums and devs will tell you differently but I dont believe them and I think thats why they didnt put it in 
When this is the only YouTuber that hits literally everysinglepoints of what youre curious about on the iPhone 15s and ends in exactly the same two boats of which side you could be inyour head
The best Apple upgrade was because they were forced to add usbc
This is joke Wait for next version next year which should already have easily replacable battery
Keeping my 13 pro max No worthy upgrades at all At all
Android works better
First year Ive actually wanted to get the pro max
Very interesting to see the brand ambassador of apple making a review video Not just leaned towards their products but he suck it of like a champ Dude even feared to say they copied year old features of android phone like portrait adjustments  So sad
In Europe they REDUCED the prices of the whole iPhone 15 family from last year
first time watching a marques video even though ive known abt him for years and i totally see why hes on top i was literally hooked for 13 min even though im not that interested in iphones in general
Closed captions trippin 
What a waist apple need to pick their game up and actually bring worthwhile upgradeslooks to the iPhone I have the 14pro max and this will be the first time I wont bother to upgrade
Is it me But that portrait mode effect Hasnt that been around on xiaomi and samsung phones already Maybe the quality of adjustment is what it comes down to
IPhone 15 pro is features most powerful than IPhone 15 And other Phones IPhone 15 is money saver but features low than IPhone 15 pro
iPhone users finally gonna be happy to use some 5 years old android features D
Sooo In short its all the same
The subtitles are weird 
Been holding onto the 12 PM so I ordered the 15 PM because I was definitely due for an upgrade
First time on your channel Good job kiddo
"Seems like the last few iPhone are all very similar  For me its all about the trade in value of my phone
We all know if you dont trade in regularly youre just not going to get much for your old device We all upgrade eventually so Ill be trading in my 13 Pro Max"
"should i get pro or pro max 
i currently have a iphone 11"
Apple Announcement  The art of making big announcement without announcing anything much
Need USB C Airpod Max now
I might be getting one but the pro is so expensive in Canada 
Not a big enough update I mightve upgraded if the pro offered the same camera as the pro max
im not paying 2000 for a phone with lousy battery life
high rsdiation
And still no update for the keyboard iPhone only phone that we have to tap the 123 
"I never in my life even touched any Apple product i hear they are amazing however i met someone that years ago told me that they will adapt to others well he was right we see already that the USBC  shows up in the new phone
I do not have anything against Apple i have a reason why i do not use them Great product"
Everybody switch on the subtitles for a differentparallel review
Ill bet they are just gonna stretch the USBC abilities out for the next couple phones Fast charging then thunderbolt by IPhone 17 lol We all know they could have just done it but iPhone every year puts them in this position
Wish they would of done a 15mini
Wrong subtitles
Your subtitles arent synched to the content Just thought youd want to know
I have a 13 pro max but Im genuinely considering upgrading Better battery again better camera smoother YuGiOh play and one less cable to carry around are definitely positives
Time to sell my kidney
Physically the lightning connector is better IMO The male cable side is more durable in that it is not a concave connector like USB C that stuff can get lodged in The female port is better on lightning again physically in that it is less complicated without the protruding interior chip inside the port I understand standardization but I really liked lightning compared to USB especially when compared to the terrible micro USB back in the day Not sure if it is as capable from a data transport perspective but physically it is a more elegant  and robust connector
"the pink one looks cute
im considering it"
Remember this revolutionary usb 30 that the galaxy note 3 from 2013 TEN years ago had Now you can get this finally in a 1500  Iphone Happy times
Wow its the same as my 12
Honestly Im leaving apple for google
"I have a iphone 7 plus still Cracked screen and the inside of the screen is getting more fucked now Everyone always says
You need a new phone dude
So its time"
Expensive pieces of crap that are worth half of their price at most as usual But hey snobism works
best thing about apple dont care about future upgrades they will be so minimal you will hardly feel a loss You buy one it last long time hopefully then after 3 years plus you might buy a new iphone with 3 new better features
Camp dont care its iPhone tryina play with android lol its kinda pathetic how weak the USB c port is
48 MP chip Slow down Marques haha 
is it Worth it Marques 
Sticking to my Samsung
Very very american video Stay brainwashed everyone Mean while we have every other country getting bunkers ready for civilians But in america we worried about a phone Good luck zombiesm
The ONLY reason Apple changed its charging to USBC is because a new EU law is enforcing
Ill wait until Apple bring usb4 thunderbolt 4 speeds to my iPhone Im good with my 13 pro for now Guess Ill have to wait at least two years before they do it 
Still 3 years behind android flagships  Im using Huawei mate x3  this phone looks like a piece of tech from 2018
All the new updates seem so random New usb c port but you get no updated charge or speed with the base model just release one phone with significant upgrades These 3 model bs is so annoying
Titanium has higher tensile strength For the purpose of smart phones the stainless steel would be stronger but heavier The advantage of the titanium is weight
5x zoom only
Currently using 13 promax so far 14  15 not worth to upgrade
Im dissapointed that the 15 still has no AOD
The blurring effect later when you forget to put your phone on portrait has been around for 5 years already with midrange Samsung phones like the A series 
great info
Is it worth upgrading from my iPhone 13 Pro
"Refresh rate display  
Honor 50  400 120hz  
Poco F5  380  120hz
Samsung Galaxy A54  324  120hz
Motorola Edge 30 Neo  269  120hz
Motorola Moto G72  179  120hz

IPHONE 15 2023  800  refresh rate 65 hz
REALLY "
Imagine apple calling usbc a feature xD
Come on be real its basically the same phone
Radiation a major problem with this phone  Has disclaimer that it will cause birth defects
Hey I started watching the video and noticed the Subtitles are wrong My settings could be the issue but I believe they are the wrong subtitles because the whole beginning of the video is only about MacBooks
the subtitles are melting my brain as if for a different video with the same subject
Im sorry but they promised a revolution and stil the same for 98
I will wait for the 16 pro max I have the 14 pro max I dont see it being worth upgrading slight little upgrades but either great review
Government regulated all charging ports need to be the same They passed a law my boy You welcome Stay woke
Everybody is becoming an apple fanboy
"I recommend purchasing the Pro model as I suspect that the upcoming advanced spatial photography features will require a LiDAR sensor which is only available on Apples Pro series
"
Wauw what an innovative product and brand It looks like nothing i ever saw before lets spend another 1200 dollar garbage 
The blue is the dopest
IPhone Alway king Of Smart  Phone
Screw Apple
I preordered an iphone 15 pro max  even i think it doesnt deserve to upgrade from my iphone 14 pro max  The point is that i dont see good features in the new iphone  Just did it to have the last version of the iphone no more 
No innovation at all very bad update Stop hyping this phone
Nah after so many years on iPhone I finally switches to Android S23 and I probably wont go back
USB20 over USBC is such an FU That is such an indication of weve reused the same soc as the 14 and couldnt even be bothered to add in the USB3 controller  Theyre definitely butt hurt about bring forced into USBC
This guy is paid a lot by Apple to brag
Its the same copied and paste phone from the past lol
Real quick coming from an iPhone pro max user since the pro max introduced I downgraded to an iPhone Mini 13 and absolutely love it Every one at work wants to get the Mini now Ive had more compliments then ever with my Mini than I ever had with my Maxs Apple needs to get the Mini back online People are tired of carrying bricks around
Your voice Is it text to speech Testing AI
same iphone every year just with usb c
Apple lacks vision iphone was a camera phone and still it is which is to be bought for camera specially for videos and which additionally does have calling and texting feature as well along with that it allows users to use applications created for Apple separately  mainly nowadays applications run based on internet  if speed is good it will load faster Whereas multi tasking pinch zoom in out pop out applications and many other features such as two apps at same time  could have been added to make this phone good for productivity but Apple doesnt want to do its just encashing two segments 1 rich elite section and 2 those who doesnt need doesnt have moneh but want to show off  3 this section is the real use of iphone who buts because they like something in iphone that feature is must for them or they want to be in the ecosystem of Apple so they buy it to maintaining smoothness in their respective work
I have the 13 Pro Max and at this point Ill just wait for the 20 Pro Max LOL
"If there was anytime in history a real reason to hate on Apple then it is the USBC on their devices
Instead of complying to the demands of the EU so the planet produces less trash they used their lawyers to find and abuse a loop hole 
This inhumane monopolistic cartell company needs to die off the planetquickly"
Just USBC
"Not much of difference minor updates upgrades on new i phone 15 Nothing exciting 

Lol I see how foolish people can be and crazy about new iPhone 15 and bleeding money on this most worthless features 

USB c was an upgrade Really Lol"
I wonder if the 15 also has got the option of defaulting the camera lens to 12x and 15x It would make sense to upgrade to 15 from 14 for that single new feature for me personally
Why are the subtitles talking about the apple watch
L anker eufy
Apple is a monopoly and its an antiAmerican company like Tesla China and Russia are enemies
They only added USBC because EU told them they would not be allowed to sell products in the EU from January 2024 unless all devices have USBC
we dont care iphone is crap
So basically were getting an iPhone 14 with usb c 
Zero Innovation Company in 2023
Only change is because they didnt have a choice
Im watching this on my 5s
"Do you know why I still have a Samsung S10 Android 
Because of the storage 512 GB and a SDCard insert of 512 GB makes around 1TB quiet a difference with the IPhone pro 15 max max 256 GB
My model has also still a jack 35 mm input to connect also with a classic amplifier Accuphase without distortion or fall off of Bluetooth systems with likely hack possibilities
And an avant la lettre IPhone 15 USBC Connection "
pretty much zero upgrade from iphone 14
UsbC Welcome to 2018 IPhone
Camp dont care at all No mini no buy
Ill hold on to this 14promax for 3 years until I see an iphone w fast charging feats
"So no USBC PDQC support You can tell that they were kind of forced into USBC by Europe and didnt have time to make it fully compliant to the latest standards By the way I wonder if you can replace Lightning connectors with USBC ones like you can for USBA as shown on many YouTube videos for laptops or expensive devices such as phone addon infrared cameras Or maybe Apples strategy lies on wireless charging

But rather than the phones its really the progress made on the Extreme Ultra Violet lithography technology that amazes me The first EUV chips were used on the iPhone 13 7nm then the iPhone 14 5nm and now the iPhone 15 chip engraved at 3 nanometers at least for the high end Pro models At this rate ASML should breach the 1nm barrier within a few years and the iPhone 16 or 17 might get it as well as full USBC and satellite phone like Huawei claim they have but consumers claim it does not work"
Same no close all tab for the apps
Is it easy to be hacked 
"I didnt get what you mean by lack of fast charging I have fast charging on my 13 mini with Anker power supply I think it is probably possible to fast charge with the right power supply and a usbc cable to iPhone 15 
For me I think its a downgrade to swap the lightning port considering how easy it is to service these ports compared to USBC USBC ports tend to be the first thing to break down with normal usage followed by screen and batteries Not to mention that USBC specifications for power supplies are not always followed Be careful now with charging your phone with sketchy phone chargers"
Yeah its the same thing as iPhone 14 pro just renamed and has some futures no one is gonna use
Is the convert regular photo to portrait thing only for iPhone 15s and above or is there going to be a software update for the older models though
Few notches here and there but nothing that great
Im still happy with my iPhone 13 alpine green
Im waiting for 16pro
I will be upgrading from my 12pro max 
Still better than any android 
just usb c
Ive got Oxygen here in 2023 To use everyday to breathe
Same old stuff with apple they are late in so many things its like theyre not falling the competition and new technologies
I phones are just boring compared to some Android phones I made the switch to a Z fold 4 and have never looked back
Subtitles are asynchroised
Captions and the Video are miss matched and its fun to read it 
Literally the same shit
Someone somewhere is butthurt that the Lightning charger is gone
Blah blah product nothing new and over priced where is the innovation and imagination
So basically is copy and paste
"How are you feeling todayi have something for you 
Lets talk about it "
Camp dont care Wont upgrade to another iPhone until apple gets rid of the bezels the notch incorporates a new design and maybe brings back Touch ID
 apples drama
Hi does it come with a SIM card The 14 used an eSIM
Is just the phone I used 12  is same like 15 just phone
Subtitles are wrong  from different video
The moment they had to mention YouTubes name to promote their flagships i knew they had nothing to announce
Anchor is kinda effed right now finally apple users wont have to buy apple specific peripheralls
"Back in the day I would upgrade to every new model because the jumps in performance and features was worth the wallet hit I stopped when I purchased the iPhone X I slowed down I waited out for the iPhone 13 Pro Max and thats what Im still using The 11 and 12 was not with it 

I have definitely found in recent years Im barely on my iPhone I only play one game Egg Inc when I have downtime I rarely take pictures I literally use it for music sat Nav YouTube and podcasts 

So obviously when a new model comes out with barely any change no dramatic style change or features I honestly dont see how the new model could be justified 

Im not a fan of the USBC is a weak socket the amount of issues Ive experienced with it I think Apple should have gone wireless charge entirely or stuck to their guns on lightening bolt"
Stone age technology bs
Literally the 14 pro max
Heres a questionso who in 2023 actually cares about new phones now  
Worthless Wont be buying After buying literally every iphone till date
Where can i find the wallpaper on the thumbnail
"Apple puppies gettogether
And biggest puppies of Tim Cook is MKBDH"
So just a USBC Thank you for nothing
Nice video we want the wallpaper please 
someone messed up and put the wrong subtitlescaptions for this video Completely unrelated subtitles on this video Fix it 
gives me a perfect reason to ditch samsung
100 recycled phone should cost 500 bucks 
hate the camera lens look
Nice sub title
What could do they not limit usb c speeds not put a ridiculous 60hz on non pros add multi tasking on the max atleast improve charging speeds
USBC in a phone What will they think of next
Last year the big deal was the dynamic island for the iphone 14 now this year its the USBC on the iphone 15 I still have the iphone 13 pro max and Im happy with that still Im not about to drop 1200 on the same phone with a different charger port apple needs to step up there game I know people will still buy these phones but its honestly not even worth it not much has changed at all they shouldnt have even released an iphone 15 if this is all they have to offer What a joke
"iPhone 15 pro max Okay but nobody talks about the sound but if this device is play device then you have to talk about the sound How is the sound
Best wishes"
GarbagePhone 
Now remove the cutoutnotch and add 60W charging
Apple never fail to disappoint at those events
My wife and I have old iPhone Xs Max phones and are looking to upgrade  My question is is the 15 significantly better than the 14  Other than the USB change and double tap what would we be missing going with a less expensive 14
USB 20 speeds not fast charg HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
"Apple is a religion 
For lazy nad rich people Or just for lazy people buying 4 years phones with a loan"
This is absolutely ridiculous 
how fake is his video getting saying pro is noticeably lighter they are only 1g lighter
I have an iphone 12 pro thinking of moving to iphone 15 and your right what for usbc seriously Feels like Apple is just not trying very hard for the last few years resting on laurels
interesting to see such a brand reinventing stuff and marketing it as new when will the fan club wake up
60hz for base still 
As apple repair technician lightning ports were much more durable and easier to fix rather than replace
6090120 hz display
dumb same phone just two things different probably 3
Fast charging  My phone chargers from 15 to 80 in 15 mins and I have a 13 pro max
The captions are incorrect
USB C wow What a change  Its amazing Oh oh dont forget it has ROUND Edges Wow   iPhone buyers are suckers  They will buy  if its got apple  logo on it
He sounds so disappointed
Maintaining the same design for many years is essential to prevent older generations from appearing outdated due to frequent updates
Literally why tf do people still buy Iphones
Apple didnt choose to pick USBc The EU made them change to USBc
My 6s plus looks hotter
Actually I think the upgrades on the phone sound boring af apple disappoints  only good change is USB c but they were forced to
"IMO they will add the regular A17 Chip in iPhone 16 without the fast USB 3 controller  just call it A17 
Thats why they named the chip as A17 pro this year further increasing the differentiation between both models "
 action buttonwith Google you just have to tap the back of your phone twice to do what you want
hi could you please review the new Huawei Mate 60 Pro with Harmony OS thanks
what are the subtitles 
USB C its going to be iDroid 
Another year of waiting Will keep my pro max 13 until the upgrade is worthy
But the pink is tempting 
Next years gonna be s banger
How is it convenient having glass in the from and in the back Whats next Glass frame Glass chassis
Were not buying 
no fast charging is such a dealbreaker for me damn
So this is what the big camera was filming
I still use the IPhone6 lol and I just preorder 15Pro So excited for cameraphoto update Im about to experience
The sub is off hes saying one thing and the sub is saying another
Apples Wonderlust event focused on the announcement of new products including the iPhone 15 and Apple Watch Series 9 The event also highlighted the environmental initiatives undertaken by Apple The new iPhones feature updated designs improved processors and enhanced camera capabilities The Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 have undergone significant improvements in terms of processing power and display brightness Additionally a new double tap gesture has been introduced for the Apple Watch allowing for quick interactions with the device A subtle update to the AirPods Pro 2 enables lossless audio with low latency when used with Apple Vision Pro Apple also emphasized its commitment to carbon neutrality and outlined its efforts to reduce its environmental impact While some may question the motives behind Apples environmental initiatives the progress made in using recycled materials and sustainable energy sources is commendable Overall the Wonderlust event showcased Apples latest products and its dedication to environmental sustainability
iPhone boringi am happy with my google
Never understood the difference from X to 15
iPhone 15 and 2 cameras  NOPE
pov  you never owned an iphone
I dont gaf about YouTube but bro you smashed 10milly in 3 days on a phone video thats brazy Congratulations man
damn mk is getting old
This is NOT iPhone 15
Cant wait for iphones with replaceable batteries
dont put more white washing on this bruh this is jus a crappie old version having some fancy things except c charger
apple cords are finally dead
I really wonder what Apple would be if Steve Jobs would be still around
WOW USB 20 That died 23 years ago Apple is always so far behind
Removable battery
Its lame that the biggest deal about the new iPhone is a charging port Yeah its a whole new game for Apple but damn thats it I dont even plug my phone in I use wireless charging 
Im on an 8 which is discontinued from updating this year so was going to go for the new standard 15 yet  after seeing this Ill probably wait till 16 i have a iPad MacBook and Studio so tend to upgrade each as a leap is made and it doesnt look like a leap hence Ill probably wait  i kept my 8 due to size im a motorcycle nutter the smaller form factor is just so much comfortable maybe Ill do iPhone SE 2022 if updating is an issues in feature loss
Whoa whoa whoa if we make thunderbolt now what features we are gonna introduce next year Cmon man
No fastcharging and usb 20 Who buys these things thats a joke
Ok so its basically iPhone14 with USBC
yep im in the dont care group side its just selling outdated tech in the form of a modern body with a quatter bitten apple logo just a money scam
Still with the iPhone 11 not planning to change any time soon
Hey Marques someone captioning your videos is completely wrong and was very confusing as a deaf person figured you should know thanks
I still  wonder who still buys an iPhone   wake up  its 2023
So its basically an android now 
I have an iPhone 11 Pro so I think Ill probably upgrade I was disappointed by this years changes I wanted to upgrade last year but with the dynamic island feature I was hoping this year theyd hide it or give the option to hide when watching videos Ill probably get used to it over time but would be great if that were an option If my battery didnt suck so much I would keep my 11 for another year And no I wont get a battery replacement I did that 2 years ago and the idiots ar geek squad couldnt do it properly so Ive been rocking a refurbished phone since Yeah I definitely need to upgrade 15 pro here I come
Unsubscribed its time to move on
Can we use usa brought phones in India
Subtitles are not synced
for me the cc is different just not the right one for the video
Loool apple users are deluded You can tell he aint impressed
I got a iPhone XR and want to upgrade to a iPhone pro but idk which one to choose any advise 
Apple is running out of ideas for the next phones problably the iphone 16 big change will be fast charging
Do you know something about camera flare issue
Hes probably had it for six weeks prior to launch
"Marques let me tell you what i think about the a17 chip i think for this year for the PROS we will get the 3nanometer a17 pro chip but the next gen the normal iphone 16 we will get the the a17 chip but not the pro one or the 3nanometer one just an a17 that is what i think 

Hope you read my comment"
I dont like I phone it always looks the same nothing exciting and the camera looks terrible at the back
Waste of money
"Apple we have usb and a customizable button
People OMG INCREDIBLE
Android We had that for decades
People Shut up let us buy our overpriced products in peace"
slightly updated phone
"The new design is what most people are fawning over at the moment
I literally cant tell the 14 apart from the 15"
Boring upgrade from apple You know its a boring release when the headline upgrade is the switch to USBC  something that the EU forced Apple to do whilst their lawyers were kicking and screamingl You could swap my iPhone 12 pro max with the 15 pro max whilst I was sleeping during the night and it would probably take 2 weeks for me to even notice
An action button that takes photos Like Windows Phones
whats up with captions they are completely off
Wow The most exciting feature for apple this year is Usb type c Wow
enable subtitles you will not regret it 
Its your video make ip15 fun but very disappointed I wont buy it
Apples adoption of this standard is generally good news even if the companys hand was kind of forced by a European Union mandate that requires mobile devices to adopt USBC by late 2024
They are going to sell fast charging on usbc as a new feature next year 
They quoted you in hope that you dont shit on their products
Thank you EU
Iphone 15 15 Pro  still a waste of money
useless phone 
Definitely getting one but mostly just because my current phone is the iPhone XR that came out in 2018 lol
Question  does it have optical zoom for 48MP The iPhone 14 doesnt only 1X The marketing by Apple is misleading and vague when it talks about telephoto and 48MP in the same sentence
Looks like if you have a 14 dont touch it
Having a fresh battery in my 13pro I cant think of any reason to upgrade to basically the same 15 It still sucks in bright sunlight where it will dim byond visible speed I am sure is faster but who cares Bigger camera again for my WhatsApp pictures Nope for buying more iCloud storage probably as the pictures will increase in size No thanks Ill pass
Why this dude look like mozzy lol brother 
Lets hope the EU forces apple to some sanity in other areas like an upgradeable ssd in their laptops you know so I dont have to put in the bin when if fails especially for a device that can have a 10 year life otherwise
Apple talked about you in the presentation man are you losing credibility and selling out
You do know that usbc was forced by Europe right European laws dictated to have 1 and the same connection type for all cellphones to reduce electronic waste
Alas still terrible battery life  My current tech solution 2 iPhones
I majored in Materials Engineering in undergrad so i have special opinions on this using titanium is a waste The element is relatively rare compared to the iron used in steels and has special properties that cant be replicated in other metals corrosion resistance in the body fo medical implants comes to mind So the rarity drives up the price when i dont really see much of a benefit to the new metal cuz as you said the glass is the weak part of the phone And if youre just going for lower density then aluminum is a much cheaper and more effecfive option speaking strictly in terms of density Like i get its all to taste but still i dont really see the need to use titanium in smart phones
Its simply not worth the upgrade from a 14 Pro They barely spoke about the video capabilities but instead focused more on photography Apple showed ZERO comparison between pictures on the 14 and 15 Pro Thats a red flag
Basically nothing changed All those features were already available in androids I want something new that only iphone can do
Apple really dont even care about trying anymore do they Literally making phones out of recycled garbage 
I got the iphone 14 pro max i just hope its better but well see
Surreal to see an iPhone with a USBC port No it isnt Its a small hole where a cable goes not a portal to another dimension
No remarkable change no extraordinary feature It is Just for Apple Fanboy mkbhd please stop being a fanboy Constructive Criticism is the best way to improve the product Its apple 23rd iPhone and I dont see any remarkable change done by apple since long time
Wow  
This is the year I give up on this brandThey became just scammers
Such revolution of iphone15 to have usb type ci bet this is the world first usb type c phoneim so gonna get 1
When will such manufacturers deploy metalens in their products and drive sensor fusion to their capabilities and enhance user experience
So just usbc   excellent
This is the first iPhone Im on the fence about I will probably get it but Im in no hurry theres nothing groundbreaking enough this time around Still a fanboy though
"the meh upgrade 
USBC mandated by regulations so not really on them as an amazing upgrade just doing something that doesnt require a near useless proprietary cable
USB3 speeds how many people dl from their phone via a wire

And no fast charging just shows that they dont listen to customers

I mean I do love the cameras but the upgrades are more of an iphone 14plus type of improvements

an assignable button really

this seems like the upgrade to skip and wait for the next one maybe then theyll have something worthy of paying for"
EU regulations made apple to make USB C Google it
Seems subtitles are wrong
Its wild that people give a shit about these releases for iPhones So boring
My XS Max is barely holding on I guess this is as good a time as any to upgrade 
Pathetic upgrades  Gonna keep my Pro 13 for as long as possible and replace the battery when it stops holding a charge  Dont want to give apple any more of my money  Theyre more concerned about the next Pride  event than making noticeable upgrades to their products
I have the iPhone 12 I wish I could upgrade to the iPhone 15 but cant afford one
Im in camp boughttheiphone14pro2monthsagoatagoodprice
"Only if 15 had 120Hz
That would be the ideal choice"
The captions are all messed up
The subtitles on your video are talking something else
I am watching the video because it is my yearly tradition to watch the latest iPhone review by MKBHD I have been doing this from iPhone 8X and I will continue it forever I bought Iphone X after watching your video and then I bought iPhone 14 Pro last year This year is a skip for me Thanks for the reviews as always
U just having dirty money 
When it was unveiled I saw so many people say imma stick with my iPhone 10 1314 etc and now all Im seeing is Im not getting my new phone until late October  lmfao crazy how fast people switch but anyways I have a 13 and Im considering a 15 pro max since Ive never owned a pro and Im really curious about the filming quality I would love to compare it to my sonya6700 and I know a6700 is better overall but having a iPhone would be easier to film with
Captions not working properly
FINALLY its USBC I still dont want one again though
New Features 
Titanium has a lower tensile strength compared to steel Please stop beliving urban legends  the advantage of titanium is its weight and relative strength compared to aluminium which is why you can find it in airplanes
I dont actually care right now  13pro max still really solid
worst iPhone ever
Great drinking game for apple users take a drink every time you hear the word same in this video
Ill stick with my 14 plus I dont see a reason to switch its really no different
You are biased now
Im tired of the bumps on the back of these phones That shit needs to go Id rather have a flat back with thiccer phone That back glass is a pain in the ass to repair because of that shit Also Having naked phones sit uneven if you like running that way is not practical Im not paying these premium material priced just to cover that shit up Make shit more repairable and make shit actually function At least Nokia had something right
How can the dynamic island not be a distraction for most people I really wish they focused on truly full screen phones without any notchespunch holes etc
Youve uploaded incorrect closed captions file
Do not look at my description
Subtitles are out of sync with the video its annoying listening and trying to read 
Apple 1 at making you pay more and more for the usual stuff
Has nothing on samsugn s23 ultra
The title should be changed to not even USB C
The subtitles had me dying
Really love apple fans talking about iphone  they always blown my mind
"I feel like this phone might finally be the wake up call to switch to android for a lot of people
Its the exact same phone with barely any change since the 12 or is it the 11

and with feature weve had on android for literally 10 years yet comes out on iphone in 20232024"
"I love the way Apple makes an ageold feature like customizing a button to do more things than just one function more novel than it is 
I have been using this feature on Mi phone for at least 5 years now If I doubleclick it it opens a flashlight if I tripleclick it opens a different userselected application "
So MKBHD wont mention 15 and 15 plus only has 60hz and not fast  charging  and only usb 20 in 2023 Totally laughable 
They are saving call recording iphone 21
Ill just wait to upgrade my old iPhone until its USBC Thuderbolt Transfer speeds are just too important
They do this thing whereThis years base phone inherits last years specswow
Going bat shit crazy for a 20 charging port This is sad
Wow loving it
I like apple and swear to god I have used 6 8 and than android got second phone 14 used it for 34 months along with samsung s22 ultra apple is shit to use looks cool but games work like shittttttttall of them even a simple snooker sucks forget abt cod and others
They just changed it to fit new EU regulations 
Apples has lost their mind and going after money only No innovation or creativity Selling old tech at higher prices just beaucse of its brand value
True innovation is zero in apple products
Burn that phone
I find it funny that some people think that apple invented USBC after this phone was announced
Ha i phone suxs in a couple years android will be making it
Was expecting change in design but apple is just fooling people
Worst brand phone 
Worst phone ever made 
So let me get this right  the best new features are a new usbc port and a customisable button Ground breaking
So basically no real improvement in the camera and a very compromised USB implementation unless you buy the Pro or Pro Max and no Thunderbolt which would have had them leap frogging the opposition Ill stick with my 12 Pro until Apple actually decides to innovate again The camera choices in particular are puzzling You buy the Max and you only have the 120mm and you lose the 70mm in exchange for a cropped 24mm For most photography thats a poor compromise
I dont understand why no one is complaining about a sim slotnot all countries have Esims If you want one you have to buy one in europe
Good review but nothing to make me need to bump up my iPhone 14Pro
I think that subtitles doesnt match a video
Should hv called it the 14s
Im not even ashamed to admit it the Action button made me buy the 15 Pro Max I got a great deal from my carrier too but a dedicated flashlight button is going to be life changing 
"THE ONLY reason for Apple placing USBC on their product is because EU forced them to comply
Whomever believes otherwise is a simpleton and deserves to be ripped off by Apple"
why that much useless n boaring talk
How is the glass back for holding the phone Is it slippery
JerryRigEverything has enter the chat
Marques youre very gorgeous and beautiful  love your videos  look forward to the iPhone 15 Pro Max as I can get a new iPhone each year with my carrier EE that upgrade program similar to Apple Wont be able to get it until December
Hopefully big anti consumer fines for apple for deliberately limiting USBC speeds despite this being against the USBC standard I mean why do this to your customers scummy move
I remember a camera that allowed you to change the blur on what ever subject after the picture was taken  The company went out of business years ago but I cant remember the name  I think the name started with and L but not sure  So once again Apple added something to their camera thats been done by someone else years ago
YouTubers SMH funny how yall not talking about why in 2023 the iPhone 15 a 800 phone still is 60Hz not gonna talk about the more expensive iPhone 15 plus whiles yall torched Samsungs flip 5 cover screen for being 60Hz Its hypocrisy
I remember back in middle school and high school when i got a new iphone you felt cool like wow my iphone is the sht Now when you get a new iphone people are like look at this clown he actually paid that much for a brand new iphone
Apple 10 years late 
I need that wallpaper
Whats the refresh rate on 15 Is it 120Hz
I guess Im keeping my iPhone 11 for another year No need to dump a grand on an iPhone with USB C
i cant believe they have these ugly washed out colors tho like these phones look like the easter  edition
I wonder if I can use the 15 mounted on my motorcycle without the camera being destroyed from the vibrations like in the older models
Its the same shit since Iphone 4 came out in 2011 lol
One line review nothing new but I dont want to make them my enemies
Fast charging is probably for the next pro model 
"F them and that glass back
Ive literally broken every and each one since the iPhone X"
Crazy how you say same as the 14 but its nice Stop excusing apple just because you like it theres nothing that its so new that we are like wanting to have the 15
Give me that usb c port
great review convinced me nothing that much new worth paying 1300 for a new phone My iphone works just fine
Shame about the brain damaging radiation
I almost clicked thumbs down cuz I saw iPhone 15 
That action button is going to be amazing The amount of time i thumble trying to get flash light or camera on is insane
Its already so sad to know that there are people out there who get a new phone every year even worse that it has to be the newest iPhone every year from a company that has held back every last known feature for years only to put it in their newest phone the next year and sell it as innovation its so tragic and funny at the same time but imo more tragic by now
 SOMETHING WRONG WITH APPLE iPhone 15 Pro is first iPhone wich I dont want to buy My iPhone 14 Pro is the SAME Especially I dont understand of the reason to buy iPhone 15 if iPhone 14 Pro is cheaper and BETTER WtF APPLE 
Inflation is literally ripping peoples money up right now but hey lets bump up the price of the iPhone 15 promax at least it comes with more space right out the box
"People are waking up to apples little minute upgrades every year just to sell more phones 
Im still on 13 pro max  not getting another till theres a major upgrade 
I might just switch to another brand to make it interesting"
Wow 10 million views  wondering how much  would get at the end of the month 
"c type huhh 
iam still using samsung phone with b type charger "
Apple tried to fight the EU ruling on USBC but failed and complied in the end I applaud the the EU for taking that stand
marques your subtitles are all screwed up bud Not sure if this is you or youtube but just fyi
Nicd
love it
thanks for the good review i like how the switch button is now being replaced with the customizable action button its going to be super useful when u have to take a quick look at for smth
The competition for this has been doing everything this has been doing for years now Apple out here again just slapping apple lables on existing tech and people go ape over it
2 hours to charge for a phone in 2023 
Wow this 13 min video is 100x more informative than that cringey wonderlust presentation   I cant help but think its insane how much they talk about the outer casing in new models  we all just put a MF case on the phone anyways  I guess uber rich people dont use cases because they can drop 1k if they drop their phone so it might be cool to them but I dont think they care either But yeah Apple should be able to look at your Apple account and offer a lightning rebate to all of the hundreds of dollars we spent on lightning peripherals   Im not a negative Nancy all the time but that was the worst Apple presentation I can remember
They still wont allow split screen on iPhones Come on now Android has had it since 2016
when the biggest change is the USBC imagine how tiny the changes are not worth it take 14 pro
Captions are wrong
928 Android users have been using Button Mapper apps while few other android phones do provide inbuilt customization for almost all buttons
the subtitle
bulshitzu its still an old phone
Nothing really amazing about this iphone iPhone owner a C charger better camera faster processor Is it really a life changing feature Nop
it coming with slow down updade
MKBHDyou dont need Apple money Just say Apple has been as boring as Tim Cook himself
Maybe Fairphone and apple should collab
Supposedly the Pro models can charge up to 35W but Im not sure if that has been confirmed yet If anyone has confirmation leave a comment here please so I can be informed
Honest doubt Cant they just M2 chip in iphone
no innovation whatsoever its like going backwards  little bit while moving forward know what i mean
Great video but lol subtitle doesnt match with what he is saying
Thank you EU for giving us all a single cable
Just wait for the iPhone 16 so they can add fast charging to the next pro max
BORING
Its the most non innovating phone ever 
I am sick of apple promoting the thing that android have from 10 years You guys are using USB C as the biggest thing in the world The reason iphone havent been cancelled upto now is because of these influencers
I mainly ordered it cause I wanted the 14 pro but just got the 13 pro so I was just about ready to upgrade when this phone was available
I got my iPhone 12 pro max back when it was launched and every year I say to myself that Ill buy a new one whenever they will do a remarkable upgrade Still using 12 pro max 
CLEARLY  MARQUES WASNT  PAID BY APPLE  HUGE  TO  OVER SENSATIONALIZE  THE  USB C  PORT LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  nothing new
Is the 15 Pro the same exact size as the 14 pro  Can they use the same cases
HeyI was wondering if the black titanium color is still prone to fingerprints similar to the space grey or midnight options frome the past
So basically Innovation is dead with Apple Tweaking buttons and software is decades old process which others have done exhaustingly and better
Basically there is no change 
bruh did you know your the highlights in that event saw you in one video looks like everyones keep on filming you holding that camera
Its interesting nobody is talking about that Apple slipped in USB3 only with an Apple certified cable Adding to the confusion Its like their middle finger to the EU that only an MFI cable will trigger their USB3 controller
For those that dont know the reason why apple iphones have usb typec now is because of eu regulations Im curious how apple is going to about this and selling their own branded high end usb charging cables
Whats wrong with the subtitles
Same phonenow you get USBC Give me a thousand dollars
Will you do a Huawei Mate 60 Pro review
Samsung is way past technology and features compared to Apple
Well I guess Im Waiting another year to upgrade my 13 pro max 
Bro you take Ankers money Im disappointed in you They are spyware
No where near enough of an upgrade from my 12 to buy Going to wait another year and see if they do anything innovative but since Steve jobs died its basically been the same bs I used to stay with apple because of iMessage but now thats used less and less Im starting to wonder why Im sticking with them If theyre being innovative they shouldnt bring out annual iPhones
wicked bro i love buying apple products Im the biggest apple glazer
I watched this with captions and the captions were so wrong LOL
Titanium PLATING isnt stronger its still an aluminum chassis with a thin coating of titanium probably plated
Iphone is lost for ideas I really want to see what theyll be adding to this near perfect phone in the next years
iPhone 11 basic to iPhone 15 pro lets get it 
10 faster once they release the updates for older gens to slow them down lve got the 14 l honestly dont see the real change with these welcomed changes its Id recommended buying the 14 save on the  get the same phone unless you are a die hard apple fan
I always wait 3 years to get a new phone  I just preordered the iPhone 15 pro max from the 12 pro max so we will see how it is
Theyre paying you big cash my bro thats whats going on
"Thank you for the great presentation  Not impressed with the iP15 features so far  Actually looking for a larger screen display sharper features especially ZOOM enhancements when recoding  Privacy is  the biggest issue for my needsthats why I didnt switch to the Fold or Ultra but Im SO interested  Recently went to a concert and was sadly disappointed in saving a moment  The outcome of my cherished moment sucked comparable to the Ultra show off
seated in front of me snatching moment after moment of sheer delight as if it were close enough to touch  How rude Right  Just saying"
Im just happy to get off the 12  My 12 is an overheating POS that dies so fast Never had any issues with prior iphones tho Just the 12 pro lmao
"Not Just USBC

Literally just usb c and small few changes  60hz  display and usb c 20 480mbs which released 2000 is not mentioned "
Many of these features have been on Android for years
After you see live the colors Which color do u like it more blue titanium or natural titanium As want to help me decide which one to make preorder
OPEN THE SUBTITLE AND EVERYTHING CHANGES
I find you very cute when they dont even know where the world is nowadays You are all using iPhones just like millions of others and calling yourselves tech enthusiasts America is full od isheep
In short Apple has bamboozled their loyal customers 
"Apple is drifting the gap in their iphone models

The fluidity in the lineup is what would attract a user to their phones in current competition Of being able to use the best technology in whichever form factor one would prefer with some differences for high end models The iphone 15 and 15 plus are a downgrade for value provided and apple has continued it for years 

Ever since promotion was introduced it would be the standard addition to their entire lineup and for years apple is getting away by not providing the standard for the price they charge Let alone the old processor camera differences and the cheeky way of not providing type C 30 all for base models

Its good to see the android market is flourishing and samsung phones offer much better improvements to the iphone counterparts in every aspect"
Hi actually would like to know despite of operating system just comparing side by side of the camera of iPhone 15PM  Xperia 1V and also Samsung S23U which one you would recommend the most as of now
In short wait another until 2030 for a new iPhone upgrade 
is the sensor of 15pro bigger than 14 pro sensor size dough
Nothing that convinces me to switch from current Android I like my 64GB dual sim Oppo relic 
Can you review huwai met 60 pro 
USBc and they removed the switch Very innovative
just ordered three but kinda wish i got all pro max since they seem like the most bang for your buck i didnt know the 15 base didnt have the action button one of the features i was looking forward to the most also ill never understand why the pros have boring colors when they are built for creatives and professionals in an artistic manner makes no sense
Man shot this on a RED
Very disappointed with iphones now every year it is  the same phone and release the same phone every year with 13 extra features it is high time for Apple to enter other markets more strongly
Parvadta nahi re baba 
Iphone 15 pro and pro max are such a scam They just finally added usb 30 to the Iphone for transfer speeds Thats mind blowing So now it is kinda finally fast until probably next years new iphone and updates What are they going to come up with next year wireless charging from the iphone to other devices and probably apple would be like no one has ever done this and all the apple fan boys will go running to spend 1k again The Iphone is a good product it is just a fashion statement Apple hasnt innovated in years they just steal android features and change the name and make it sound like if it was the invention of the wheel I love your videos dont get me wrong is that I just dont like how apple scams people 100 dollars for watch bands hahahaha you can get 5 for 15 dollars in Amazon and actually even better quality The Apple 50 dollar cheap watch band gave my wife allergies Also why isnt Apple saying that the Iphone is the most secure device anymore Apple is the one who most sells their users information
They did usb C cause without it they coul not sell it in Europe
And dont forget 60hz  slow charging and no pause during video recording
wow the action button somethings the samsung s6 active had
"Is worth it 
Still need wait for other series"
"I have 14pro
And I dont think so any one having 14P should be buying this 15 pro
Lets see what they add in 16 or 17
I am waiting till 17P"
wow dude I used to watch your videos back when I had a Samsung Galaxy 6 I would watch you break down the tech specs for that and the iPhone 6 I went on to work for Apple Support and I see you were invited to their event crazy how time flies like that congratulations on your thriving youtube career
As a casual phone user Ill stick with the 13Pro one more year Perhaps by iPhone 16Pro everything will be ironed out and Ill get more for my money
Not enough to upgrade for me  Got an iPhone 14 and more lightning cords than I know what to do with  Maybe it would have been a possibility had it also had fast charging  So close but still falls short as an upgrade
Iphone 15 looks dope but I just have one important question when will gamers stop affiliating the Iphone with COD Mobile
I am pretty sure that they used the A17 Pro for their 3 NM A17 processor and I am very sure that iPhone 16 will have a 4 NM version A17
Aint no why Im going to USBC Ill just stop at the 14
Should wait for iPhone 20 or 21 way better camera quality
Worth upgrading from 13 pro  Tbh 13pro still feels new to me when using it
Ill be honest I love iPhone but they deleted the pax app so Im going with Samsung
i was already planning to upgrade my phone with the 14 pro max but decided to wait for usb c so im totally getting one
Could u please give me an iPhone as a give away please
"I guess they should let you do the Apple presentation going forward
It will save us time and it would be crisp short and without unnecessary glorifying decade old technology by apple guys"
subtitle caption is broken
Glass is glass and glass breaks
Ive been an Android user since the galaxy s Usb c will now make me seriously consider switching to iPhone
people still using icrap  i thought it was dead for many years and now talking about usb c  they always behind and 60 hrtz screen  what an icrap 
icrap
This clown brought a red camera to apple released phone  
Im getting one this S23 ultra is driving me nuts Its awful
I want a wireless charger lol lets think outside the box apple 
Am good with my one plus
"If you ever feel useless
You should know that someones job was to design the shape of the iPhone 15"
"i think apple saved A17 chip for new phone
i think next year apple will introduce iphone 16 with A17  16pro with A18 pro"
am i the only one who was thinking subtitles arent matching what he is saying in the non AutoGenerated one
Oh USBClike my Samsung which I have had sinceforever ago Great I will buy cheaper iphone 13
hahahaat the end of the day nothings newits just usb cthats all
Your friends Android phone 
Apple successfully learnt from fake iPhone from Hua Cheng bei with type C charging 
Wireless charging also made wave to where they agreed to move to USB C
Samsung already had all these features Same shit different tiolet
lol usbc lol
Im still waiting to be excited about an Apple product update
USB 2 on the base iPhone and no fast charging at all in the lineup is a whole new level of pettiness from apple from being forced to switch to usbc
You realize that the EU legislation made them move to USBC They had no choice
i think this has got the wrong captions uploaded
Its just a bootleg Android 
Dont care at all Happy with 13
MKBHD The subtitles are completely wrong pls fix
"Already switched to Samsung after being Apple user for 13 years I am not waiting for apple to fart every year and charge 100 extra for each new apple features like USB 3 lolz   Life will move on without apple going forward Dont hate me apple lovers
"
The end of Do You have a Apple Charger
"Im good with my iPhone 13
iPhone 19 my next purchase"
How is the minimum focus distance of the main camera The iphone 14 pro max has a horrible 79 focus distance before switching to 05 lens
Not Just USB C price hike too
They paid him for this review its low key the same shit lol
boring iphonethe only innovation is color
been waiting for the iPhone 15 for the longest now I can Finally afford to buy an iPhone 8
I never bought even the 1st iphone
So iPhone 15 bringing back the feature of Lytro Camera hnnn 
Usbc is from Android  Wheres the haters
No wow factors and the colors are horrid
Some clarification on the more repairable iPhone bit Apple had already designed the iPhone 14 and 14 to be able to replace the back glass but did not do so on the 14 ProMax This generation they designed all the models to have replaceable back glass Im an Apple certified repair technician and thought that insight might be useful to some 
Are we really have to talk about usb c After minimum 7 years we talking about iPhone that finally have usb c What the F is wrong with those people who are so into nothing new in iPhone Theyre making reviews like this is the only smartphone on market
so it was just the usbc neat
Also the 15 pro doesnt get the 5x telephoto camera only the pro max gets it So if you dont like big phones youre out of luck
but have they fixed heating issues in hot weather
New iphone  Cost more does less
ive never owned a apple product in my life probably never will but i like this one 
sad that i wont have usb c for a while but im happy that i get to keep the mute switch
2049 here in nz for the pro 256g no apple care 349 but delivery is free haha
Category Cannot afford it XD XD
Regular iPhone 15 only has a 60 hz screen  Thats pathetic its an 800 dollar phone
WTF is wrong with the captions
210 your friends android brow we dont beg for chargers its the apple usrs looking for chargers and i dont even know how many times i have wirelessly charged my friends iphones dont give us the crap that iphone made usb C to help out the android all thanks to EU to break the monopoly of apple for bringing cash in by selling the lightening cable port  saving both the apple users from finding chargers and the android users from being bullied for being the low budget apple killers
Where is the Mini version Not everyone wants to hold a minitablet Well maybe next year
I dont give a fuck about the rest of this im waiting for something that will blow my mind
Im in the camp of I need my Pixel 6 gone yesterday And Ive never had a modern iPhone and Im debating on trying that or going completely bleeding edge and getting a Pixel Fold  I could still go either way honestly idk
Their usb c is not just for charging ofc 
Lol charging my earphones technologycooli used mate 20 last time to charge my earphones  thats 7 years ago How slow apple technology
I remember samsung made the same thing for s7 edge on their worthless bixby button you can swap anything for that button
iPhones are the most overhyped product in the market
325 another feature samsung already has
Im in camp already preordered two pro max one for me and one for my fianc
Haha this phone is the same These upgrades are comical at this point
Literally same phone Always an L with iphones lol
The ONE PIECE
Now I have to share my charging cable with iPhone users 
Nate
The usbc cable honestly kinda sucks durability wise Ive had mine for about a year and already its super difficult to get my phone to charge The cable easily falls out and my phone ends up not charging The cable does work and the charging is unbelievably fast but whats the point if it doesnt stay connected My best guess is because dirt and grime easily make it difficult to latch and perhaps the latching part within the cable is not very good unlike my previous iphone and iphone charger lasted forever So unless they engineer this cable to be able to latch properly this cable is a big flop
10 million views in 2 days is crazy 
and people still gonna buy the same garbage phone
"Lol not impressed
Change the fking design ffs
11 is almost same like 15"
When the battery doesnt even get mentionedsigh Apple
Is it worth it going from the iPhone 12pro to the new one 
your subtitles are bugged
Now with more radioactive components
Your Content Stands Out In A Refreshing Way I Truly Appreciate The Absence Of Background Music In Your Videos As It Allows Your Message And Personality To Shine Through Without Distractions Keep Up The Great Work
117 Goodbye Lightning no one will miss you
60 hz in 2023 on 800 phone Wow
I love wireless Anker products  or as I call them wAnkers 
fewer upgrades not worth it if you have 11 to 14 stick with that for 7yrs  i did stick to my 6 for 9yrs before changing to 12 pro max  its very worth the money maybe 7yrs from now iphone will have rice cooker included
Its surreal to look at an iPhone and see usb c  Jesus man
Funny how a lot of people dont know one of the main reasons for Apple going USBC is because the UK had a suit to make them change it in their country so they just made the change everywhere
I only update my iPhone every 4 years and the changes are definitely there but I could never justify trading it in every year If they get fast charging next year Ill renew 
use a DEesser
iPhone 16 Weve put  USB 30 into the device iPhone 16 Pro We give you fast charging
What a joke 
Im surprised by your statement I have a regular 12 and charging completely takes always way less than an hour
Was on the fence about upgrading my 11 pro max to the 15 pro max Gonna hold off for another year I think Just didnt catch my eye Grabbed a whole new PC instead because I desperately needed an upgrade lol
Usbc is the biggest iPhone upgrade in a long while Unless your a sucker who says they like the notch or they like the pill shaped cutout that others were doing in 2019 Still missing lots of feature for what they charge
"Already pre booked iphone 15 promax

Great review btw MKBHD"
I still use 8 and happy enough  no point to switch
These influencers whom apple pay will never stop convincing people to buy and they will just accept it
Waiting for the iPhone 16 with Transistor Technology
I would rather listen to techodyssey for the truth Not this fancy tale
When will Apple have 4 cameras
Cant believe you are talking about usbc as a feature
WoW In Canada it is  a 150000 CND plus taxes 15 or 172500 with taxes for the 14 Pro Max But it is just about cameras and better screen and no development on NFC applications exept for the apple Pay Im not a selfier so Ill stick with my old one Until apple decide to take care of other than the vain
did they make a screen that wont crack 1k plus and they cant come up with a screen that wont break
How is this new people dont buy this
I really wish they would have allowed you to map multiple actions to the new button For example hold to mute doubleclick to open the camera and triple click to turn on Focus Maybe well see that in the future
This guy out here using IMAX camera for vlogs wow
Iphone12 SS
another underwhelming upgrade
English caption wrong set you put the watch 9 captions instead
Sorry did you just say usb 2 LMAO
Apple with the same bull
Apple used to amaze the world Now it is very  really high quality
Can you review ipnone 30
You forgot to mention paid Video Literally most of  other android phones better specs has then iPhone and you are trying to promote their product I am unfollowing you because you are not legit man
Nah Ill wait
My man thanks for the Close Caption but its useless
iPhone users scammed for the fifteenth time
So in summary nothing new or nothing that is not already in existence in other phones
"Its not even a common type c cable they make it internally different so you have to buy theirs to have the quality itd supposed to have apple being apple 




"
Only apple could market something like USB c as a new improvement
us1100 To get USBC
Just preordered the the iPhone 15 Pro Max
Sooooo isnt an android i phone Their desperate and late to the game 
LolHow is this the worlds flagship phone Looks like a thick brick with gigantic bulging camera lenses  USB 20 No fast charge The UI looks like garbage so stale like using windows XP at this point
I have an 11 so Im gonna upgrade 
Finally convinced that i have made the rigjht decision for buying galaxy s23 plus
Have 14 pro max Ill pass the 15 perhaps 18
Lol i can wirelessly charge my earbuds from my s23 ultra Remember when Apple was um innovative Steve does
So whos falling for this again 
Is it just me or are the captions offnot matching with the audio
Subtitles seem to be from a different video
wait hour and a half to charge  when i charge my phone USBC to Lightning it takes 3045 min to full charge iPhone 14
Cool but not need to change my 13 pro max will sped the money in something that will represent me more
I want to able to send videos longer than 4 minutes on iMessage Its annoying when I have to cut long videos in 4 minutes to increment to able to send it via iMessage
Is the screen glass rounded or completely flat
bro i was waiting for the first iphone with usbc like forever but bruh the iphone got nothing exciting for me to make me get it ill keep using my samsung i guess
Would be really nice if you could test the usb c to the max Since it is usb3 it could deliver a video signal like on the android ones
Weirdly Im nore interested in the watch this time around I hadnt been interested in them before this
Hour and a half to 2 hours to fully charge Are you using a type c Lmao mine goes from 10100 in 40 minutes
Thanks MarkAss brownlee for this review
Classic apple copy  paste every year
Someone gotta fix the captions
dude Im so surprised when I heard the iPhone 15 was announced I was like oh interesting Apple As easy as U S B  C Me  n e u r o n  a c t i v a t i o n
If you want real innocationstop buying apple for couple of years
OH MY GOSH APPLE USB C No this is 23 year old technology and they were forced to by the uk dont act like its some big win for apple they had to or they wouldnt be able to sell in the uk 
Im on the upgrade plan Almost bit the cord on buying the new iphone this year but decided not to since there wasnt much crazy upgrades I will buy it next year though
"What a disappointment 
I came from s22 ultra thinking the 14PM would be a good investment so far 3510 so I said okay the 15PM will be way better hum that bs is f up
Im just gonna wait for the new galaxy atp"
Still nothing changed for another year
notting is going to be new
The way that the new mute button is customizable to open apps camera etc is the exact same feature as double tap on my pixel
Not just usb C but a 300 dollar price bump as well
So theyre going with titanium to say that its rugged and tough but then theyre gonna continue with the whole glass in the back so basically its still a glass phone  Apple is getting desperate scared of innovation selling you the same phone six years in a row
got the anime subtitles
You can giveaway your USB lighting device Got robbed off my iPhone My heart is still sore
Fast charging ruins your battery
I dont think the captions are aligned with the video
So the iphone trying to put a virus on Samsung phones if I let a iphone user use my charger Or my charger wont work anymore 
so much hype this iphone was supposed to be a big leap from the previous and supposed to change the design and yet we get a usb c iphone 14
So basically i should just stick with my 13 pro max Got it 
I tried to get excited about the new iPhone but I feel its pretty meh Sure the USB C is nice Took them long enough to do it and it was just because they were forced All the changes in this phone seem to just bring it up to par with existing android phones I think if Apple doesnt up there innovation game soon they will get left behind
The subtitles needs a award
Subtitle does not work correctly on this video
Apple been bending over their customers for decades now and their customers keep taking it
I dont care about USBC I use wireless charging and magsafe
so its just an iphone 14 with usb c
Can we just skip to iPhone 16 pro max max
The hype is remarkable
Super helpful video as I still love my 12 I dont think Ill upgrade unless theres a great deal around the holidaysdoubt it since its the newest model but well see 
i wonder how much apple is paying him just for the title of this video 
My iPhone 12 Pro Max is still better
What could they add Stuff you think you need cause they told you so
There are alot of nice advance phones but I keep buying iphone bcoz of its operating system I need not mention those high end brand fons I had those simply gave me headache bcoz the operating system is the issue In fairness to iphone itself its durable lesser wear and tear this is according to my  usage or how I use it
same phone
USB C is the headline bro this is 2023
AirPod Max 2 release When i know u asked 
Wow the new iPhone with a charger that everyone else has been using for 12 years now
Marques Brownlee  the Platinum standard of Technology Reviews
23rd iphoneiphone 15 waaaaaat
Definitely a sellout for this one
i think its the perfect time for me to upgrade from my very good fella iphone 5s thats a 10 gen dif
Im just keeping my 14 pro max and I cant give up the purple yet its awesome
Is not worth it i have the 13pro i feel that it would such waste of money to upgrade to the new iPhone
Fun fact the new Pro chip performs better than the Steam Deck
How much youve got paid for this video
Lambon
pre ordered my 15 today upgrading from a 12 so i should feel something i guess but im disappointed it looks the same
same
Im on a iPhone 11pro now And will def be waiting for the 16 
I preordered today 
Absolutely nothing new apart from new forced universal charging hole
man removing the mute switch is one of the dumbest things apple has done since the removal of the headphone jack i loved that little guy the fact that it was an actual switch and not a button is literally the only reason people liked it
Not even going to buy it Terrible upgrades
Looks like Im waiting until fastcharging becomes a reality otherwise not worth switching just yet
Same iPhone as the iPhone 15 Nothing new
I just wish Iphone had the capabilities to use APKs and 3rd Party Software
Not sure if anyone has pointed this out but the subtitles seems wrong
Apple newest features is something that the world had since 2014 well done your only 9 years behind in 2023 maybe in 2030 you can shorten that gap to 5 years 
If I get the Pro do I still need to get a macbook or should I just hook up the phone to a screen and keyboard
I hate how some people act like apple did the usbc  for customer convenience and not because they were forced to because of European laws
Id never be able to give up the android ecosystem Live wallpaper Google Duo Nearby Share sd card etc
"Lmao wow a programmable button that android has had for YEARS

Iphones  POS"
Apple is honestly so pathetic lol
Apple never had an action button Wow been around forever
Honestly if you changed the title to iPhone 1414 Pro Impressions i wouldnt even notice
someone wake me up when apple disables the automatic Airpod pro battery level popup window im SO tired of that stupid function you can literally be in the middle of dialing 911 and you enter 9 1 and out pops that stupid invasive highest priority battery level window ive complained to them  they dont care
Definitely not switching over from my pixel to this new iPhone
I saw a guy on Tik Tok filming you filming these exact opening clips Nuts

I was totally ready to switch to iphone when i saw they added the USB C cable AND that it comes in pastel pink until i realized its not fast charging We were ROOTING for you Lol
Instead of improving AirDrop apple releasing this shitty nonfunctionalities as cutting the USBC to 20 in the standard model Using the stick and the carrot But I dont really understand how nobody said like hey isntnt this making fun of the users Can we have a communication crisis doing that at the same time Europe is forcing us to use an international standard You can just put USB3 in all as the minimum for a 1000 device and announce a new wireless and better transfer system so nobody cares about the EU and the USBC anymore Now apple looks like they have been laughing at us for a long time and continue to do so
Glad theyre caught up with 2018s Androids
Looks like mostly all hype to force your hand into something you dont really need
bro whya are the subtitles about the fifteen inch macbook air
To me the killer app for iPhone is always the custom Apple silicon and the performance it brings and this gen features a node shrink and a generational SoC by going to 3nm
Why usbc cuz the EU demands it
why people keep buying these phones as if they were the best ever is beyond me
im xs like forever i should upgrade now still doing good
Isnt usbc just to satisfy the Europe market 
Was thinking of switching to iphone after using android for a LONG time Ill think ill just get a samsung fold next
USB4 for Pro iPhone shouldve been the goal imo
What angers me the most is that I got the Airpods Pro gen 2 a couple days before they announced the switch to USB C
Well done 
which model are you going with  pro or pro max
Wait when did the 14 come out
Still not enough for me to upgrade Maybe Ill look again at 18
Holy shit a customizable buttontheyve really done it this time 
new model same old recycled phone
What about battery life
Thunderbolt transfer speeds on the 16 and fast charging improvements in the 17 Apple thinking hire meeee
Your closed captioning is for the Vision Pro video
As an iphone lover an owner  im sick  of them giving us the same shit every year  like really for you general consumer aside from a charging port its tge same phone from 12pro max to 15  like legit and im saying that as a 14pro max owner currently  we have to hold this company accountable idc if it takes longer  go back to your roots apple and actually be INNOVATIVE
whats with the subtitles of this video
Im convinced a lot of people would jump ship if it werent for the ecosystem 
"so they literally added nothing and now sell it for 1000 buks
imagine buying iphone 15 bruh"
All of this sounds like features that 90 of the population will never use
i got a 1TB 13 pro max when it came out and Ive been really happy with it I love seeing what apple does every generation so that I can decide which is the feature I want to upgrade for but for now and the next coming years probably Im keeping mine
Huawei 
"Self regulation is better 
Why usbc because EU
Soon no cable  all

Im messy with my cables"
Upgrading from my 11 pro max to 15 pro max
Ill just wait till apple pushes me out to get a new phone
New stealing level
Its the same as the last one the USBC is rubbish on Apple as it cant talk to the logic board to give more than 20W charging thats 8 years plus behind the time
The USB C and back glass being repairable May be because of EU norms 
Im still waiting for a pink iphone pro in the meantime Ill stick with the regular iphone 13 and now 15 in pink
Im still running a 1st gen SE so a new phone is in order soon just not sure I can swallow the pricing in Canada Its ridiculous 1599  12 tax for the 15 Pro with 256GB
Still not worth it until they come up with something better I probably give a try of HUAWEI Mate60 Pro
great review
As an Android guy I didnt know that the iphone didnt have fast charging Im impressed that so many people can live without it and still happy with their phones
10 MILLION VIEWS IN 2 DAYS  DAMNNNNNN
I will always buy 23 generations old phones Nothing in new phones that make me want to spend this much every year I buy once every 45 years and always an older version Thats about 500 per 4 years and my mates insist on 1200 every year Its just stoopid
Its a huge bummer that we only get the 30 usb c port without the fast charging feature
I preordered mine today Im excited 
"The big thing here is usb 

Apple fanboys  "
Im so tired of apple Give us something new and innovative Fuck it Im switching to Samsung for my next phone I dont use anything else apple Mac sucks iPads are just oversized iPhones
Personally Im quite happy with my 11 still Will probably upgrade to the 15 when the 16 or even the 17 releases and get the reduced price
Same old
I wonder if you can connect the iPhone pro model to an external display and use it like you would a Samsung phone with DEX
Appel is overraded asf
"Idk what to say Im a phone user
But there is some things I just dont see changing
Pricefeatures

At this point if the ps5 had cellular call function and mobile internet Id carry it around instead of the 15"
Im kind of surprised to see the obvious screws beside the usbc port Ugly and not very Apple like
"Im not trying to troll I have no idea why anyone is buying a iPhone these days 
I watch videos on all the latest and greatest There is nothing great about a iPhone I feel like every feature they add is something Ive had for at least 5 years now Somehow they have made people believe that they are inferior if they use anything other than a Apple 
First off Stop giving a damn what anyone thinks about you
Second You are absolutely wrong They are selling you a upgrade like they invented it They didnt
I get it We all get use to a system and dont want to change  If youre considering buying this Im just telling you that theres  so much better out there Do you though"
The 15s bring nothing to the table and thats a sad fact if youve got a 14 pro max and want the 15 pro max forget it Why would you
EVERY USBC port on every product Ive owned over the past few years ended up breaking after about a year of use Between not charging and not recognizing attached peripherals the port is trash
no usb 4
"Still after 5 years 
Nobody on the Net 
Doing reviews Better than MB

God bless 
You can be a role model for so many people 
From Israel Law firm"
I guess I will upgrade from 13 Pro to 15 Plus as it is best as per my use as it has the same quality camera setup as last year models except lidar and telephoto lens that I dont basically use that much except for portrait shots I have learnt that just because of 48 mp main sensor on basic 15 digital zoom 2x can be used for the portrait shots too so its amazing plus I will get bigger battery in that phone and it is good
subtitle is wrong the nonauto generated subtitle is totally different than video thanks to YouTube Ai for auto generated subtitle 
nothing same shit
the action button is terrible this phone is super underwhelming
This is a way Apple can charge you even more for a USB C cable that everyone owning a Android has Apple doesnt offer anything new and charges the same if not more each year
wow what a nothing burger
the price and quality makes me stick with one phone till they slow the phone down or i broke it i went from 7  9  11  14 my phone is good enough for my needs and we have kinda peaked on innovation on it so i dont think i will HAVE to get a new phone till the 17th
Lol they saving the fast charging for the next models to have something extra to say so its less of the same
Next time we are not only reduce carbon usage by reducing iPhone boxes but also remove all buttons on iPhone and increase price up to 1499 Amazing Ohh yeah and instead 23 cameras we will leave just one And no other new features Ladys and Gentlemens that is future 
He looks quite good for his age but no where near 2 million a year good Ive seen many people look younger than him without spending a dime
The captions 
"Heheh just pre ordered  2 pro max 1tb as we need new phones as Im finding out some apps bank apps not working  This is a huge upgrade as Im currently using an 8plus and really looking forward to this

Next on my Apple shopping list iPads buy now or wait"
"1 Everything android is trash 
2 making type c connection for iphone is first step to bankruptcy
3  i still using my iphone 11 and its the best phone in my life"
Welcome to TypeC era iDiots
I have been a Samsung user for an extremely long time Before that I had Apple So what can Apple do new well maybe adopt Samsungs technology then it might be worth buying
Im here cuz this is trending 91523lol 
Remember  Apple its a business and the target is money not humans satisfaction
"Waiting for the camera review to see if the lens flare and hdrdynamic range issue has been finally fixed  

Also disappointed no fast charging and thunderbolt support in pro models  maybe next year  

Also hoping battery life has been fixed because the rumors pointed to biggers batteries but proved to be false too "
So basically nothing new just updates to keep milking the cow
My HTC U had that nextgeneration portrait feature back in 2017
Yeah bc my fast charger is so slow on my iPhone This company gets these sheep to buy the same phone over and over I went from xr to 14 pro Not switching for a few years
Usb C speeds of usb 2 unless you pay extra Why do people keep letting Apple get away with these dirty money grabbing tactics It shouldnt be praised
YOU  ARE  WATCHING  A  COMMERCIAL 
Buy one if you dont know what to do with money
"I hope Android phones get USB C soon
wait we have that since the beginning "
Whats going on with the captions
I dont care at all But Ill upgrade cause my 12 Pro Max will still get me a top trade in value for maybe only one more year I could wait one more year and probably still get max trade in value but theres no guarantee So Ill probably swap it
Why the AirPods Max with the trash bag case and not Sony MX boys
Im tired of having cases on my iPhone I wish I was confident enough to walk around without a case 
No matter how good iphone can be it cannot win huawei China always number 1
As someone who hasnt upgraded since the 11 came out I can say from experience that I am upgrading to a 15 SOLELY because of the USBC Lightning sucks so much Glad its finally gone
They added USB C simply because they were forced to do so  It would never have been introduced for another two to three generations clearly by lack of fast charging and data transfer
Are you sane There were no innovations in iPhone products anymore They are just milking people now for their hard earned money
Ordered mine today
Nothing Just usbc that other phones already had for years and year
Good job being the 100th person to send out a review on this phone little too late to the game buddy
Iphone sucks I will wait for the pixel 88pro
Still sticking with 13
Wow USBC So revolutionary I wish every phone uses them
how much they have pay you 
Steve Jobs will be turning in his grave 
And people lined up for this Btw that button is copy from samsung side key feature introduced 2 years ago
I saw a clip of you filming the iPhone 15 with a handheld Red at the event making a guy feel self conscious about his small dslr camera was great
Another year of let downs
I went from iPhone 11 Pro Max to iPhone 13 mini and now I am switching back to the iPhone 15 Pro Max  such a rollercoster
I dont care how much hype This is a corny upgrade and the OS is boring too Sales will not be good this year
"No  the Titanium finish is not a raw titanium finish

Grade 5 TA6V Titanium is higher quality Titanium loosing its brownish tint to a nice pure Chrome type finish"
been a apple user forever im moving to samsung way better
Finally A cure for insomnia
Its funny how apple fan boys have their minds blown with USB C And that at it against apples will They were forced to use it This phone is essential the same spec for spec as the previous version with not on pixel extra Slap on some titanium and tell me its raining
Lol Android had these features and functions years ago 
So cool
BRING BACK THE MINI
MKBHDs favoritegame changing feature was the all new IBixby button cool
Thats pretty much why i upgraded to 14pro just before 15 Because my ecosystem is all lightning and i wont be upgrading all of them soon
Titanium right next to glass
Apple should take away face id and bring the fingerprint feature back to the side of the iPhone then make phones for left hand and righthand people
Nothing new nothing impressive
Subtitles are oooooffff
Oh no how will they top this next year
What is caption saying
LongBeach told me theres a camera Thats all I need to know
I have the 12 pro max kind want to upgrade so trade value is still good and my battery life is at 85 should I I do like my current phone is it worth just changing the battery
"Im in camp I was refusing to buy another iPhone until they had USB C camp so I might grab a 15 pro or pro max Ive got an 11 pro and its fine but the biggest upgrade for me is the max brightness Idk about other peoples 11 pros but mine isnt as bright as it used to be and Im using my phone in very bright environments a lot

Im not upgrading because its revolutionary its just been long enough I might as well and donate my phone to someone who needs a better one"
Same Shit 
Sure great product but the elephant in the room is the spectacular folding screens miss
MKBHD trying to explain alot of new features without alot of new features    WOW apple is running out of new features
so theres no fast charging what in the fuck
Gonna stick with my 13 Pro for now
Can you do a Huawei review
Next Gen Portraits Google Pixel already has this U can always add a portait blur to non portaits shots NextGen
Surprised you didnt mention spatial video
052 Is that a dark blue iPhone 15 According to specs there is only a light blue one Im confused
Its the same phone every year
So its pretty much just usb c No reason it should be 1500
can someone make a video taking moon photos with the two phones so I know which one to buy
I see Apple paid you handsomely Sell out
Gotta appreciate the effort Apple put into releasing the same phone as the last one lol
"I have had an iPhone since iPhone 3 With the sheer volume of money Apple are worth Its shocking to me that every year for the last few years now that the phones look exactly the same  with zero changes in look Its just boring We are paying for the same we have with a new shiny date with subtle but new changes innovation  zero Would really like Apple to atleast try and make something new or make it look new and cool I also hate how big these phones are getting 

Thats enough complaining for now Lol"
"I mean its a phone  
The fact that the tech in the phone is restricted to make more models each year tells you everything you need to know about Apple"
"Literally just got done pre ordering this Ive been waiting for this phone to come out to switch carriers We got a bunch of discounts switching so essentially I am paying 50 dollars less on my bills and am getting the new phone so its almost like its free XD Im stoked I have the 2022 iPad Pro and have been impressed with the speed I hope this iPhone is somewhat close 
I was going to get the 14 until realizing it wasnt much better than my 12 pro so I just held onto this until now"
            
Pointless phone 
I think titanium has a stronger weight to strength ratio not so sure its stronger though
No one has ever explored the downsides to fast charging and it seems no one ever will People just blindly believe its a free lunch and complain about not having it without reservation The most basic issue is heat generation which lowers the lifespan of the battery The extremely fast charging Chinese phones have their batteries split in all sorts of strange configurations to achieve that speed reducing usable space and therefore reducing actual capacity Android phones in general have wild battery runoffs and inconsistencies because of the hodgepodge way the system is designed so an Android at 20 is far more anxiety inducing than an iPhone at 20 Rumor also has it that the A17 Bionic is only about 10 faster than the A16 not because it isnt capable of being more powerful but because Apple has chosen power efficiency over mindless benchmark scores This is probably down to the reduced case size and larger elements like the bigger camera units which means less space for the battery Apple prioritizes battery to the point they will actively throttle their already overpowered chip in order to meet a certain battery life threshold They are not gonna bother adding FAST charging unless theres negligible impact to the rest of the sytem This is not unique to them Samsung has faster charging but not significantly so They are not pushing 100W like some of those dubious Chinese phones which are all specs and little practicality You want your phone to last for at least five years no Without it dropping below 50 battery capacity
Lol wtf  USB 2 speed  thats screwing with customers 
UE told them there is no USB C there is no business in UE  end of story
14 Pro Max probably my last IPHONE It does not reflect the price anymore
Marques Brownlee Do you know why the 14 Pro and pro Max have been taken down from the apple website
Titanium isnt necessarily stronger than steel Ti is often very brittle and is best used for lightweight or high temp applications
My iphone 8max is still working great Big yawn on these new iphones
Same old outdated iPhones if this was Samsung MKBHD wouldve Rip them apart the bias is real
I only use lighting for charging and my gaming controller that allows me to play and charge through at the same time and also doest waste battery on BT So no thanks USBC
Watching on my 14 pro and not changing for another year
Lol why are there only two camps of people I fit into neither  I do care and am generally interested in the upgrades and how everything turns out but Im not definitely getting one as Ill just stick to my lastyears Pro
Thanks for your hard work and research Its always appreciated I feel I can rely on you for the truth each time Really appreciate your content 
Anybody else start nodding when its just him in the frame
Can someone please tell Tim Cook to include a software update that allows for a close all applications feature I dont think its too difficult to ask asking for me and for my girlfriend
Now that I know its just a USB C port I am in camp dont care at all I may switch to the new Google 8 Pro after I see their announcement Ive had numerous issues with my iPhone 14 pro max
Samsung had that portrait mode before and after thing  since s10 lol
"Congrats man 

Lets talk about it"
Yet people will still buy it 
These finally look like premium phones again Older iPhones looked tacky especially those glossy ones
Cant wait for apple to drag their feet a few more inches and do USB4
Marquees lowkey flaming apple the entire video 
Omg its got 3 cameras and a charging port android has had for who knows how long Im going to buy it asap bro
U R the best in this field Thank you  appreciate what you do
Apple  Need To Cut That BS Out Same Damn Phone Im Str8 With My 14 Pro MAX 
Ordered the pro max this morning and despite everyones opinions Im excited It will be a huge upgrade from my 12 pro max Too many of you fail to realize that the majority of users do NOT buy the new model every single year
The captions dont match the audio of the video
Thanks European Union
Whats wrong with the subtitles though
TBH super big w for apple for making their brand new iphone 15 a Type C BIG W
They are clueless right now 
How does it feel in the hand The 14 pro max had such sharp sides that made it really uncomfortable to hold in the hand without a case Is the 15 pro max more comfortable to hold caseless
Apple caters to gullible people Android has had almost everything they boast for years
People consumer are addicted iphones  are the fentanyl and Apple is the Cartel
Same shit presents in new way is apple policy
type c is prone to wearloose faster than lightning
Im in camp Care but my 12 Pro is still great and I dont see enough new in the 15 to make me want to upgrade So maybe Im more accurately in camp Meh
A companys biggest new feature is whats been standard on other phones for years and its being sold as if its something revolutionary
in that case should we upgrade from 14pro to 15 series
The USBC change is great because one less cable I have to bring with me when I travel but if Im being honest the main reason I am upgrading Those brushed titanium rails Im anticase as well and the constant fingerprint nonsense makes me crazy crazier
"APPLE Look we just came out with USBC charger Arent we awsome
Iphone sheeps Woooow this is the greatest thing ever invented"
"I bought a Samsung S23 Ultra this year so Im not due for an upgrade for a long time

But If Apple develops that action button so you can program single press double press and maybe a capacitive touch control to swipe up and downmy next phone will be an iPhone

The functionality that would be possible with one button is insane and its crazy to me that most Apple users are so resistant to change that they actually dont like this update"
Ill stick with my 14 plus just got it a month ago yes its nearly a year old but loving it massively battery is sick last me all day and Im typing this at 2130pm uk time had it from 515am and still on 57 thats amazing Ill miss the 15 and probably wait for 16 maybe 17
Bro your captions are messed up
So another year of added features Samsung had 4 years ago But people only buy android phones from Walmart
The thing is what the fuck do I now do with all my lightning cables which are going to be EWaste if I would buy the new stuff
Slight improvements and small changes on mobile HUGE CHANGES ON PRIZE ONLY
On behalf of all Android users around the worldWelcome
Why are the CC completely different from the voice over
apple is so good at brainwashing you to upgrade
 800 iphone with 60hz screen 
About time Now just gotta wait a decade more for sdcard capabilities 
thanks for asking
Somehow im more interested in the normal 15 Plus phones and not so much in the pro Phones Ive had a 14 Pro Max for a little bit over half a year Im kind of bored Though Im gonna get both the normal 15 Plus and the 15 Pro Max phones this year
Man I didnt expect that from you promoting iPhone 15 flagship in 2023 with 60hz display come on and you said Samsung note 20 was worst phone because of 60hz you must have get paid from apple
People dont waste your money on this its the same shit every year If you have 12 1314 just keep that
Audo doesnt match transcript Will use autogenerated for this one
Ordered a 512GB iPhone 15 Pro Max so thats goodin white too since flying drones I find the lighter colors heat up less quickly which then leads to that annoying force dimming  And the added nits brightness hopefully will be good too
This upgrade was underwhelming Apple isnt even trying to innovate anymore They are just look at what they can unbundle and turn into an add on
Boring new iPhone
imagine this video droped randomly back in 2012
i dont  know why people gives a shit about apple  despite the fact that it is stealing them
iPhone always says every year  its faster  boring next
Iphone 15 reminds me of the iPhone 13 I personally think smartphones have plateud Apple will add a few advancements but barrow a style from the past because you can only change the design so much
So happy that apple finally came up with this innovative USBC pro thing 
should i upgrade my iPhone 12 PM to the regular 15 or would 15 pro be better
Using my iPhone 6s to view this  like hello 15 Welcome
"The captions file uploaded is all messed up
Please fix it"
I have a 2nd gen SE so looking forward to the 15 Pro this year Itll be a massive upgrade for me
Hey  where can I get the wallpaper from the preview of the video  Thx
the advancement of Apples iPhone line up is like squeezing toothpaste last time I recall a company act like that was Intel which got kicked butt big time by AMD and Apple I have iPhone 12 Pro Max and I have no interest to upgrade to this years lineup
I have the 13 Pro and have pre ordered the 15 Pro both non Max versions Most of the main changes happened in the 14 Pro
Well yes we are getting the 15 promax two of them We have the 11th now and I have the 11 Pro but because of the telephoto lens Im getting the promax 15
the only reason I can think of is they dont add the fast charging bc the batteries arent the best ones with many constumers complaining about the decent drop in 1 year
I want to charge while plugging something in
Ive been watching MKBHD for years But now Im 100 convinced that he and Mr Whose The Boss are on Apples payroll You guys never call Apple out for their terrible practices and price gouging Such a shame but you guys have lost all credibility and should be ashamed to call yourselves tech reviewers
sooooo  Android from a few years ago
No Im not here for usb slot on iPhone
Hey i live in Rwanda i could be greatful if you gave me  one i phone
I will wait till iPhone 18 releasing next year
Wish he would have mentioned apple was basically forced to using type C by EU and not something they really wanted
Guess ill stick with my 12 Pro Max for the meantime
I am proud that I have never bought an iphone
Imma pass no upgrade for me this year 
It looks like the same Iphone except for Type C integration It is a really progress for Apple but some people think that is the end of the era of traditions Apple In my opinion it is a new vector of companys development which can include a unique experience of interacting with UI for the avarage person
I wont be buying any of the new iPhones this year I have the 14 promax and updating to the 15 promax makes no sense at all
Im so embarrassed for Apple What a joke The same phone is being released over and over Apple sheep need a reality check
Sorry guys but the nee Iphone looks the same and feels the same I will jump to the S24 Ultra cuz a little bit larger than the Iphone 15 Pro Max Right now I have the Pro Max 13
Even if its USBC i can guarantee that it wont work with random usbcharger like the ipads etc
Fyi your captions are from a macbook video
Is the SAME   
I think iphone users deserve the desrespect they receive from apple
I will keep my 14pro  Thanks
"All you guys its the same phone as last time
Also you guys buys product immediately"
So are your reviews gonna be honest after getting mentioned by Tim Cook
60 HZ screen rate for 15 Why havent you talked about that Mkhb
Just buy samsung
There is really nothing different in iPhone 15 which requires a 20 minutes video to talk about it  really
Can they just make an iPhone pro but with no fancy camera Unnecessary price increase for average consumers I think
So in summary they added USBC and a Bixby button Well done Apple
Unfortunately in airplanes  it causes inconveniences Sheesh 
Wait Have you used iPhone 15 pro to shot this video 
Iphones are so lame lol
Apple never fails to disappoint us 
Once again apple falls behind samsung 
are the subtitles wrong for anyone
If Steve jobs alive apples ceo would get sacked less than a secondEvery year same phone and always behind galaxy
007 DUY THMMM
Sad that the only new big thing for a phone is usbc smh how much monies did you for giving a glowing review
Apple innovation is dead Awaiting on Elon to step in and make real innovation happen
One piece  104
Sounds underwhelming and not worth the upgrade to be honest Its not like we all dont already have lightning cables everywhere
60Hz refresh rate on non Pro phones that starts from 799 and 899 respectively You shouldve roasted them Its unfair that you did not mentioned that at all
"Oh wow Another video about a boring Apple product but again even the title is in a positive note Apple HAD to update to USB because of EU regulations Except for that is the same boring phone
iPhone 14 batteries are dying after only one year No comments on that huh"
How much LOL hard pass
My man you smashed it on the hands on the quality on your videos is getting better and better love the way you showed the iphones and you are right usb c has overtaken the smartphone market and it will the new iphones i saw on this video was like a i am watching a jewelry its so beautiful and i am hoping the price will go down after some time i love the blue color it justs give me hint of pacific and sierra blue altogether man its so good to see the pros get the good colors
Subtitles 
The best iphone ever
Apple schill
They increasingly get less impressive upgraded phones lol
Not just USB C Also an LG button that you can customize revolutionary extraordinary amazing 
USBC They had to do it due to European legislation and had no choice A hard pass on this one People are keeping their phones for much longer and this is the reason
As it was in the last decade same shit
646 theyll add it next year and say we have  a ground breaking new feature insert name charging by enhacing the colbalt particles down to the mirco level in our batteries with the power of usbc that we introduced in iphone 15 our engineers where disperse the lion particiles enabling iphone 16 pro to have up 45w charging this is truly a ground breaking system then we all clap and be like whoa finally 
10M
I dont trust this phone running games like resident evil 4 remake or death stranding at native resolution  ray tracing apple computers can barely game with a decent amount of fps using the same cpu but with faster ram and other components there is a catch there maybe they gonna use something like DLSS or FSR
Does anyone have an Iphone 15 How satisfied are you with the phone 
Same trash different container
550 apple will intentionally remove a hod back feature on their phones each year so dey can release it next year and make it a headline  We now have so so and so in our iphones and as alwasy everyone applauds them lol businesss guruss i am taking notes
The same  now boring  design  minor changes  every year the same shit
Apple had to go to USBc connector by eu laws
10 minutes talking about a USB C on a 13 min video yeahh the new iphone
48mp night mode
She should have made it both is usbc and lighting They could have easily created a port like that
Thanks Marques Im going to keep my 11 Pro Max for another year Im getting ios 17 so no need to upgrade to the 15
how this is still making news is beyond me it really is the emperors new clothes I pity those caught up in it
Dont buy it The EU regs with removable batteries are going to be when people should consider buying That happens end of next year 
yes
Did your Youtube team upload different subtitle to this video
I cant get over the usb2 speed
Super accurate government tracking with roadside assistance
Will i be able to use an iphone 11 case on the iphone 15 Are they the same sizes
Yo imagine the deafs have the cc on watching this video
This is a Joke Flying over for that
Welcome to the iphone 150000 that looks like the iphone released like 10 years ago with very incremental updates LOL
Im on the iPhone upgrade program so Im game to just get the new phone every year Definitely excited for the 5x telephoto and usbc I got the natural color
I think the english subtitles are not the correct ones
USB20 ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Blah blah Its boring 1difference every year is a crazy shit for the biggest tech company 
Same bullsh
    
anti consumer iphone slow usb speeds except for pro slow charging last years chip except for proregulate apple they can make a profit but it should be illegal to make a anticonsumer iphone
Wrong subtitle
USBC breaks easy Android user till a few months ago
subs are not timed properly
The thing for me is that I live the longevity of the iPhone When i idea andressiere phones I typically was dreading it after a year and super happy to upgrade after 2 years My iPhone 11 is still fine and if I hadnt cracked the display recently Id probably wait for the iPhone 16 but now Ill get the 15 this year and that will be a huge upgrade for me
I cant afford iPhone still watching this video 
Completely underwhelmed My 13 pro is still perfectly fine Im gonna pass
"heard think different
then  Wow amazing cool
now  emotional damage "
So youre saying I should trade in my 14 pro max 1tb I swear Im gonna make this phone last me a decade
"Ive never had an Apple product because the chargingdata transfering ports are always different I need a really good camera for work now so instead of getting the 14 I waited an entire year just to see if they actually put in a USBC due to the new EU law 
Im excited to say I just ordered first iPhone if you have the 14 or even an older one theres no reason to upgrade clearly From the 14 to the 15 other than the charging port and on the 15 pro max cameras its just a really expensive software update This will bring a lot of users over from Android OS devices plus they are not absurdly expensive compared to competitors like they were before"
Closed Captions are wrong Marques Brownlee please check
Just letting you know that youve uploaded the wrong subtitle track 
preordered the natural titanium pro max this morning which is odd because the black is my go to
Ram bhai sariya ne
Marques is right its 2023 and giving USB20 speeds for the non pros and limiting to just 20W charging this is just like having the coolest new shoes but on the condition apple ties your shoe laces together Bummer
check out the satellite phone of Huawei mate 60 pro
Apple celebrating nothing more than nonessential tech trash
955 to be clear he was not expecting it because it is not like Apple to give users so many options Not because it is an innovation
Why is the video caption saying something else and hes speaking something else both are not in sync at all  kindly check this I saw this like somewhere around 1minute 31sec onwards
most important all phones have type C iphone just caught up finally
720  the glass breaks not the frame  People are such sheep
Ahh yes Usb 20 incredibly outdated
As an Android user by seeing this video I feel like Apple is mocking its customers I mean you get USB 20 on base models and USB 30 on the upper ones hahaha thats just ridiculously funny
14 Pro Max owner says if the camera is better are the image sizes it stores bigger
I always upgrade every 23 years So I Preordered the Blue Titanium
Time to get nothing phone 2
I wonder if theyd ever bring back the mini I know some people who either have the mini or the se cause they dont like big phones
"I love that Apples about to rip off all their customers
I find it really funny that when this press conference came out everybody at my job besides the two people who had Androids were all talking about Im going to get the new iPhone yet not one of these people on their iPhone theyre all still making payment plans on it"
Im just a regular iPhone user the new upgrade dont pertain to me so I wont be getting the iPhone 15 this year See what happens next year
I think I might actually upgrade this timeits been 4 years
Looking forward to the iPhone 57 Pro Apple have ZERO creativity What does Apples RD department actually do All the recent iPhones practically look the same Disappointing Samsung release a new phone and the phone usually looks aesthetically different Cant you guys release an iPhone that folds a transparent iPhone an iPhone with a screen on the front and backfor goodness sake wheres the creativity At this rate Im going back to my old Nokia 3210 The future is definitely not bright Apple your new iPhone 15 is basically a mix and match of old technology and old features from previous phones Apologies for the criticism but I wouldnt be this annoyed with Apple if they didnt charge over 1000 for hardly any practical improvement The changes on the iPhone 15 do not add value to my me Theres additional value Im getting for the hefty price i have to pay for the phone No tangible benefit to me whatsoever
Is it me or are the captions all wrong
Who came from reels where he and his red are visible
Great so its the same damn phone Nothing new just USBC charging
I like the new silent button
"I cant believe the love that the tech youtubers are showering on apple for basically giving last years device with few basic upgrades enclosed in titanium frame How many of us have broken the frames of our phones
No 120 hrtz display on non pro models no USB 30 and the pro versions which have USB 30 not shipping them with data cables that support the same
I remember when z flip and fold were released he called the video samsung settled why the hypocrisy now"
Im watching these videos because Im a tech enthousiast But to answer to your last question No not getting one Slightly dissapointed in Apple for thinking so low about their customer base and how they can manipulate them at times At least we got to USBC
I heard it has no actual SIM slot just a eSIM bummer
Im a Apple supporter I have iPhone 14pro max AirPod pro MacBook Pro and Im annually disappointed on launch day New camera new design  basically nothing new  smh  apples yearly money grabs
"iPhone 16 now with fast charging

Apple praise us for introducing a feature other phones have had for years"
Is there bigdifference between 14pro and 15 pro
Wonderlust  
"0004 The new iPhone 15 comes with USBC port instead of lightning

0147 The new iPhone has a USBC port

0327 The iPhone Pro phone has a new portrait mode camera feature

0502 The Pro iPhones have upgraded USB 30 speeds with a new USB 3 controller while the base iPhones have USB 20 speeds

0650 The new iPhone design is lighter and has thinner bezels

0828 The new iPhone has a customizable action button on the side

1006 The new iPhone 15 Pro features improved cameras and USB is the biggest headlining new feature

1151 Anker has released a new lineup of USBC phone accessories for iPhone 15 including a compact Nano power bank"
Doesnt bother me at all why people make a fuss of the new iPhones is beyond me
Samsung has had a customisable action button for ages 
15 Wow Its like i blinked and missed something I swear just last year it was 8
Its the same shit every year Sony and Samsung are years ahead of of Apple I hate to say it but I do love Apple  its sad we are way behind
So default 12x would equate roughly to 33mm and 15x would be close to 40mm I actually can gig that since I shoot with a 35mm on my camera could actually use that for street photography
Hey mkbhd the subtitles are correct with the video
"Cmon dude is the same phone than past year and even the same as the IP13
A software update for portrait  for the base line IP a new button for the Pro models at 1300 USD and add a USBC gent 2 is not something to call innovation or new"
Who tf cares about iphones anymore
Apple always finds a way to screw its customers and they are all swallowing it
Please consider not buying a new phone every year You can buy a Fairphone with 10 year support and an easily replaceable battery Save yourself thousands and help look after the planet
What the hell there is an iPhone 15 out already
I guess they will release a 2TB later
Its the same phone except usbc Ill stick to my Google Pixel Pro
Well im upgrading from the iphone 8 so Think its worth it for me
Are Their Any Physical Sim For The 15 Pro Max Models 
wow  underwelming if im honest
1109 david looks like a silly goose standing there like that 
We are really in the minutae nowadays
From a user perspective yes it is just a port change
I have a 13 pro max and still not motivated to upgrade
Well coming from a base phone to base phone perspective I still dont think someone jumping from the iPhone 13 which is what I currently rock with NEEDS to get the 15 but if you want to mess with the Dynamic Island I dont see why youd not go for it 14 base didnt do anything to convince me to upgrade from my 13 to a 14 but the Dynamic Island upgraded camera USBC charger which would come in handy since I use a lot of USBC powered Bluetooth speakers but thats just me and A16 Bionic chip at least makes a case for why upgrading could be cool So Im on the fence On one hand at least its not an iPhone 13 repackaged again with a higher number 14 base was legit powered by an A15 like the 13 was a small upgrade from the Pros does not change the fact it was an A15 repeat iPhone 13 S rather than a 14
the subtitles are of a diff video bro
Well the 15 and 15 plus are actually 14 Pro models I might go for 15 Pro but still waiting for the review from you to see if it is really worth buying a 15 Pro or Pro Max In my opinion 15 Pro Max is not worth buying only for a 5X camera I didnt see much of a change there in 15 Pro Max So lets wait till you drop an indepth review
Might just wait till I get it from my company or wait till they dropped in price but for that price  ehh not that interested
When are we gonna get new iOS games lol
They literally changed nothing lmfao
Ill consider upgrading my iPhone 11  my cheap ass tries to avoid upgrading for as long as possible but my 64 gigabyte storage has been torture in recent years
Imagine being excited to spend 199999 on 5 year old android technology
So i guess IPhone still shit
LOL they need an event to launch this crap
Ill be happy when the next version comes with exchangeable batteries 
"Is it really possible that they dont offer fast charging even for the Pro or Max models It appears theyre capitalizing heavily on individuals ensnared within their ecosystem  its astounding Currently I am using an iPhone 13 Pro Max driven by my curiosity to assess Apples trajectory over the past 510 years and I am taken aback by the performance of this device which has not yet reached its third year of existence Ive been concurrently employing it alongside my Poco F3 Pro and since designating the iPhone as my primary device Ive encountered vexations concerning performance and compatibility I yearn for the effortless swipeback gesture found in the Android environment and applications do not operate as seamlessly as they do on my Android handset It is worth noting that my evaluation remains entirely objective as Ive consistently harbored admiration for both the phones design and its operating system My journey with iPhones commenced 1415 years ago when the initial iPhone emerged a device that bore no comparison to its contemporaneous competitors But I digress

After over three months of usage my discontent with the iPhone is absolute An important note is that it comes equipped with only 2GB of RAM resulting in suboptimal performance when subjected to diverse workloads In light of this I am compelled to assert that I shall never again procure an iPhone It is essential to grasp the contrast with my Poco Xiaomi phone which despite minor setbacks such as intermittent app crashes or a predisposition for the charging port to accumulate dust at an accelerated rate cost me a mere 300 Remarkably this device featured 8GB of RAM and was acquired merely six months following its initial release Conversely the iPhone 13 Pro Max commanded a price tag of 800 a matter that warrants substantial consideration In summary the challenges I encountered with my Xiaomi device were trifling particularly in light of the exceptional value it delivered characterized by 8GB of RAM a Snapdragon 870 processor and 40W fast charging capabilities via cable My astonishment is thus directed toward those who earnestly contemplate acquiring an iPhone in the year 2023 To those who have yet to embark on the Apple journey I proffer a word of caution As for those who have already embraced the Apple ecosystem one might conjecture that they are either exceptionally affluent or possibly not making the most judicious financial decisions"
camp dont care at all here
Tf is wrong with captions lol
The subtitles are wrong it seems to be about macbook instead of iPhone
Banned in France for excessive unsafe Radiation Agitates the Graphene in the vaxxed
why doesnt apple add multitasking to iphone Would be a killer feature
You didnt say anything the whole video
Its about time they switched to USB enough with the proprietary accessories its been what 20 years You ask around for a charger and people either have or dont have itfinally you ask and boom eveeyone has a charger
Go For iPhone 14 Pro series or iPhone 15 Pro series if you want to upgrade X 11 or 12 No point for regular 15
Waiting for 16 currently on the 12 4 year change cycle
bro its only usbc because of regulations so nothing new at all
Am going to keep my iPhone 14 pro max for now until iPhone 17 comes out 
The subtitles are from another video Very confusing to watch without sound
I thought it would be better  still have iphoneX
You know they could make thous buttons slide out like Tesla car long ago so I dont record some random audio and pictures in my pocket
Is the camera module size same as 14 pro
The mute button gonna be a hot topic I often miss clic on my pocket the volume button when go inout so the mute switch was the most reliable button i ever experienced Bad its removed
The check from this video is gonna be so fat
Im just excited to be able to borrow someones charger
Now please tell us Why dont you have a case
I will stay with Iphone 12 no need to upgrade as there is nothing new here plus my phone is still working good My last upgrade was from Iphone 7 to 12 Apple is the worst comapny when it comes to upgrading its product I am sure they have more thing to add to this Iphone 15 but they will hold it till next realease
So iPhone has finally caught up to 8yo Android phonesCongrats
All this talk about phone materials when most people use cases is baffling
Mate it would greatly enhance your videos if you incorporated stylish animations or text graphics similar to what Mrwhosetheboss does Although youre already quite popular making your videos more viewerfriendly is important Continuous talking without any visual enhancements can become monotonous and timeconsuming in todays fastpaced world
Action button is so dumb i mean there is the double tap option tapping on the back of your iPhone that gives you the ability to choose every thing you want
"Remember YouTubers complaining about the 60hz display on a 400 phone pixel 6a 

After Apple announcement YouToubers We dont do that anymore with a 900 phone"
"Is it only me or did you notice reading the caption and hearing what he says were different Basically I got 2 videos with one video

Thanks for Posting"
fast charging will come in iphone 16 pro max then wireless charging between airpods and iphones will come in iphone 17 pro max 
FYI  the captions for this video are messed up  seem to be from a different script
Non techies will say not to upgrade to Pro and Pro Max models from prior models but when you dive into the specs you see a lot has improved
For me 20 w charger is enough I mean u nearly have all day battery life then u can charge your iPhone at night  whats the need of more charging speed  Only in case you forget to charge so theres come the role of power banks
Subtitles seem to be for a different video
I ordered one not because I expect any new awesomeness but because my 2nd 12 Pros top speaker went out  Maybe I will be pleasantly surprised  Id leave the ecosystem if I wasnt already a slave to it
subtitles dont match
Idk if I would be upgrading since I have the 12 May go to the 14  for the better life but other than that Im going to hold out for the iPhone fold Hopefully it will come out in a year or two who knows 
Its wild they come out with something every year even if its not that impressive
hey the captions are way off btw
Not just USBC but overpriced aswell  Not even 120hz screen and its Q42023 
Plenty connector changes MagSafe 1 to MagSafe 2 to USBC to MagSafe 3
Nothing innovative same as 14
Cc mistake
Just ordered my 15 pro max today Cant wait to get it
FYI the subtitles are wrong mkbhd
I literally just night the 14 pro max yesterday ughh should I return it and wait for the 15 lol
Its useless to update  no improvement deserve to purchase it
Me waiting for iPhone 16 m still with 13
I hope there are no WSOD or white screen fckin freeze  Hey Tim please checkout this problem the phone was expensive but the quality hmm
Its such a  disappointment lol
Only USB 20 does that mean there is no video out
Its an iPhone 14s thats it if you have an I phone 14 you dont need to buy this one that portrait mode photo shit have been on Android for like 2 or more years now
Look the same like iphone14  but its 2023 who the fuk use iPhones when the market its full with way better and cheaper
MedMen Stock Running Up Now Health Services Directing DEA to Reschedule Marijuana Buy MedMen Stock today  Mmnff
Its the iPhone 14 but with usb port and dynamic island for all 
I think I will wait I have the 13 pro max and theres isnt enough change the only thing smaller but big at the same time is the usb c port other than that I dont game dont take to much photos so I hope next year they take of the dinamic island or make something more exciting more screen or something like that
wait a sec I can also capture on simple mode in my Google pixel and turn it into portrait mode after capturing so NextGen Portrait are that Sorry if someone can explain how it is diff from it
Doesnt the pro have 35 wats now
"EU FORCED APPLE TO USE USBC
they wouldnt have done it if they werent threatened to be BANNED in the EU"
Still no 10X periscope lens which has been in many phones for years sometimes with great results
Lightening was in fact a more sturdy connector where as USBC can get a bunch of shite inside the female connector Oh well 
No innovation happening in Apple except versions of same old phone  Parody videos on Apple are better than Apple features in new phones 
Did he say its noticeably lighter Isnt it literally a single gram lighter
Almost 10 million views in 2 days Regardless of whether the iPhone 15 is good its good for MKBs bank account  Respect King
Meh
I think losing the 3x for a 5x is not a good thing for portraits since its too tight
Apple is dying 
The apple era has come to the end back when Steave Jobs died
preordered my 15PM from XS MAX
I preordered mine because my 12 is trash and barely plays any sound and Im due for a upgrade
2b
Is it worth upgrading from the 13 pro
Camp skipping I hate the iPhone 14 pro camera compared to the 11 Pro will definitely be waiting until they change cameras
These new iPhones MID CENTRAL
"Iphone what to make them buy new we dnt know what to do
i know we place C charger case aluminium and maybe lock butt yeeey

So u got same shit every year people r just  idiots to buy and buy"
Every year Apple consuming people the same thing with higher prices
When will they actuallymake something elsenot skim the apple users of money every year
Bring back the mini please
Just preordered the iPhone 15 pro in natural titanium these are huge upgrades to me since Im coming from a iPhone 11 Pro
So bored with the iPhone Literally boring af No REAL useful day to day use innovations Blah
I have an iPhone 12 close to 4 years old at the moment does it make sense to switch to the 15 Pro or 15 Pro Max
Keep in mind that if youre circle of friends use iPhone youre going to find yourself with the cable sharing problem until everyone upgrades to iPhone 15 
No in display camera What is the difference between 15 and 14 then Price Just slight tweak and upgrade meh
Nice video But can you please just get to the point why do I got to wait till later in the video to see it
I want mini version
Did they add new ring tones  or new wall paper
60 hz 
No real innovation from apple anymore They just take ideas from other developers and make it their own But hey you get a new color and screen size
My 11 pro max is still a great phone Nothing about the 15 makes me want to get it
Should I upgrade from my iPhone 8 Plus
Did you put on the wrong CC We love the new MacBook Air and the entire Mac lineup  046
Same ole phone different charger
Apple had to put the USBC on their phone because the European government This phone I feel was rushed and you can tell I mean this video was only 15 minutes No real new features to talk about but people are going to spend the 1400 because they need it
I cant stand Apple Shit is old already
Marques wondering why Apple does not give us the basic technology every other phone industry does Its like wondering if the water is wet 
Your video has just popped up on my YouTube and I am here to ask yoh  ARE YOU SINGLE 
Omg 12 k usb c nice jom apple
The only reason for USBC on iPhone is well theyre forced by the EU Thats all And thats why there are no more features like fast charging or many other advantages of the USBC port Just forced by the EU regulations
Im done with Iphone Just a waste of money All the attachments are scams for you to keep buying their products Tired being a sucker like the other Appleheads Idiots buy the phone for the Camera Just to take silly phots of their foodlol
Thank god they got ride of the stainless on the sides I can hold my phone with out a case and not hate life
Its the same fucking phone since the 11 Almost zero inventions They could release a new phone every 5 years this would be enough
So they just added C port and a new button
subtitles seem not on the correct track
"Ill be one to say I do not care about nor want fast changing 
Battery longevity is already enough of a problem I dont want to introduce fast charging only to further reduce battery life"
"Title Not only USBC
Almost all of the video shoots showing the port"
I am waiting for an iphone which is working with satelite internet Till that time I wont buy a new iphone
Can any Apple simp here explain to me what exactly is the breakthrough innovation this time
We want Matlock
Damn I was hoping there would be 5 cameras on this model  I need 5 cameras  I wish they would drop the phone capabilities and add a few more cameras
The action button performs almost the same function as the Back tap
Baseline 10th gen iPad is already USBC
Im still getting the new iPhone anyway but its really nothing exciting or innovative
"TBH I didnt really think much of the change to USBC We all knew it was coming for a long time now The biggest announcement that caught my attention was the Pro models new GPU and the AAA games that are coming to iPhone iPhone  Backbone which has been updated for 15  Potentially a real competitor to the Switch Ally Steamdeck etc now I think in terms of raw horsepower its going to leave them all in the dust and will do it with far lower power consumption

The action button is hilariously badly implemented at least initially Having to choose only ONE action is moronic They needed to add multiple options like double tapping triple tapping etc that would do more things I want the silence setting to be there but I want to ALSO use it for other things Giving up the quick silence means its a dealbreaker for any other potential setting What an absurd oversight"
I almost wish I still sold phones so I can see the older people of the world come in and say somethings wrong with my iPhone because they accidentally held that action button down
The new design 
Still rocking the 13 pro max Give it another 23 years to see if they introduce some must have features
if you know someone who gets a new iPhone every year or who gets one every other year you my friend know a sheep and a very insecure person
Why not keep the iconic mute button and just add the action button Makes way more sense to me Way more then enough room for it
No screen update
1000 getting a pro since im still limping around with an XR thats constantly burning up but cant decide on the pro or pro max i dont have huge hands but extra phone and screen size for movies and games will be sweet HELP ME DECIDE
15 pro max in that raw titanium looks NUTSSSS
And the more base models using USB c is using old old USB tech  Slow slow  Only the pros is getting the better USB  Bummer
Still no reason to switch my XSMAX
Its essentially the same phone as the 14  The 3nm is only a 10 increase One would think just by default it would be 10 and optimized properly another 10 or 15  Minimum of 25 to 30  But only 10 Love the way it looks and gorgeous screen but they didnt do enough for me S23ULTRA is better and is a year old  24 will destroy it
Whens the new ipod nano dropping
Ohh wau new iphone got new things which we allready have in android phones for few years Yeyy  achh apple
Seems like Id youre not planning to travel to space and youre not making silver screen action movies theres no real reason to upgrade
"Yeah Ill buy this in 2 years when the price is reasonable maybe


So sad huawei has no google anymore They were the best phone value hands down"
leading edge
They only added usb c 	to their  phone beause of EU legislation stating all mobile devices must use a common charging cable
No major changes Stick with ur 14
Dont you know why apple usbc is because EU banned lightning cables in Europe iPhone 12 banned in France because too much radiation dont you know iphone 15 is made in India Are you a Marketing influencer
Team Camp waiting for the next phone while I hold on to my 13 pro max
The innovations from Apple feels so overrated
So its just USB C then
I got it already that what Im typing on ima come back and download my fave game
Great camera but the best pictures of life are made in your head Latest phone wont make a difference 
Lets be real 80 of apple fanboysgirls will buy it because it says 15 now instead of 14 Thats their main selling point
"Think Ill stick with my iPhone 11 for another year Unless it mysteriously starts losing battery power within an hour of use
Hopefully well see improved usb c on the next iPhone"
Is it worth to trade in an iphone 13 pro max 128gb to get a new iphone 15 128gb
"Well FINALLY

To answer your question M I am firmly in the camp of buying this  Pro Max

Im not so worried that its just a repackaged 14

I Didnt buy the 14 and was ready to shift over to Android if the 15 didnt have USBC

I am certain a huge chunk of people didnt buy the 14 for the same reason Why would you You knew it was coming so why would you buy a phone with an obsolete cable interface

Its not so much that the 15 is razzle dazzle new Its the 14 a year late

This will be the biggest selling iteration to date Mark my words

I know you are not excited about it but Apple just saved their market share with that single feature imho

I think perhaps you and most certainly Apple have completely underestimated the global hatred of those lightning cables

Fast charging would have been nice but I charge mine while I sleep so not a biggy"
Im probably going to get one because my 13 Pro I paid off and the trade in value is so high that Ill get the new phone for about half price Maybe less Its not that exciting of an upgrade but I am pretty hype to get last years features 2 years combined make it feel like a more worthwhile upgrade
For pro phone they have introduced faster data speed with type c and added pro chip because they may later introduce stage manager for iPhone where you can connect iPhone with monitor  use it like Mac something like Samsung dex and they will limit this feature to only pro users because they are apple
You can thank the EU for USBC move I think its about time forcing everyone to buy apples cables was a joke lighting cable is crappy and a big joke I wont be getting an Iphone I thought about it Im getting tired of googles crap hardware  might just be going back to samsung  Defenetly getting a new phone Ill see what pixel 8 brings but not having high hopes for it But at least the 8pro will have UW band Love apple hardware but not gonna lie not a fan of apple os
I wonder how much radiation they emit
Next change Android os
Is it just my video or does the auto generated closed captioning not match what hes saying
yeah introducing the same shit again
USB 20 LOL No fast charging Are you kidding LOL
Iphone 15 usb 20 2010 technology today Utter garbage
It is  still the same phone as IPhone 14 USBc is not new for  iPhone 14 You can charge your 14 partial usbc cable
Only reason apple did this is because of a law suit By 2030 theyll have removable batteries
Stop feeding apple
60hz display and no fast charging 
Thank you so much for this video I think Im just going to get the iPhone 14 pro at this point
"Title Not Just USBC
Video Nothing that would be more exciting than USBC Which is a bare minimum  enforced by UE

I dont want to be one of the blind Apple haters But honestly since IPhone 11 and 12 I find it hard to get excited about new releases no innovation no cool new features Remember times when 6 was an entirely new thing from 5"
Really struggling to pick between which shade of gray I want
Im in another campCamp too bloody expensive as usual
iPhone is no longer leading its just trying to catch up with its competitors
Honestly going to be the same as 14 pro If you upgrade from 14 pro youre either rich or enjoy wasting your money Only thing I want is that multifunction button other then that its a pass from me Great video as always Marques
I think Ill be sticking with my 13 pro max for as long as possible I usually upgrade every 2 years but I dont think itd be worth it for now
419
013 what could they possibly do Is exactly right The answer is nothing Its the same specs as the 14 pro max but slightly lighter Im pissed Give us a better camera even tho you can never tell when they upgrade the camera and better display Not even a few more pixels All we got was an extra core and titanium shell Cool I love apple and will forever stay loyal but Im disappointed we didn get any real upgrade Whatd they do all year
Great review as usual Marques
Personally the most interesting part was the full retail games like RE4 and AC Mirrage coming to iPhone I think Apple would never allow it but think of plugging a monitor into the USB C iPhone and have a console with a connected controller Will be interesting how the graphics compare to PS5 and XSX
Hoping Thunderbolt is in the plans for future pro models
who made these subtitles lmao
"Not concerned with the look of the iPhone because it will have a case on it I feel like that shouldnt be a huge focus
Highlight to me is the Action Button and the USBC port Both great upgrades"
How about iPhone 12 radiation news
How to waste your money 101
I am gonna say it from all now But you are truly a tech geek  a big one 
Apple boyhe surely knows how to hype iPhone and degrade android
when the f will Apple deliver more than the peoples expectations I ask whennnn
It sucks because USB c is terrible I prefer lightning AS A HARDCORE ANDROID FAN
The only OG on reviews
"Im yet to see real innovation in the iPhones 
Not impressed at all"
Can we please get away from making phones out of the most fragile thing we can think of Get away from glass go back to plastic Kevlar  ceramic teflon etc also lets go thicker give me battery life and a 12 thick phone please
Cash grab
Amazing The Pro Max will be my first smartphone
Hey whats up with the captions on the video I have captions enabled as a preference and the captions are not from this video
Apple 
am I the only one who sees totally unrelated or at least not applicable to the vid captions on this video
So its just same Iphone with USB and software updates
You could have honestly shown everyone an iPhone14 and just cover up the USBC port and no one would have known the difference
Same old shit every year
iPhone only has USBC because EU is requiring all devices have a common charger by next year This was not some innovation from Apple
so the biggest improvement is a port that is nearly a decade old magical
Substitles are different please send me a iphone15 promax
WAKE UP APPLE FAN BOYYYS YOU ARE GOING TO ANDROID ECO SYSTEM NEXT IPHONE 16 A AMAZING PUNCH HOLE poor apple LACK OF INNOVATION
pretty much you are paying 1200 euros for usb c
Markass Brownie
105 one piece
"Lets be honest the apple lightning cable was a CASH CROP for Apple Now  theyve been  BRAGGING  about USBC when this was forced by the European Union to reduce cable waste for all phone electronic manufacturers
This move was not because Apple wanted to save the Earth they were forced to do this by the European Union and they DIDNT want to make two cables one for the USA and one for the European Market"
iPhone meh
Are the subtitles incorrect for anybody else
Excellent go through Im sick of accidentally switching to silent mode so being able to customise it is great
The iphone 15 pro is really catched my eye especially that new A17 pro and the ability to play tripple AA games natively its just mindblowing im gonna wait to see gameplays and reviews then i will decide either to go for the pro or stick with my 12 pro max for now
the action button should have more than one customizable option like two taps three taps one tap and one long press
I think the closed captions are from a different video
This is a disappointing phone stop selling out 
The captions and the voice isnt matching help
Android is king
they are saving fast charging for the Iphone 30
Bro your captions are messed up it is taking about MacBook and you are speaking iPhone
Apple are never going to win more buyers from Android systems unless they takea giant leap Jobs must be turning in his grave at this monotonous incremental change every year
action button lol i had that on my black berry bold almost 13 years ago
When is the release date not the pre order date
ohh great Im still watching the video even though Ive never have one apple products
Theres no difference between the 14 pro and 15 pro just the usb lmao
"Notch


A nooooootch"
Only folding phone can save apple or else its just going to be the same thing every year
Why youre seeing this can you afford this 
Watched a ton of videos on the new phones prior to ordering This one was the most informative Thanks
im a software engineer and i barely know what features are on my iphone 14 pro I dont think id use any of these features on the 15
Such an underwhelming release
Made in China
FYI the CC are not correct for some reason
Unbelievable ALL the phones arent 120100 hz
am broke donate me phone
Is anyone gonna mention the CC being from abother video
We know you secretly work for apple
They arent actually titanium rails but rather aluminium veneered with titanium if I understand properly I think it would interesting to know whats the actual thickness of the titanium vs the aluminium on those rails Most probably a task for jerryrigeverything
Marques youre trying so hard to give  the reasons why this is not a Samsung S7 phone covered with iPhone All these terms  pro high shieldyadayadayada bro its still the same old phone with typec trying to so much not to be Samsunggood jobanyways
Im keeping my 14 pro max No need to upgrade Waiting on the iPhone 16
The backtap feature on the current iphone already does what the action button does Click a button or tap the back twice i am still getting the same feature Kinda feels redundant to me
The side button and camera picture size customization tipped me over the fence to upgrade iPhone 11 Pro Max to I phone 15 pro max
i think someone uploaded the wrong caption file to this video i am getting cc for macbook
im interested to know what percent of iphone users use max brightness most of the time For me i rarely use max brightness so it feels useless to just keep making the display brighter
the biggest feature is that they HAD to change to usbc they literally had to and thats all they did
The customisable button is great but USBC is long overdue and theyve only changed it because they were forced to Thanks but no thanks Apple still happy with my 1
Okay but the button is useless if it only does one if the options at a time
its just me or the captions are broken
Waste of money Ill keep my 14 pro max my 12 pro was just fine I just needed better quality camera and I already got that apple aint stealing my money this year  sike i probably buy a apple watch cuz im still on the series 6 but thats it
The price Im sure is crazy high Im still using my 6 plus I see no reason to keep spending money on all this bs
WHY CANT THEY MAKE THAT PINK IN A PRO MAX Damn Tired of these masculine man colors for the Pro Max 
You dont charge a mac with type c
Lol people still over paying for a phone
"Apple should say the real reason bhind the usb switch
Its because the eu forced there hand and apple wasnt going make 2 versions of the iphones one for eu and one for the rest of the world"
I always try to go for the odd numbers but Im excited Ill get the 15 pro max
"That cusrom side button uswith Samsung had it Formally Bixby if we didnt want her we can use the button for other things then the button slowly went away wasnt needed 
And apple still doesnt have a back button home button Bing up all your old pages ypu been looking at and one press they are all removed
My s23 ultra takes amazing photos still better than Apple"
Im confused The text that is displayed in the video doesnt even remotely match what Marques is saying Whats up with that
lemme just start off by sayin if u put the ads on that u cant skip or block ur weird
So no real upgrade or reason to buy it just that its the newest one
As usual Apple always playing catch up to Android The Samsung S8 had USB C back in 2017 lol SIX YEARS AGO
Remember guys when we all thought the iPhone 5 would be transparent
One day  even my youtube channel and video will become viral
Official representer of sell out Tech YouTubers Besides the USBC the changes from the 14 Pro are marginal and totally not worth it the upgrade unless you have an IPhone older than the 12 Keep it real and transparent
Love all the hype of all the people showing up to see Apple provide something Ive had for years  
Bang coba buat ekspor video jedag jedug alight motion 60 fps
545  I dont know when the last time you plugged your phone in was made me laugh harder than I would expect
So bummed to see they give up on the mini Still the best iphone ever made imo
Huawei mate 60 is better
Iphone who z fold 5 is the best phone on the market and for the years it comes
Well theres nothing new only USB C Good luck Apple fans 
Wow over 9 million views Apple is so innovative with using new USBC technology
Theres a whole new different story going on in the subtitles
Where is sideloading
when the closed captioning doesnt match the vid
"Iphone XS here still dont feel the need to upgrade for my day to day usage but if I do I would probably go with a refurbished 13 pro for the sake of battery life Plus it would fit my personal budget better 

Exciting to see your pull quote this go around youre just the person Apple should be getting feedback from"
Surreal to see usb c really  come on mkbhd  apple must be paying a lot for the promotion
How will Marques sell us 60hz display on iphone 15 i am really curious about that  because 60hz display was the biggest problem on google pixel 6a which is half the price 
Very below average changes are not worth the upgrade from what it looks like
Really wish they would build a phone that doesnt require a case I could careless about a 48MP camera and it being 10 faster The phones are gorgeous but always have to have a case to protect against broken screen
So many youtubers have to spend a lot of time to justify this old win in a new bottle So let the iphonery begin 
So So So Nice  You just made my mind Im getting a ROG 6 Actually was gonna get it from the beginning
So basically Im good with my 13 they just made small changes to make people buy from them  I love Apple but Im not buying a new one for a while unless they make bigger changes 
Conclusion nothing new in iPhone 15 Stick with your current phone
Upgrading from the iPhone XR to a 15 Pro Excited for USBC and at this point basically everything My XR has lasted well but the battery camera and load times for most appsfunctions is too slow
Only Apple can make USBC a highlight feature in 2023
Its a shame it took a European ruling for USBC rather than Apple you knowmaking sense
Have the notifications gotten better That plus USBC might finally get me to move from Pixels
"iPhone 15 3349mAh
iPhone 15 Plus 4383mAh
iPhone 15 Pro 3274mAh
iPhone 15 Pro Max 4422mAh"
So looks like me and my 14 pro max are sticking together for a few more years till theres something with the upgrade
having 14 Pro Ill wait for the 16 Pro
lets be clear iphone 1515 plus are just iphone 14 pro14 pro max but without one camera and ProMotion display thats all
Ive currently got a 13 pro max and this 15 pro max dont seem worth for for me to spend 1200 maybe next year 
USBC is BAD its not durable for basic dally use like charging the phone at the car keeps breaking in almost all my devices even my laptop and no Im do not buy cheap no brand cables
Aminin aja dulu 
Honestly how long are people going to keep buying the SAME phone over and over again Apple is literally so far behind and the laziest company ever 
"Not just usb c lol cmon Marques  The iPhones havent been truly innovated upon in so long and its getting to be a sad story at least for myself As you said you cant even utilize the usb c download speed on 15s so might as well still be lightening How do ppl get excited about the iPhone nowadays These incremental updates are such a bore so lets be honest it is just USB c Why not be honest I stay apple bc the ecosystem but its getting painful

Ps Congrats on getting mentioned at the event"
"Making this video must have been the hardest one in your channel
You were trying so hard to find something new that you had to mention the corner radii 34 times
The videos title should have been So android has been doing it right all along"
Nice review but Im sticking with my Galaxy Ultra
Theres literally nothing new
This just says sell apple stock  
About time for this connector but I wont replace my 14 for several years  I maximize my money out of these purchases  See you at iphone 20
"old man here I have seen so many tech products that changed everything but
are no longer sold Beepers Answer machine car phone  and so on you with imaginations
and young will laugh as I do when you see what made all smartphones obsolete"
If you cant afford money for iphone 15 dont make excuses Iphone 15 is best phone thn 11121314 
Not just usb c usb c is a brand usb c is man of the smart people the people of usb c they are very smart i love usb c
The facts that they havent went up to 120Hz its just criminal
"The USBC change happened because the EU regulations demanded it otherwise Apple wouldnt be allowed to sell their phones in Europe

Thats why youre disappointed its not supposed to be anything else than what everybody else has Thats the point"
The exhaust and headers on my motorcycle are titanium and after awhile from the heat the titanium changes a beautiful purple blue v colorThat would be cool if Apple comes out with a burnt titanium frame 
review huawei mate 60 pro plz
Same phone you u apple users keep jizzing over a lack of innovation
still waiting for iPhone 20 for a proper upgrade
"When they get fast charging for usb c and move over more accessories to usb c it will be more compelling then 13 pro max is still a workhorsebattery still solid 

If you are in the market I would get the 13 to save money or the 15 Skip the 14 which was riddled with issues do your googles"
iphone 5
European Union was not playing usb c or nothing
Paying more for less the iPhone experience
if they put fast charging in the iphone 15  how are they gonna sell you the iphone 16
Atleast show some courage to say No 
You know that manufacturers are really running out of ideas when they switch from stainless steel to titanium One thing that has never ever been an issue
Will they throttle non genuine usb c cables though
New iphone trash  they forgot how to create
Same phone new cable GOT IT yeah Im good lmaooooo
Apple put 2013 tech with 2001 specs in a 2023 device USB 20 C
"Is that true  from an Apple Forum

No it wont be the same quality On the 15 Pro Max 3x will be a crop digital zoom of the 24mm main camera sensor where on the 15 Pro 3x is optical zoom of the telephoto camera I use the 3x camera all the time currently because of the
77mm focal length of the current telephoto camera Its great for faces and portrait shots without adding distortion of facial features We shall see how the 5x optical zoom of 120mm telephoto camera looks on the new 15 Pro Max for portraits because I would not want to use the main camera and digital zoom to 3x for portrait shots on the Pro Max I cant imagine the quality will compete"
maturity is when you realize that this is the same damn iphone again
Im still using an iphone 11 I havent found any reason to upgrade to any of these 4 new models 4 generations before the iphone 11 was the iphone 7 just showing how much the iphones changed before compared to nowadays
i think phones have peaked for perfomance vs size so they just trying to squeeze every last drop of money by putting a new number on it
Usb C Thank you  slave masters
005 Meat Grinder by Madvillain Madlib and MF DOOM
Just preordered my 15 Pro Max in Natural Titanium
My 12 pro max is still killing it man
1400 is insane thats basically a gaming pc
It makes my iPhone 14 pro max a joke 
USB 20 in 2023 
The Apple  gods have spoken Thank you
To be honest this update does not have many highlights If Apple cannot continue to innovate it will definitely be surpassed by Huaweis technology
The closed captions for this video are totally off lol
The Euro Government demands that Apple and others only have one system usbc or else they may not sell the new products after 2024 only usbc products may come in Europe
To all of you people having issues with the lack of upgrades each year please tell me what else you could possibly need
The closed captioning is for a different video
what is Iphone  every year same phonewith high price
Not interested No real must have features Boring design Boring phone
Hey Marques I think u have messed up with your Subtitles
Same phone Ill keep my iPhone 12 pro Max
You mistakenly attached sneaky update videos caption to this one 
Totally getting the 15 Pro Max as I was waiting so long for the USB C since my IPhone XS Max Pro I am still using Happy to create content with the new one and enjoy everything soon Thanks for the video and your thoughts
TLDR If you have an iphone 14 Pro its not worth upgrading
Dude complains about spending 1k on the Dyson headphones a business writeoff mind you not out of pocket and then we see him flying definitely not economy class Ill never understand when rich people try to act like money is an issue
Its me or the CC is messed up
My only reason to get the iPhone 15 Pro was the 2TB storage    Sadly the 15 Pro didnt get it as expected  Sadly I wont be getting one   Will use the 13  14 Pro for another year  
Ill upgrade from last years SE to the 15 pro model great video thank you
About capturing the full depth for later editing Xiaomi has been doing that for years now even Redmi has it
apple slaves rushing to buy the same fucking thing for the 4th time
"Marques Brownlee lets do some math
I have not done the math so I am not sure if the math is mathing but this makes you think
According to a calculation by CNBC if you had invested the price of an iPhone every year in Apple stock since 2007 it would be worth over 367 million today
This calculation assumes that you would have held onto the shares for the past 16 years"
Its all good but I bought a new iPhone last year so Ive got to wait it out for a while
This USB C implementation all has to do with European Union regulation coming up which will make USB C mandatory  So its not Apple being good
The new retroactive portrait mode reminds me of those refocusing Lytro cameras
Can it download videos from a email
Phones are a great invention and iPhone are the best version of a phone Literally perfect smooth beautiful and easy to use RIP Steve Jobs 
Dislike for anyone who still promotes Apple garbage in 2023
"You are a fool if you buy the  newest iPhone  It always slightly upgraded So the fools go  Oooo look one more camera lens  me wanty

I have the 7 and its incredible We need phones to be phones  thats it"
My iPhone 13 Pro will be my phone for the next 10 years
same phone as three years ago
To expensive for what you get Ill stick with my 13 mini 
Will we get m2 iphone 
Hi
I cant believe apple went with 60hz for the 15 again
Cool iPhones finally have something other phones have had for years Way to be innovative Apple 
I think Im going to switch back to android Apple just doesnt seem to make many appealing updates for me and I dont care much about photography which they always seem to focus most updates on Only thing I like is the pink color Ill see what the next S24 brings before deciding
15 is 14 pro
Nothing new under the Sun
Subtitles dont match
It is good but dont think I will upgrade from my iPhone 14 Pro Max
Whats next  Samsung s24 ultra with lighting cable  
Radiation
23rd iPhone
I already found a thing to hate for in the IP15  USBC
You know Apple like to hold out on some of the products So 2016 or 2017 phone will have fast charging  Pure ridiculous
Boring release nothing special and USB being marketed as a great new feature when Apple was forced to implement it
The One Piece glass back What
That button reminds me Samsung s10 bixy button
Transcript not synced with the video
I really think this iphone is a waste of money if you have a 13pro max or 14 pro max already What a boring new iphone reveal
Us android users having to worry about iphone users jacking our USB cables on top of other android users just made me wince
Captions completely wrong
Hi someone else see the wrong subtitles it seems subtitles should begin at 020
It looks to me like they just modified the old stock iPhone 1314 a little to sold the old stock 
NOTHING NEW 
Isnt the USB 20 
Took them only 8 years  but hey They are there
Bruh Iphone still the same design
348 i used to do that portrait thing with HTC one M8
I wait 15 Pro Max Titanium 
So basically features but zero innovations but fanboys are squirting all over the place 
The new usbc was the only feature that appealed to me I think its finally time for a divorce with apple products
"iPhone announcement in 2008 WOW

iPhone announcement in 2023 Oh so anyway"
IMHO the only thing worth upgrading for is the camera for youtubers  content creators
Thanks EU for forcing apple to use USBC
I just bought a xiomi 11E pro 5g197 and it does everything I need including a 108mp camera
how the f this channels 480p quality looks like 1080p
60hz trash
Subtitles are off and i guess not from this video
I definitely need to upgrade my iPhone Im thinking about buying the iPhone 14 or 15 what do you think is the better deal considering the iPhone 14 is 150 cheaper i am not a gamer  or power user i plan on keeping yhe phone for 4 to 5 years
Another boring phone made by Apple
am i the only one here still rockin with the iphone 8
Apple back at it again releasing a 1200 phone thats basically the same usb c should have been added years ago 
Is anyone else not getting recommended MKBHD videos like they used to I keep having to actively search to find your videos and i wondering if google is suppressing your videos 
wow it only took apple 5 yrs to incorporated usbC boring
no fast charging speeds no 120hz display man I really wanna try to switch but does it worth it
The Iphone has become the most boring product even
Something happened with the subtitles  they seem to belong to another video 
No meaningful design changes features capabilities NOTHING Except higher price
"Now with USB can the phone be plugged into your homes router and be used as an internet source for when your homes wired internet is down in emergencies

Androids can do it"
There is nothing new just the change in colors This company does not have anything new
Running out of things to say
Yep something to be excited about usb c hahaha
Does the reg 15 carry a LiDAR sensor now as well
I am a Navy Reservist and travel pretty often because of it The USBC matters to me because I have a charger bag and having one charger to do it all is nice
just bokkkkkkka to buy new i phone
So basically no more of apple users flexing the borrow me an iphone cable 
So glad I got my 14 pro max back in June other then the action buttion nothing Im excited for and the home button or back tap takes care of that
So the replacement for the toggle switch on the iPhone is now a button that can now do what the lock button on my Galaxy phones can do just with an extra button I feel like they couldve taken notes from Samsung here where the dedicated Bixby button was a flop and they got rid of it  Dont get me wrong I like that they put some thought into the button but I think people wouldve rather had the toggle switch and an option to make holding in the lock button a shortcut like Samsung does
Boring extremely boring
Only Pro Max has USBC 30 every other model has USBC 20
"I have always said that I would switch to the iPhone the moment they feature USBC
So I guess its time to switchover now"
Only Apple can sell a basically the same phone just like the last 2 gen now finally with a USB port as a feature
It still looks the same
Next gen portrait mode Mane Samsung been had that my S21 had that lol At least everyone can charge an iPhone or Android with one charger
Very interesting about the focal lens shortcut test you did
Thats Apple give in the middle finger to the EU with you can have USBC  but you are not getting fast charging from it
They need to copy Samsung with charging headphones wirelessly via phone Like u put the AirPods on top the phone and they charge
The subtitle is from another video
Dont get excited with new Apple glossy phones Its just version number change every year OLD TECH IN NEW CASE old wine in new bottle
Its a waste of money if u dont need for work 
Its just a phone 
Garbage phone
bro always seems like a walking catalogue everything he reviews feels like a promo
Captions are not synced to the video
Bro that usb is shit how are u gonna transfer images and large videos 
All have new iPhone 14 now are sad
"Until they allow you to TURN OFF that lame smart HD filter they apply to every photo you take I wont be upgrading my phone My 14pro takes bizarrely overexposed photos compared to my X and theres no way to turn this incredibly horrible filter off

editIm an artist by profession and good photos of my work generate new business opportunities Upgrading to the iPhone 14pro has caused me enormous frustration and time wasted trying to undo that GOD FORSAKEN auto filtering"
the caption doesnt match to what you are saying
Subtitles are wrong from what he says
iPhone is turning into Android with that side button features  what happened with iPhone being iPhone
Its actually MKBHDs finding and analysis of iPhones over the years that have got Apple to make sensible changes
Still no fast charging Still no buy
Its just ironic that we evolved from button phones to smart touch screen phones just to use another button
They look tall and skinner like Galaxy phones
you should do a video on Huawei Mate 60 pro
"Did you know 3G is being fased out Its called 3G sunset Why would they refer it to sun rays So now everyone will be stuck with Lte and 5G
Meaning theres no way for you to go without a phone which the gouv cant intrude on you
I would advise everyome to stop buy portable phones go back to landline And get maybe an old phone or just an ipod If people want to communicate with you just do it with facetime or email Lets drop this crazy mania"
A16A17 Amazing bro
Overpriced Overhyped Overrated
Nice video from the guy mentioned in the keynote lol
Heck no no fast charging Nope Ill wait
Glad I didnt update all this while from my iPhone 11 Im sure this is the final refresh from the iPhone 12 design I can now start thinking of update Always get the best of the of every new internet iPhone design iteration guys
you is the weird is the
Bro the captions are sentient xD
All that just to play by european rules  A small step for Apple and a big step for the world 
The only reason Apple went to USBc is that the EU made it law that ALL electronic equipment MUST be able to be charged across the board which is USBc Did you miss all the news about Apples Legal Team trying to fight this new law over the last 2 years because they still wanted to keep Lightning If Apple had kept Lightning they could not sell the product throughout the whole of the EU
Ive got the 12pro So I will be definitely upgrading to the 15 pro
Its the same port all these other laptops and tablets have had for the past couple of years Man that shows how stuck youve been in Apple land Ive had USBC in all my devices for over five years Welcome to 2015 
I thought pro model can do 35W charging
Fast charging will come next year lol
They added usb c because the European Union wants a universal charger
I admire how he bich about Sony 219 ratio and now making a video in that ratio
I used to buy a new phone every year in the early ages of smartphones but Ive been rockin an iPhone 8 since 2018 and I still love it The hype is gone for me to run out and upgrade to a slightly better phone for 1000
Us cable thieves boutta show android niggas whats good
Just one thing I wanted to correct Titanium is NOT stronger than stainless steel The strength of any metal can be measured in many different ways Different applications require different kinds of strength Some are for fatigue some are for compression etc There are a handful of areas where titanium is slightly stronger but in most areas its a lot weaker material than stainless steel For example the tensile strength of titanium is about 05x while the impact strength is about 01x compared to stainless steel The remarkable property of titanium is not its strength but its strength to weight ratio
Thank you EU for banning other cabels than usb C
Im android for life Never owned an iphone before I like their mini ipad
Hi Marques Brownlee
The subtitles are from the  iPhone 15 Event Reactions Sneaky Updates video
save money
 
Base iPhones are still 60 hz Why 90 hz would have been a welcome improvement
I feel like on this new iPhone were just buying the type C port because l honestly think that theres no difference between the 14 pro max and the 15 pro max its like they removed the lightning and installed the type C and the other thing is l cant be sharing my cable with an Android user come on guys
captions are on steroids
Google Pixel 7 user just keeping up with the newest phone
How much money they paid you to say things like this
So is this thing better than the May60
I wonder if theres lots of staff lightning cables at work in cars and at home people may actually delay because of the plethora of lightning still about Like at my work everyone only has an iPhone except me
glazing over the raytracing and native AAA games 00
Turn the subtitle on and see the magic 
wrong subtitles 
Trust me nothing special Im not interested in the new iPhone
For now let me manage my Nokia 3310 while waiting for Iphone 20
Thank you  nothing about it makes me want to upgrade from my iPhone 12 Ill wait for the 16
Size is my most important filter Im holding onto my 512gb 13 mini until the Return of the Mini
Honestly all of these new iPhones simply cost to much when my trusty ole iPhone XR stops working is when Ill upgrade and unless they come up with some feature that I actually care about then I wont care to upgrade to a newer iPhone Id rather get an android than spend my money on something way too overpriced
Same shit different day
The SubtitlesClosed Captions is giving a very new content from the Video  MKBHD
hey i m from india iphone is way more expensive then USAhelp me out
Nah Gonna stick to my iPhone SE first gen 128gb 70 battery health
why do people keep buying iphones dissapointing
Its also 20
I really WANT to love the new iPhone because Im a ride or die Mac  Apple Music user But having switched to s23 when it came out after 10 yrs of iPhone I just cant justify spending the same 1k on an iPhone thats missing so many hardwaresoftware features I use on a daily basis I can accomplish everything I need on both the iPhone and Google  but because of the features GoogleSS have to offer I can do all of the things in less time Picking up an iPhone now is frustrating because it takes so much longer for me to do what I do Im not a power user by any means because I ONLY call text maps banking social media and music The samsung just does all of these basic things faster and thats what earns my business
so will the 14 pro get the new portrait mode features and any additional camera features the 15 is getting since they use the same camera system and have the same A16 chip
"Did anyone notice it or is it just me
The subtitles are completely different for the video "
What about fast charging
As always apple is taking a piss I love the video and picture quality my 13 mini takes but is it all worth it Couple weeks ago me and my friends were taking photos at night and decided to play with long exposure shots and light drawing iPhone photos were total garbage I tried every option possible At the same time Nothing Phone took such good photos it was incredible We did 30 sec exposures with it and the drawings were amazing that phone could basically replace a 1000 camera at that moment I hate the tech market right now
Nope Im over it I can pay my mortgage early and knock off months on the life of my mortgage Ill wit for 17 or even 30 yr anniversary of iPhone
"Not having the 5x lens on the standard size Pro is a joke surely they could have found a way to fit it for ALL pro models
Ill skip upgrading this year "
104 is Real
The CCs are from another video
MAY be worth it may be I got the 12 pro max still super clean its the gold one always thought of a gold brick when i have it in hand but this new titanium something about it
Love the new upgrades Especially the added next gen radiation reshuffling your DNA
Your subtitles arent synced
That dynamic island is worse than the notch

"810 Not really sure what could be meant with this There was nothing involving the interior that made replacing the back glass on the iphone difficult Nothing could be done internally to change this What made them difficult is how theyre bonded to the housing Unlike most androids where there are strips of adhesive apple went with some horrible bonding process that was near 100 as in not just surrounding edges All sorts of tooling was born of this like various laser machines all sorts of molds jigs etc No matter what though its such an unnecessary process and  honestly the outcome is better when just replacing the entire back housing Especially considering its safest to gut the phone there are spaces for magnets on the 13 series where a slip of the blade and youre straight into the battery But then going back to even the 11 propro max you have to use a punch around the lens assembly and risk damage to the cameras if not removed Ive also had plenty of work from b2b for board repair when techs get a little excited witht he punch

Trying to make it more repairable is not new though The 1414 plus are fastened in a way more like android devices Though the 14 propro max did not get this treatment I get a bit of a knee jerk reaction when people suggest apple is actually making an effort to make their devices more repairable On paper sure In reality not even a little bit False narrative"
Well it really was time for Apple to have C input 
they wouldve added fast charging to the new ports if they werent forced to replace the lighting port with USB C by the EU
Anyone else here missing the iPhone Mini Series 1213 Mini was and probably will be my most loved phone yet So sad apple discontinued them
Hi great review I have a question that noone has answered yet My 2 yr old car has the older USB 2 connections is it easy to grab a USB A male to Usb C cable for connected car Apple play Any car enthusiasts or Apple peeps know  Would really appreciate help thanks everyone Best wishes from Adelaide South Australia
Who cares about any of this at this point
I usually wait about a year after ive paid off my iphone to upgrade it cause ive always felt that im usually paying for a camera and memory storage Currently im on the 12 pro max blue phone paid Front screen with screen protector is cracked Back glass cracked Cameras back and front dont work so no face id lol  Battery cap is at 77 Imo i think i should upgrade
My 15k bought at 13k on offer phone with 65w working seamlessly for 2 years now I would rather buy a high end android and a dslr if needed
"I think the new iPhone looks promising But I wont be upgrading

What Im waiting for to upgrade my apple products
  UWB connectivity with AirPods to all devices for lossless audio and good quality whilst using the microphone and audio at the same time
  Happy with my M1 MBP and the only reason Id upgrade is for Apple Vision development if they eventually launch more of a consumer product
  As for Apple Watch Im not sure why Id upgrade I feel like it has been the same for like five years I guess I would upgrade if it came with like a weeks battery Right now I dont use sleep tracking because I need to charge my watch during the night and lets be honest no one wants to keep track of the battery and charge it through out the day just so you can enjoy sleep tracking and then charge it in the morning before you go to work so it lasts until the evening
  My iPhone is also tied to the Vision if it becomes mainstream and the iPhone has ecosystem advantages for the Vision"
If you have a 14 Pro its not worth upgrading
Is it a YouTube glitch at my end or captions dont match
STOP WASTING UR MONEY ON THESE
"Jangan beli anda akan menyesal    jika anda beli IQ Anda di pertanyakan
 "
I just need to know if the pro max will allow us to move big files without having to use third party apps or chopping up videos on the phone before transferring This stops me bothering with 4k but if we can now transfer any file size i will be making the switch
Apple has to go easy i cant even remember what iphone I have now
Care to resync the subtitles
MKBHD trying so hard to sell software updates While the only upgrade is a charging port which is forced by the EU Crazy how they sell this shit
The usbc slowold speed is a big bummer Its like getting a Ferrari with no tires
Still waiting for RCS to be implemented into iMessageone day maybe
Cool  Time to upgrade soon  My phone is 12 max pro
why subtitle is different with you saying
Really title for iphone 15 impressions is not just USBC But for samsung Z fold 5 and Z Flip 5 is They Settled
The main thing manufacturers should improve is their batteries A phone with a batterx that lasts a week would be incredible Otherwise there have been no groundbreaking apgrades on any phone in the last few years  except maybe the galaxy fold but lets be real wtf is that shit
For all the happy usbc commenters thank the European Union
Technically this is the third change in connector but youre right for the iPhone its the second change The first one was TECHNICALLY from FireWire to 30pin moving to lightning and now its USBC but thats only if youre counting the iPods If not then it stays as 2
Was really nice seeing a quality produced series and Adam back in his element
They really have to stop releasing every yearGreat that it has a usbc port now but realistically doesnt mean the lightning cable is just going away itll be awhile until apple completely gets it user base to be all usbc thats why it shouldve of been done years ago
The iPhone 12 is still my secondary phone for this year   Now waiting for 16 I also upgraded to a Pixel 7 from 3XL So 45 year cycle is ideal for me depending on whats on offer Now thats good for the environment and my wallet
I havent been excited about an iPhone since 2010 lol
Hey man soo now you have iphone 15 can u give me the 14
Xiaomi revealing the 180W fast charging at their event and goin ish cool yk  and apple revealing usbc as revolutionary says a whole lot
Blessings and Peace Yes I want the iPhone 15 Pro Max I received the iPhone 14 2 days ago and are sending it back for the 15 pro max Im currently with spectrum as a carrier Awesomeness m not tech savvy what should I ask for
why is everyone going on about usb c i want to know about the software in the phone
15 not innovative same as 11 12 13 14
Definitely justifies the 1500 dollar price tag Jk Apple is a terrible company just like all the rest Not that we didnt know that but fuck em
Titanium isnt stronger than stainless steel Google it
Talk about underwhelming To spend that long talking about a charging cable  port is hilarious Oooh let me spend a grand  it has a new charging port 
Funny how apple seems to bring features to their phones later than everyone else and then describe them as innovative technology and a leap in performance
Pre order my already 
"Honestly changing that iconic mute button is a pretty big disappointed for me That orange visual indicator was an awesome lowtech feature that made it much easier to tell if youre on mute and just dropping it seems like an afterthought because android phones already have customizable buttons so we need those too
Damn shame"
I love love love the PINK 
Which would be best 14 pro or 15
This is sad Ive had every iPhone since day 1 Ive never owned a android I just bought my very first non iPhone the galaxy fold 5 and Im blown away Ill probably never use a apple product again
Call me crazy but I think they have done a good job with the base model 15
You have to just apple is the best  same things very every year
Thanks Europe for the USBC
Anyone elses captions way off
ALL BOW TO YOUR EU OVERLORDS
Overpriced has been status icon that everyone and their mother owns with 0 actual innovations in its field 15
"Why dont you highlight these In 2023 these are very stupid things Apple does and get away with it because influencers dont talk about these much
1 60 hertz display on the base phones
2 USB 20 on base phones I know it is a A16 thing but still
3 USB 20 cable with the pro models you have to shell out more for the USB 30 cable
4 Slow charging
5 128GB base storage on the pro model really"
Lol
I havent changed my phone since iPhone X
Im using a Android worth 240 but still Im watching this because Im idk maybe its cool 
oh great another iPhone 14 is coming out 
Its legit an android now
AMAZING HOW EVERYTHING IS SIMILAR AND IDIOTS BUY EVERY YEAR A NEW ONE 
I dont think its enough to change my current phone Its as simple as that
Why is no one talking about product red
USB 20 in end 2023 is so embarrassing
Dam where can I get that wallpaper
Did the LIDAR sensor actually get upgraded Cant find any detail on the apple site or any forum or website Am I the only one who uses this feature on a regular basis
whats up with the subtitles
Yall crazy Ill stay with my iPhone 11 they all do the same shit just a few changes
Eu should have been specific that they also have to provide usb3 speeds
SAME PHONE AS 14 NOT DIFFERENCE
USBC is a requirement from the European Union in order to  standardise the chargers
If they are saying they are so for environment why didnt they just make the chip and replace it in the old iPhones and the other software changes via mobile update Its a question Dont take it too seriously
South Africans wont buy it They enjoy having they own cable
They look thinner
Bro just got the 14 pro max its fine looks the same D except the type c
Its usb c just because of a eu regulation and they dont want to make 2 versions
You can only feel the difference if for example you go from iphone 11 pro to iPhone 15 pro but is not smart to get the iphone 14 and then the iphone 15 I have iphone 14 pro so ill wait for the iPhone 17 because there is no need to upgrade
Battery Meh 
Why are your subtitles so off
Its shameful that people are so excited about a technology that existed few years ago such as the USBC port Apple are selling old technologies for premium prices I dont like iPhones anymore but I dont like android OS as well so Im stuck with iPhone
"Looking forward to Apple quoting MKBHD during next product launch with
This probably wont make a real difference to most people its kind of a bummer"
so there is nothing new 
they just improve stuffs that normal ppl dont mind I want a greater battery and a greater signalduh
And I will definitely be sticking with my IPhone 13 Pro Max still The iPhone 15 has almost no notable upgrades and I really am not trying to play games on my phone when I have a monster PC to use at home Well what a disappointing year for Apple hope the iPhone 16 will be revolutionary if not have to wait for the iPhone 17
i think the subtitles are for a different video
2000 nits screen Do people really need that
I am gonna buy a cage 4 u 
The action button is already found in old series  s9 and s 10 of samsung 
Its crazy how the EU really made them switch otherwise it would still be lightning and the only major difference would be the action button man 
Funny how I phone make it feel like theyve upgraded to USB C as if they invented it and didnt get sued and got banned because of lightning cable
Apple was still able to limit typec speeds
Theres an issue with the subtitles
with the USB 20 speeds in the current gen iPhones is just another thing they can update next year to say  now we have thunderbolt in all USBC and call it a massive update 
They dont give you fast charging for now it will be an innovative future on the iphone 16 pro max only
Minor upgrades same phone the past 6 years Pathetic 
Guess its time to replace my iphone X now
Thats same phone since iPhone X with camera and CPU upgrade
Why havent u previewed the new huawie  mate 60 pro This is all propaganda from now on  its deliberately to push iPhone against its competitors and u r an accomplice
Same crap different year
Everything ab these phones are sorta boring most people will only upgrade for usbchell i know i am
All I want is a pro mini I loved having a small phone but just cant go back to a 60hz screen
I have an iPhone 14 pro and I broke the frame It broke from falling on a couch and bouncing onto the ground it broke at the antennas though so its probably not going to be any different with the new frame material
How much did they pay you Youre not a true reviewer anymore and I hate to say it
whats wrong with the captions
"Theres basically no major changes from the previous model and nothing to beat Android competition 
Its stupid to buy this phone for just small changes Even the design is same as before"
Can someone explain to me about the storage i now see a 2 squared in the gbs and tbs
Im the only man dont ggot any iPhone still now
FYI the captions are messed up
I wonder how the iPhone would be if Steve Jobs was still here
Android charger just say it
It is the new design of the old design of the same design 
Is the snapdragon faster
wait no headphone jack lol
Type C is a welcome change But the wired EarPods gonna have type c Or they have a separate slot
how did you manage to talk about 3 changes for so long
Seriously USB2 This is year 2023 and you are giving us a 20 year old tech
Innovative thatthats it 
So like do you think the 15 Plus is worth it
Happy about that refurbished iPhone 11 that I bought last week
been an apple fanboy ever since jobs presented the 1st gen Now the whole thing is just appalling starting with a noncharismatic CEO who talks like hes holding a speech in front of a kindergarten down to a product that couldnt be more unexciting and irrelevant in 2023 Soon on Netflix the downfall of apple
Bruh iphone just copy e paste the dedicated shutter button for canera
     
Fix the subtitles Dude Theyre out of sync
Buying from Apple is buying trom CCP
whats going on with the captions
Another honest review 
I am currently using iPhone 11 pro MAX  which is broken  and fixing will cost me 120 USD as its covered under insurance and after spending 120 i can trade in for 300usd for a new phone but confused  if i should do that or not  what you guys recommend 
I was disappointed to see the MagSafe Duo and the MagSafe Battery pack were both discontinued after the announcement of USBC Hopefully they bring them back with USBC
Buy me one 
I think the USBC change is a good enough reason to get this over next years There has been rumors of price increase for a long time and it did not happen this year I am pretty confident that they raise the price next year so I will get this now and keep it for at least 3 years then upgrade
This is nothing but a joke with Retailers like us
Apple s TypeC notice
Great Review  i cant believe people are still paying so much to get the same phone
I have an iPhone 14 Pro Max Do I need to throw it into the Pacific and immediately rush to buy the 15
This is better than therapy and cheaper too
Android has done all this customisation 3 years ago
yeaah i would happy if we would get thunderbolt but it is what it is gonna switch from 14 pro to my first pro max this year
found the 1 apple shill
Just wondering will any USB C cable work with Apple Or does it require Apple certified USB C cable Lol
If apple give all the usb c benefits right away then theres one less thing to hype over on the next iphone
Apple has a long history of this kind of Fery Remember the once vaunted power PC CPU 
Dude your subtitlescc messed up
I am Sure that watching this video many peoples will buy iPhone 15 in 20232024
The subtitles 
Im deciding between the 14 pro max and the 15 plus which one should I get
we live in an age where we watch people talk about amazing change with tech that was already widely available for a few years now
Thanks EU
the price they have for the 1TB 15 pro max at their Swedish website is laughable 23 995 sek 214966 USD
He remembers flying hereon economy
"bong77w
USBC iPhone update "
Try giving one to Steve Jobs
Its surprising that Apple is happy to make small laggard linear changes and showcases them as a new phone It will be even sadder if this product becomes a hit
all of these including converting any photo to potraits have been in the pixel for 2 generations now whats cutting edge
Why they are doing it Easy answer No USBC no iphone market in Europe Apple actually does not give a shit about providing a customer with all the bells and whistles of USBC They got scared of new EU regulations towards consumer electronics without USBC
"Noticably lighter in the hand my G it is 1 fking gram lighter there is no way you can notice that I do not know how is it you and apple made so much out of literally NOTHING wtf is this distopia we are in

How on earth are people so stupid

The only good thing about this is now i know what to expect from someone with the latest iphone"
Is it still going to be difficult and very time consuming to replace the battery yourself  Years ago it wasnt too bad to replace it on your own if you were not technically challenged  But the Anker lineup looks good
Older backgrounds were much better marques
I have ADHD and your video was the only one I could watch straight through so kudos to you haha Ive always been the type that HAD to get the best iPhone aka iPhone S Plus and now Pro Max I also used to upgrade every year However as Ive gotten older I really dont care haha I have the 13 pro max and like it however I do want to upgrade since I skipped the 14 lineup although the purple color is dope af  I was torn between the 15 pro new gray color and 15 new blue color Ive always had the S PlusPro Max so Im kinda tired of the big screen lol The only defining factor as to my determination was the new button However after watching your video it isnt a big difference While its cool to customize your iPhone especially since you couldnt customize the older iPhones its not a big deal for me Plus with the button I feel like you could accidentally hit it in your pocket not knowing if your phone is on silent The good thing about the switch is that you literally KNOW if your phone is on silent Guess its the iPhone 15 in Blue for me Lol  SIDE NOTE I wish they came out with an iPhone with the same size as the original iPhone X 58 as I feel like that was the PERFECT size for me lol maybe in the future 
"Im sure you will correct this during the full review but you are mistaken about the cameras The iPhone 15 sensor albeit 48MP is smaller than the one on iPhone 14 pro So when they said that iPhone 15 pro had a larger sensor they meant larger than the 15 What they didnt say but is clearly visible in the numbers is that it is actually identical to the 14 pro Thats pretty sinister even for Apple considering they fooled even you   if only for a little bit
Its also pathetic that last years iPhone 14 pro is better than this years iPhone 15 in every aspect And it costs the same WOW Apples innovation is dead"
"Not just but only usb c
Marques you are realy good selling agent too bad you are a sellout"
hahahah get exited for a thing  usbC that we other have since 2016
i was going to upgrade from my iphone 12 pro but i just cant justify the cost for what little were getting from the iphone 15  this is if you own an iphone thats a few years old
Usb c as innovation Lol
Is the captions linked with the video wrong 
I am an Apple fan But Apple probably doesnt have anything new to upgrade to so they just launched something with small here and there but nothing major that excites people about buying the new one I have a phone 13 but there is no single particular reason for an upgrade to 15 cause there is nothing specifically new and there is just one identity of apple that is the lightning port and they removed it too also with the same slow USB C change nothing fast charge nothing new just the time passed for the 15 lineup very disappointing this time
Trash Same phone every year just better camera quality Just wait for the iPhone 20
Oh my god iPhone charge premium prices but still use usbc 20 which came out in 2000 23 years ago
I dont no what usb c does to make it so much better lmao no one cares about the design 99 percent of people use cases anyway Ill keep my 14 pro max
Thank you for this review and me and im sure many people will be sticking with our iphone 14 pros
its the same thing Not worth upgrading in my opinion Apple gotta step up and make things more exciting
How much of a jump is this from the 12 pro max
Eh not impressed
"What a joke its the same phone Just a higher price
And with new technology that has been in other brands for more than 4 years"
The king of late in the game 
I heard iPhone is so evil When they were required by the EU to only use Type C connection they could still make it proprietary to Apple iPhone can  now detect if you have plugged in it with an Apple accessory or not If its not the iOS can actually use the software to limit the transfer speed Only iPhone accessories can get full speed
Subtitles are gibberish why
ok my 12 will still be fighting for another year
Basically a new phone with really innovative features like USB type C cable and a portrait mode that was existing for years
So for the everyday average iPhone user nothing has changed Please bring out your own phones already Interchangeable batteries etc
MKBHD COUND YOU PLEASE UPDATE UR EMAIL AT YOUR ABOUT for BUSINESS DEALS PLS
its not just usb its type c which is EXPONENTIALY faster than other usbs its the best
What do you think is better iPhone 14pro or iPhones 15
for the full review you should see if pairing the iPhone 15 pro max with the Beats Studio pros via usbc cable if it allows for full lossless audio to be played
Someone please get me this phone 
whats happening with subtitles
yo whats up with the cc bruh
iPhone 15 is a dud
I dont think I will upgrade into iPhone 15 this year coz my iPhone 14 pro is still 100 battery health eversince I bought it this January 2023 Im soooo surprise to my 14pro because im also using it for gaming CODM while my iPhone 13 pro last year was reducing battery so quick like in just 2 months after I bought it it became 96 battery health 
Mapping the button to tesla shortcut to open the trunk
Is that the yellow one at 358  Does it actually look almost white like that in person
think the subtitles are messed up
Wow too bad theyre so hung up on not allowing people to use removable storage like a memory card  Always finding more ways to screw over their fanboy users  Wasnt a law issued in the European countries that all smart phones sold over there had to have a USB TypeC connector  And that is the only reason Apple changed from lightning to USB TypeC  Apple never does something out of the goodness of their heart
My 13 max still works perfectly After this Im going back to andriod
im an android user but i think its great that i dont have to carry a lightning cable around on trips to hand over to my friend for equipment
India is also making iPhone 15
"Same thing every year Whats happened to Apple

The biggest news is usbc

"
1000 for a recycled device 
Yeah the iPhone is still not for me but I do appreciate the switch to USBC and the multipurpose button instead of the ringer switch Customization has finally become a thing in Apple land
Preordering titanium blue Looks like its a good time to replace my full frame camera That USB C record to external SSD is such a great thing to have
Its all good but not enough to make me change from my 14 pro
If not EU we will still not get usb C in iPhone so its not a feature its a situation where they have been forced or they cant sell phones in Europe Lets say this loud and clear They are so behind with usb C 20 JOKE 
great review bro but honestly to me it is just USB C
A question about the ACTION BUTTON wont it be a security problem if they give the button the freedom to edit it I know that Android has been able to modify the function of individual buttons for many years but Apple
"Not interested in Iphone 15 any model Its time to leave Apple 

The company doesnt care about all users despite charging high prices for every model

But hey i liked your content and video you have a new subscriber"
Im of the mind that if you get the latest operating system from Apple you wont get much out of frequent hardware upgrades However  happens so now Im unexpectedly lining up to get a Pro Max FYI be careful if you use your iPhone underwater Put it in a dive case
This new Tech is pretty much cheap and trash 
sell out
Using the side button to open up safari
Didnt like the new features of the 14 dont care for any of the new features on the 15 Sticking with my 13 Pro
I have recovered from all this winning on the 15 USB 20 Imagine the possibilities 
the closed captions are so off on this video i thought i was dying
Still no fast charging  Still no sale
This was a great review
I am looking at my Google account said he is using my account to chat on these apps
RIP subtitles
"NO FAST CHARGE OVER USBC

What the absolute hell"
Kyle fatzinger has a gf me using my account
The new portrait feature existed in my Galaxy A51 
He got a gf
Usb c which samsung switched to in 2016 
Hmm same phone with new features
usb c
I wanted the burgundy color
Its 2023 and still no split screen and cant have volume adjustment in apps audio and ringtone volume in an IPhone Useless piece of shit 
Anker is China brand
iphone 15 pro is 95 the same as iphone 14 pro
No SD card over 1k price tag Nop and Nop
i find getting every other generation is best because each generation seems to be like 5 steps up so if you do every other its 1 step up Atleast thats the way I see it
Nothing worth upgrading Basically stupid camera update and slightly minor physical changes and charging port
Hey The guy in the camera holding a camera looks so cool I hope he will be fun in the club parties
whats up with the captions lmao
Its sad to see that usbc is considered a pro featureApple is dying
Interesting hat you didnt emotion spatial video with the pro lens is that because it wont be enabled for a few months Its been a couple of years since my last ugrade and I am interested in switching to the pro model
Quite frankly they shouldve gone to usb c years ago and its ridiculous they didnt until now
Whats the deal with the new iphones being able to record to an external hard drive Or is that just something made up I heard from another channel
Whoever wrote the CCs was really screwing around with stuff
3d camera   im actually more interested because of it  Hyper zooms  Titane  Gpu real powerup  Ai ready  Thread ready  Usbc  Nee button  to me its intetesting
It seems that Apple is doing USB C without whole heart
Dont care for the 15 Same thing with minimal upgrades from the last Keepin my 12 pro max till the 16 pro max comes Now thats gonna be a nice upgrade 
Shows him flying in first classwow we get it bro ur rich now get back to just showing the specs
So basically the iPhone 15 is nothing worthy to upgrade from iPhone 13 Pro
Im happy i bought Z Fold 5 last month and didnt wait for thid phone smh
No fingerprint sensor on the power button Why
"iPhone 15 disappointed me so much  
Apple was thinking hmmmm we dont have anything new  to do this year so lets change the frame to titanium and use usbc and lets call it 15 pro "
"I have an 11 Pro Max 64GB I am a videographer and NEED more space on my phone it is also starting to be real dodgy about my service and I have to restart it every so often to get it to work again
Needless to say I am due for an upgrade though I feel like the 16 is where Ill really want to upgrade as it will likely fix most of the pitfalls that Marquez was talking about This phone just doesnt seem that exciting 

Im most looking forward to ProRes and the new sensor though it doesnt feel super exciting because technologically these arent really big advancements Theyre just new to iPhone
I also dont really care for the action button I like the tactile switch and everything that the action button can do is super accessible already Youre shaving off like half a second I wish it at least looked cooler or was placed differently Off the top of my head right below the power button wouldnt be a bad spot but then the mute switch wouldve been a whole other decision 

All in all these are just my thoughts and Im not saying that these phones arent good I probably will end up getting one because Im due an upgrade and any lesser model doesnt make sense Thats how they get you isnt it Im not getting anything less than the pro max after having this one for years and Im not getting anything less than a 15 but Im also not getting everything I would want with the 15 those things are reserved for the 16 "
I got a 14 pro max  Guess Ill wait for iPhone 18 pro max
I still use an iPhone X that was the last time apple had any significant innovation in their phones Ill get this one then ill upgrade again when Apple finally releases a Foldable
I just get in shock in almost every time when people are surprised when new iphone feature is presentedthough its competitor presented to its costumers so many years before
Soooo I cant use apple wires Lame
After the iPhone 7 I bought the OnePlus 7 Pro and have been using that ever since Its still a great phone Im looking to jump back into the iPhone ecosystem so the 15 Pro Max is likely what Im leaning towards I do like the USBC addition I have so many of those cables laying around

You can tell he has almost no interest in this phone he has to try hard to have any enthusiasm 
To all my American friends here would you still buy the Pro and Pro Maxs base variant phone for 1623 and 1924 This is what it is in India lol D
Camp broke this year
iPhone 15 Pffffff this guy got 91M views in one day Thats impressive
Hot take usb c is shit thats why I left android they get loose and stop charging and get screwed up like they were literally designed to fail you have to treat them with way to much respect for the the port to even last the life of the phone
My brother is a photographer and told me images from a phone will never be that of a camera However the 48mp on the 14 was a game changer This 5X on the max is not so much Its still only a 12mp photo This for me was a huge let down You still get the 48mp lens So why not just buy a 14 Pro max at a discount Save yourself some money
Honestly not that empresses with the changed except for the type C charger
Apple is finally no longer that one weird kid after switching to USB C 
I FEEL SO BAD FOR IPHONE USERS  GLAD I GOT SAMSUNG 
When is the review coming up 
I see a recession coming
are the base phones 120hz
I have already bought the accessories as far as case screen protector and charger for the promax For whatever reason my s21 ultra has slowed down and doesnt work very well in my hometown although it does work great in Columbus Ohio The Periscope zoom as wet as always been missing on the iPhone and although 5x is not as much as I had hoped for its enough for me to switch from the Android and give Apple a chance after a few years away Really looking forward to playing with the phone and well be looking forward to more of your videos as you review the phone after sometime I hope Im not making a mistake by choosing this instead of waiting on the s24 ultra I place my order this Saturday with great anticipation great anticipation You have a friend in Columbus Ohio
Good to see your name quoting apple product
Since Apple is introducing the USBC charging port do you think they are going to bring out USB C accessories that allow fast charging and what other things do you think they will create Probably even a power bank just a thought
Think Im gonna wait another year and skip over the 15 See what 2024 brings us
the subtitle for this video is mismatched
Is that island really dynamic tho so you really have it obstructing the screen while gaming and its totally standing out like really
The action button on the iPhone 15 Pro is like the Bixby Button on my Note 9 where One UI let me assign the button Welcome to 2018 Apple Users
I will wait until next year to get the 16 I hope they keep the pink one but add it to the pro instead lol
I pretty much dont ever even plug my phone in I just wirelessly charge
"Engineers put usbc and its done
And apple fans fall for this sht"
my 11 still works
Very glad theyre choosing to use USB C as an android user its very hard asking for chargers in public
Camp dont care at all screw everything Apple
810
Among Us wasnt mentioned at all
FYI  steel is stronger than titanium
Im in camp thank you EU brothers and sisters for forcing apple to do the right thing
Apart from ditching the outdated lightning I failed to see any real innovation Now only see a bean counter squeezing the brand value
Hey MKBHD why is your video showing different captions its not sync with what your voice or what youre talking about
gr8 review u should stick to apple bcz your other devices review has bias
I hate Apple for milking us on Lightning cables for so many years Greedy pigs 
The fact that apple 15 youtube video has the comments disabled tells everything you need to know about the new version
Right now Honor is on the top to give exciting new features Apple can learn a thing or two from them
iPhone 17 with new fast charging
How does this video have 9 million views by the time I see this
Got almost everything from Android phone couple years ago
soin short I shouldnt buy a new phone and just keep my mini 13 Thanks marques
Cant wait to pre order the 15 pro max in natural titanium it looks amazing
Same thing
Honestly I have the 13 pro max and the only reason Im upgrading is cause my battery be drawing fast and faster phone
ppl are getting cancer from the iphone now wow it just came out    i want be getting a iwatch till they make it round
Only mkbhd can make a new shortcut button sound like ground breaking tech Apple needs to start putting in more work and screwing their customers
YOU CAN FAST CHARGE YOUR IPHONE 13 14 15 BUT REQUIRE SEPERATE 20W OR HIGHTER ADAPTOR
Now Ill buy an iPhone as I already have a 120W usb c flash charger but no fast charging is a bummer
Dnde est el Dolby Vision de este video Bsico
i have my preorder ready to go pro max in natural very excited for the new photo features and for a new phone in general im currently using an 11 
Lmao Iphones does not have fast charge For real
Still wild af that a 800900 has a 60hz refresh rate screen in 2023 lmao
Planning on getting pro max  Currently have 8plus
Apple fanboys kill me every year blinded mofos
Hilarious to try and act like usbc is a feature its old af
Samsung been using USBC for years About   apple change
"The feedback is really important but can you suggest for me should I get to 15 pro or 14 pro as price dropped
Anything major missing like type c or titanium"
How does the natural titanium look Is it the same color as the Apple Watch ultra
I hope Marcus doesnt sacrifice his ability to neutrally see things after Apple has quoted him Im having trust issues now
How many r like me who cant afford to buy this but watching this video 
"No wonder I am not an apple fun No matter what changes they do you dont get  exactly what your looking for 

USB 20 seriously It means is has no Display Port Which means you can not share the screen to big screen especially for ARVR devices "
Uhhh yyyeeaaahh umm the only problem IT STILL LOOK LIKE THE OTHER ONES Was hoping for at least a new look SMFH
Im sayin all we really needed were the iPhone 6X and 15 shoulda j skipped the other
tell you a joke2023 apple use USB 20
When are people going to stop being tricked into buying a new iPhone every year 
dynamic island is hideous
its still kinda surreal to look at an iPhone  C  USB Port on it bars
Of course its the best phone  question is do I really need to upgrade from my current iPhone
I hate that they make meaningless changes yet they charge an arm and a leg That being said Im still gonna but it 
0 changes as always Steve Jobs must be hurted on his grave He was always so passionate and driven by innovation and its been years since Iphone is always the same
I will definitely get it I still have my iphone 12 pro max so i need to upgrade
"Whoever made the shape like a silver bar is a true champ
I think thats another thing that triggers the mind"
Does the camera still impose that hideous automatic post processing on its images Not worth picking up if so
They do fast charge btw I have the 14 pro max it takes like half an hour to go from nil to 80 you just need a faster brick I went with Anker I have a bunch of them so I can charge wherever  its the brick that slows the charging not the phone  TRUE even faster charging would be nice but they do charge swiftly if you have a faster brick and the corresponding read not cheap cable I also bought corresponding Anker cables that support higher wattage
Apple become outdated and trash eversince steve job passed away
NO Just USBC
Cool another iPhone 4
Apple wasted 1 year
The blackberry had a customizable app button back in 2017
Might be my first iPhone
So once again Apple playing catch up to Samsung
"Did he say one piece
The one piece is real"
   
Video narration and subtitle is completely out of sync
For people like me I dont upgrade every year Usually go about 34 years This phone isnt a big upgrade to the 14 but compared to the 11 pro max its a pretty huge upgrade
I guess Im in camp totally getting one I still have my 11 pro max as my daily driver ever since it launched and I think its about time to upgrade
realme GT5 24Gb1Tb 240W charger 521
im still not ready to get rid of my google pixel
The subtitles dont match from Seoul 
Im in the camp of waiting for the 14 pro max to drop in price For the way I use the phone the 14 promax will be just fine and Ill save a buck
856 this just reminds me of the Bixby button on the Galaxy S10 You were able to customize it and have it to wear you can make it run other apps or even commands if you wanted to More recently I messed with it on my S10 and got it to where it now instantly turns on wireless charging which is awesome but otherwise yeah I would have it run Chrome but would generally not mess with it too much Cool that iPhone people finally get this feature but its definitely something that I dont think people should buy the pro just for even though you could think that it would be more useful Just saying that its a feature that isnt worth getting the pro alone even though I personally would love the 30 USB TypeC capability
The new default 1x is something I really want As a parent with a child I never use the 1x camera for photos The 1x camera has slowly widened from 28mm to 26mm to 24mm which is just too wide Id prefer 28mm or possibly 35mm
the closed caption is talking about completely different things lmao
Well done Score Europe1 Apple0  A warm welcome to Stateside iPhone users to the OCF party that is USBC I dont think even Apple is strong enough to fix this mess  You have a point though and also why not USB 31Thunderbolt on the Pro phones  Haha I have a customizable button on my Sammy phone First thing I did was disable it while I figured out what it could do xD  Spoiler alert all that stuff has already worked on nonApple stuff  I am still in camp a few years behind everyone
Samsung is going crazy over this video they almost showed all of their smartphone lineup through ads
Your color correction is off in this video
Looking for a playpause button in the future
its a flagship phone and using usb 2
its the effing same as the 14
EU  be a good person No racism here on earth
Your updates are good but try to avoid too much of explanation please  Feeling like so boring
All I see from Apple is GOOD MARKETING BUT ZERO INNOVATION IN THEIR PHONES
Honestly this update is so uninspired Especially after finding out about the Huawei mate 60 pro I am totally in the Apple ecosystem but the features on this iPhone doesnt excite me anymore
Now you cant finance the new iPhone if youre not using ATT Verizon or T Mobile 
you talked all USB C shit in video
pass u wasted your time perhaps shave or donate to help the homeless
it really is the 14 Pro S this yearI think the base model is the way to go unless you are really needing the camera features
These guys have way too much time on their hands
Gosh this guys narration is a snooze fest
Theyre saving the reverse charge for the iphone18
Is it just me or are the subtitles just completely wrong
dont care my 13 mini works fine thanks for the review tho
im waiting for the next gen iPhone SE
Android users are laughing at us so hard right now 
I have an iPhone 12 Pro will be pre ordering tomorrow morning
Two adds I cant skip
I am a samsung power user with a ZF4 and honestly Im tempted to try iphone with the switch to USBC the action button swype and all the other android things theyve added in the recent years
Hilarious that Apple is paywalling USB 30 in 2023
Apple more of the same  Or worst
Welp Ill be keeping my 13pm another year I guess
Different video subtitle updated
android still better
please stop calling digital systems ecosystems  its offensive to those of us who study ecosystems  which occur within the natural world  Techies are annoying
Im big mad we finally got a purple then they take it away f u apple
Saw the whole video and still not convinced about your video title
Apple is still chasing thinness like its a major feature smh
"Fantastic honest and open reviewunfortunately the pioneering spirit at Apple died with Steve Jobs 
Announcing an USBC port like it is an huge developmenthow funny is this
The problem are we were buying iPhones like crazy Im sure Apple would change their approach if we would show them how dissatisfied we are

Thanks for the great video"
Anker is the best
Fast charging for next generation iPhone 16 and will be headline as biggest feature update Overhyping features like this usb c with usb 3 speeds Meh
Whats crazy is the price and the incremental up grades
Thanks for the messagem greatly conveyed along with your pro and yet natural review man Your delivery has been on point and beyond Thanks
I would buy it
"Im at the crossroad here
Should i go for iPhone 15 or opt for 14 Pro
Not a pro photog tho"
Coming from an X I want one lol
Old design  just different material was used to make this new Apple 15 in short same old looking phone theyre using over the years and people are so hype about USBC that android had it ages ago lol nothing new noting revolutionary and Im not going to pay for a thousand bucks to something that offers few changes and yet people was so hype like crazy lol and Im still loving my Iphone Xs Max
I just want the new edge Looks great Cant stand this glossy slippery 14 pro stainless steel edge
So dumb they wont include a fast charger
WTF happened to the transcript and CC  Because yo they do not match the audio
truly the best even 5000 is worth it
The way the captions are completely out of sync with the actual audio in this video is crazy
Lightning is a better design Its more sturdy I never get a solid click the way the lightning cable locks into the port Usb c is a weak connection I dont care about anything else iPhone 13 Pro is all I need
subtitles misalignednotsyncing maybe it is me
I cant believe apple succumbed to the android world and mad the phones usbc to accommodate them instead of being different
no pro max
China and Billionaire tech oligarchs thank you for your support
looks bad they need to get rid of the notches most of apples hardware looks 510 years behind
Why theres no Product Red this year guys Any update
Wahoo another iphone with zero differences that actually matter Take muh money so i can be fake cool like the rest of us
The captions for this video is not correct
Same chip 
You look different today  More yellow lighting from one side maybe
Its crazy that every major change in Android is just a change but every minor change in the iPhone is a major change YouTubers are biased on iPhones I guess they pay well iPhones use USBC Periscope Camera new chip and a gimmick dynamic island  Le YouTubers  Innovation that changes the world Amazing Wow out of this world
Too all the apple fan boysgirlsno you can not borrow my charger Not him mentioning an apple user letting us use their chargerits the other way around buddy Whats the purpose of going usbc if its not fast charging anotha L for iphones
Im not sure but I think there is an issue with the subtitles might want to look into it Marques
In short nothing major has come hope apple doesnt slowdown the earlier phones
Minor improvements from 14 mainly usb c Ill wait for next year no sense in spending all that money on a similar build
Will iTunes come to other platforms if not Im stuck When the pro model becomes 300 then I can but it or if I make 120k per year then I can do pro
You own the IPhone yet you truly dont
Im just rolling my eyes
510
I love my X but pretty much forced to get a 15 since no more support for X
Are the captions messed up
They are saving the best for later to avoid see finish
I think Im going to keep my 14 Pro for another year then I want to give android another chance I wanna see what that Sony experience is like
Its great to see how the improvements on the iPhone 14 to the 15 Anyways i still believe at some point they would start making use of the other port type like Android For now my iPhone 7 plus is still good to go for some of my shootings and designs
Keeping my 14 pro for a while
no difference at all
"iPhone 100  no phone apple chip in human brain

One more thing when I am watching this video samsung galaxy ads was running"
60hz the innovation of Apple
Marques Brownlee  is it worth upgrading from iPhone 12 Pro max to 15 Pro Max  Thoughts Would love to have a video on it
I actually dislike the new design I love the glossy fingerprintmagnet stainless steel finish I like the fact that bezels got thinner though also USB C is great but not enough to make me switch Ill stick to the 14 Pro and wait til next year for the 16 Pro
Looking up the phone and seeing USBC and iPhone in the same sentence from Apple was genuinely a jumpscare
Its been awhile since I upgraded I still have the iPhone 12 Pro Max Didnt see a reason to upgrade since my specs were still relevant today But Im leaning towards getting a new phone soon that Ill keep for a couple years And Im tempted to upgrade since this is more future proof
The underurilisation of thr usbc ports is tactical Everyone associates them with android phones if they were a big uograde from thunderbolt this would make apple users question the myth that apples always best of the best By leaving these upgrades to the port till after the switch is established the yogrades become incredible apple uogrades apple doing it better rather than apple taking something better
Am I really the only one here sitting here thinking that this is the most lack luster trash upgrade ever like what is the point Samsung is innovating and Apple is doing nothing literally nothing MB ngl disappointed in your lack of transparency here its like you are avoiding insulting how boring this phone is like congratz I phone you added things that other phone have had for 3 years
I wish I could afford the new iPhone this year lol
I think the embedded subtitle is totally wrong so you can use autogenerated caption if you need that 
Best next feature will be enabling iphone to give CPU power to macbooks via usbc cable
Getting Samsung ads everytime while he posts videos about apple
Switching back to iphone after 2 years with my fold 3 which has been great so I am happy to see the USB C on thw new phones   Thanks for the video 
Apple looking the same as usual
I bet that camera magnification is for people who can see close up and use their camera as a magnifier to be able to read things
I didnt know the Pro Max was the only one that got ALL the goodies Looks like Im not upgrading this year
Basically its BS
This exactly why traded my 12 max pro in for a 14 pro max yesterday with a 1000 credit from ATT promotion because its still basically the same phone with a minor upgrade
Those colors I just want to take a bit out of the iPhone 15s
whats going on at the close captions lol
Whats next USB C Pro Apple might as well just close down their RD department and just wait for androids to push the boundaries before copying them Even their biggest headline USBC was a forced move by the government for standardization Imagine they are still on lightning The 15 truly has nothing new for even the apple fans to celebrate about
the picture of a moon must be still a light
I always appreciate MKBs perspective over many other reviewsopinions
Ima keep with my 14 no point of upgrading to the 15 literally almost the same thing  ima get the 16 pro max
Need this wallpaper
Can you please review the Huawei Mate 60 Pro next time Im very keen to know your thoughts on it Thanks
Same junk different year why Why Why
If you see the CC are wrong
Yes they successfully fooled us again while upgraded the outer case to titanium and they degraded the inner parts Total waste of money
They were forced to change to usb c My friend works at a phone repair place and he said 90 percent of there business is iPhone glass repair so there glass is junk
Ill keep my iPhone 12 until it dies then will see
Stoked to pick one of these up I wish I didnt just replace my airpod pros a couple months back otherwise I would be completely off lightning cable
Smartphones have reached the peak of innovation Its now really hard to create new features
Bring back the Mini
"anyone else just reading the captions and not even pay attention to the vid

"
"I am bad w Math is that 8 Million views 
In one day
Really enjoying this one MKBHD"
dont buy a apple it is rubbish and he he is talking for  14 minutes instead of saying it is rubbish
They were forced to switch to USBC by European Union law
In other words ZzZzZz
Ive had my iPhone 8 Plus since it came out All the iPhones since have been good but this one with all the newer tech better look and TypeC Ima upgrade to this and I feel Ill be happy with my iPhone 15 Pro Max
just put the early pre order in haha just gotta finalise in basket later currently got the Iphone XR so its worth an upgrade
Yeaah so basically not worth the upgrade Ill wait till iPhone 17 or something
So is Apple going to charge an extra 300 400 or 500 more for the Iphone 15 What new tech will it come with besides the USBC which is nothing new Apple products are only for the wealthy big corporations and pretenders
Whats up with the iPhone 15s main camera having a larger aperture f16 than the pro f178
Cant wait to see the jre durability test and teardown
Apple touts the iPhone as the phone that holds the highest value in the world and yet they offer you a meager 65000 tradein for an iPhone 14 Pro Max in excellent condition thats not even a year old yet
These few years is the worst model No changes Abit curve design n made ppl wow s21 ultra Im using basically the same what
I think Apple forgot that fingerprint was one of the main things we wanted That would have been a reasonable update
Im probably going to get one because my current phone is several years old battery isnt holding charge like it use to and it is time to upgrade
what is with the CC
Sounds like a skipyear then Im really hoping to see Apple sport a removable battery since the EU is pushing for that I can live with the lightning cable for now and I hope my 14 Pro Max will hold out until then Sidewish I dont care about waterproofing so if they go with a removable battery why not bring back the headphone jack They would be ahead of the game again since all other phones followed suit in removing it lol
The pricing is outrageous in India too expensive
My guess is the faster you charge a phone the less efficient it is which goes against their environmental goals
Same shit every year
I like charging port change and the baby pink color 
Do you think I should get the 15 pro max or the galaxy z flip 5
Does anyone think the iPhone Ultras will get Thunderbolt 5 ports
I wish there was a iphone 15 mini
STOPPPPP PRAISING THEM FOR THE BAREFUCKINGMINIMUM The YouTubers and the press needs to pressure them to innovate I use to be so excited to watch the fall event every year I stopped watching after the iPhone 13 event Its been the same phone Its sad it seems like they are afraid to make big moves
Innovation is at a standstill
Yeah it has small changes 
mehPhone 15
V
258 48MP chip 
Not sure if it is worth it for anybody who is up to date with last years iPhone but for me yes as I have IPhone X which almost 8 years old and I definitely need that upgrade
your subtitles are messed up
How about MKBHD running for CEO of Apple inc
I think its time to upgrade I got a iPhone 11
The only reason iphone went to usbC because they had to because of eu
That is great that Apple is having USB C now But I want them to innovative on USB C tech to be better and faster charging Apple and others innovative on their chips but dont innovative on the selfie camera and having more battery that lasts longer Can they finally make a screen that doesnt get cracked when dropped on the floor
They avoid fast charging due to lithium degradation The iphones battery last a lot longer  The Androids that do this are burning through the battery Also titanium is stronger but its not harder and isnt as impact resistant
Subtitles had a heart attack 
titanium is not stronger than steel
Mudou foi nada
Twice as bright My eyes in the morning are styrofoam already
There needs to be another AirPods Max thats waterproof for everyday use cuts thats the only reason why I dont want it
Ever since Tim Cook took charge of Apple Apple has had no innovation on their products just price increases The upgrades are just cosmetics Not true functionality change Steve Jobs would be disappointed
Mediocre update
If it wasnt for Imessage and airdrop I would have an android rn and mostly its the imessage and ft
They still havent removed the front camera from the screen Jesus Christ these guys are so far behind
"Coming from an XR user I think id notice even the shape of the phone
Also couldnt you also just use back two like ik its not solid but then youd still have more options"
Me watching this knowing my broke ass wont get it
The base iPhone still having a 60hz screen is a major fail Theyre pushing the pro models at the expense of making the base iPhone look outdated compared to the competition
APPLE is ducking boring these days
Im still using the 6
congrats to apple for catching up to android
"Ive been watching your videos for a long time now This is the first one Ive seen you genuinely struggle to tell us that theres anything different about the phones and you looked disappointed 

I really believe the 15 pro and pro max are gonna flop and people are gonna go with 14 pros or just get the base which is now a 14 pro without the 120 refresh rate"
I like Brisket and mashed potatoes
Maybe Apple will sell USB3 adapter to suit ip 15 models  again upselling
USB c is because of EU regulation
"Fact

ACTION BUTTON was copied from SAMSUNG that they already eradicated from their phones

APPLE  NO INNOVATION AT ALL"
Mute Button giving me Blackberry vibes 
Can I set the action button to unlock my phone
Ip15 have dynamic island 
They still gonna charge 7532 dollars for a USBc cable with the apple brand on it
Nobody uses APPLE in Chillingbourne
"You did a great job in this video review Marques  

I like the new iPhone 15 and I think the USB port is a big deal I had an iPhone question then SE then a Motorola stylus 5G now and Id like to get the iPhone 15 Pro next  Its really nice Tim Cook quoted you about the MacBook Air in the start of this presentation too"
Yo I just checked my camera on the iPhone 14 just 14 and it goes up to 5x wtf
Sorry Marques its just USBC I dont need the features on the promax Its just USBC Im still slightly bitter they havent brought the touch ID scanner back like on the iPad and the two way wireless charging Kinda insane they didnt do that
"remember when apple made phones that you could distinguish what model they are
but now every iphone is the exact same they are just more expensive and also have with 1 new color available"
Your Subtitles are not in sync
I have the 14pro I see no reason to upgrade USBC 1 more Gpu core And slightly better video Not worth 
The white colour iphone 15 pro 
This is bullshit Im buying a Android
Did someone already mention that the caption for the video is supposed to be for the other video titled iPhone 15 Event Reactions
You didnt mention the best part of the keynote  more iCloud storage
2023
Technology is limited by nature Imagine if lithium dissappear
The biggest change is something all androids have had for the past decade nice 
Let me get my BlackBerry 8700 out of the drawer to check that magic button
Marques just know you and very VERY few other people are the only ones able to actually present an iPhone You give it the real way and then you give us your opinion 
iPhone 2000
The imported Subtitles are not in sync 
Writing this as a iPhone 14 pro user there are no significant improvements with this years lineup They really gave up on trying to do anything revolutionary this year I really wanted to upgrade but these changes are not worth even a 100 upgrade fee
when the uograde is a charger plug portfugazi
so no upgrades really
One piece is real 103
I hear investors werent that impressed by the 15s new features 
Pissed about the usbc I wont be buying any of the new phones The lightning charger was superior never had issues until the  c port with my iPad air4 They made a huge mistake 
"Sounds like not a good investment for me
Ill wait for the next year or maybe switch to Samsung"
look its an iphone x wiht an xtra camera its still apiece of garbage
Apple changed to USB Charger because the EU forced Apple to do so in Europe for all its iPhones Nothing else
I have my iPhone XS Max since 2020which I bought used for 500usd I told my mom stop buying cheap androids for 300 dollars and just buy an iPhone 3 years later shes had 3 of those shitty androids and my iPhone is intact and I could even resell it for probably 200300 rn in Colombia not even a bad investment if you think about it
"What is up with the captions
255
Maybe its me but its talking about chainsaws"
Thanks  Very informative
I know youre a apple fan boy BUT how can you make such a positive review of a product thats basically iPhone 14 with an USB 20 and has just 14 more power that its previous generation
My YouTube premium subscription skipped 4 annoying reminders Damn
Now the customizable button is a new feature My iPad 2 from 10 years ago had a button that I can set up to be either mute or rotation lock 
Does anyone know if theres a titanium MacBook in the works
Why is it impossible for them to make Pro phones in the soft cute color options like they do with the basic models What a Pro cant have a kawaii pastel pink lavender phone Boring
how much did Apple pay you to make this vid
For this premium price you get a USB 2 device in almost 2024 Haha haha I love my pixel phone even more now 
I play codm and I was wondering if the IPhone is better than my iPhone 13 pro max
I purchased the 14 Pro Max at the beginning of the summer I was a virgin  only using Samsung Now I have the S20 that need repairs from water damage Im so done with upgrading 
iphone does not have my vote anymore they fell the fuck off after Jobs died Android is our only other option in this monopoly
Apple are still greedy company you cant change that
THE SUBTITLES LMAO
Im tired of Apple not doing anything innovative Im ready to leave
Unfortunately the main camera sensor of the 15 Pro is most likely the IMX803 which is also in the 14 Pro The specs are the same Apple should have used the newer IMX903 sensor
  a samsung s 23 ultra fan
Im switching iphone 14 pro max to Samsung15 is not worth it Minimal garbage upgrade
people who impulsively upgrade their phone every year make no sense to me
Same phone different port smh this is getting old Apple has failed to bring us anything new for YEARS
ANDROID RULES
15 Pro is a banger
the air maxes 
I dropped my 14 like maybe 3 or 4 times already Head high because I placed it on the window niche whenever Im showering and when the wind blows the curtain it flungs and dives to the floor many times facing directly towards the floor sometimes on the sides but my still no problems at all
Why does he think he should be paid for a quote being used from him Its called a quote he even got credit at least they didnt plagiarize
those who just finished paying off for 13th got some new motivation 
Wow the ad
Is it only me or the subtitles arent syncing
And we still cant see what we are taking a picture of in bright sunlit environments or anything else for that matter
it kills me that apple hasnt gotten rid of the glass backs I am a apple fan boy and supporter since I could ever remember but comon apple if you can get rid of lighting port  the 30 pin connector and headphone jack  you too can remove it  This is why I probably will not ever get an iPhone ill just stick with pixel or Samsung and yes Ive dropped a Samsung with a glass back 5 feet and it didnt shatter at all I  accidentally dropped my beloved iPhone 12 Pro on accident less then 10 feet both times and it still completely broke  Yes most people will say it was my fault to begin with and I could honestly respect that but its the fact that apple doesnt care a single bit like why cant the backs of the newer iPhones use same glass as the front ones  Before I had switched to the pixel 6 my current phone I always had dropped my phone a lot it didnt shatter but when it came to dropping it on the back glass with a very durable case like an otter box it shatters I just dont get it
Marques you put wrong subtitles
Not worth 1100
Can I just say that none of this is worth the money
Why is Apple so far behind geez
Yay apple was finally pushed down by eu regulations and was forced to use type c Cant wait for second round of sanctions where it would be forced to remove artificial usb20 slow down for non apple cables And also third round of sanction where it would be forced to make battery removable
you kids are addicted to the wrong idols if you only knew the principalities behind all this
Im sure my wife cant wait to get one of these and steal all of my charger cables 
Incorrect eng subtitle Please fix it
WHAT A JOKE Marques you did excellent Apple smh
Im currently a Samsung fan But i would love to try out this phone I cant afford it and I already have the Samsung A54 5G
Fast changing degrades the battery quickly thats why they dont do it
I dont understand why they cant add a feature without also taking one away Why cant we have a silent switch and an action button
"Looks like the captions are messed up  theyre the ones from Sneaky Updates

Also opinion USBC sucks Apple is Apple They shouldnt be told how to build a phone by the EU Its not going to create less ewaste its going to create more As everyone upgrades every single lightning accessory in the world  and there are a lot of them  become ewaste Apple should stay on Lightning The EU Committee doesnt know how to build a smartphone"
Does anyone have a decent use for the dynamic island Ive had the 14 pro for almost a year and Ive only noticed that it gets in the way
My thoughts are Really Thats it
It must have been hard to sound enthusiastic about the new features that have been out for almost 10 years already
"Sneakily 
Tshirt"
"Can somebody help me please IPhone 15 or IPhone 14 Pro what should I pick and why 
Thank you"
Ive never bought an Apple phone and I never will because theres nothing better than an Android phone thats actually controlled by its user and thats not possible with an Apple phone the difference between Apple and Android is Apples a dictator An a control freek phone and Android is whatever you want it to be an I would recommend anybody thats going to buy a phone buy a used phone or by last years version dont pay the prices if we stopped buying their phones cuz theyre too highpriced the answer is do yourself a favor and buy a used phone
Many people manufactures made basketball players until Deloris Jordan made one Celia Mara Cuccittini did the same for Futbol and Sophie Kumpen for F1 moral you dont have to be first to be the best  Why must people keep saying Apple didnt do X first It is a character trait at this point wait for the others to prove the concept and kinda eff it up and then come back and blow it out the water
first time i saw an apple event and the memes were right they really do love to use that word innovative way too much I dont think they know what that word means
Bro are you from NY I couldve sworn i saw you by 34th Street Either that or youve got a doppelganger
Business class Someday before I die 
why the captions are not matching or correct 
Hope they go back to 35 headphones jack too
So who is going to buy me one 
Apple is learning for once
Where are the Steve Job kinda big leaps  these are not new tech  Chinese phones have had great cameras  usb C has been around for years   I wont be upgrading soon Maybe 17 or 18
And the pros are lighter
I have been waiting for your iPhone 15 review since the day apple launched it
Slowly catching up with samsung
Is it me or are the closed captions from a completely different video
Why even release a new phone theres nothing new enough to warrant it wait for the technology to develop so if feel like its worth buying its literally the same phone with usb c and a different mute button everything else is completely un noticeable to majority of their customers
So basically what is new is Apple got sued into switching to USBC
"Brother I fully understand your angle as a content creator but as an influencer who knows the tech industry well I was expecting you to call out Apple and their ridiculous iPhone 15 launch  Dont you feel like youre caught in a neverending cycle of revolutionary updates Every keynote starts with  Prepare to be amazed again by the latest barely different iPhone 15

Here is what Tim should have said at yesterdays keynote Let me know your thoughts Marques

Welcome to the future Introducing the iPhone 15 a groundbreaking transformation from the iPhone 14 which itself was a revolutionary redesign of the iPhone 13 which wasbelieve it or nota reimagined iPhone 12 Are you sensing a pattern here
Visually sure you might think youre looking at the iPhone 14s twin but dont be fooled The iPhone 15 is an entirely different beast weighing in at a staggering one gram lighter and costing just a smidge morebecause of innovation
But wait it gets better Prepare for the most earthshattering advancement in iPhone history the addition of a USBC port Thats right you can now discard those extortionately priced Lightning cables And lets be clear this monumental decision was entirely ours and absolutely not mandated by any pesky regulations We swear
Craving creativity Rejoice because the iPhone 15 is available in an overwhelming assortment of colors sizes and price points that essentially do the same thing Our aim is to baffle you into impulsively choosing the priciest model
Oh and lets not forget those two extra cameras we threw in for good measure They dont really add any functional value but they do let you zoom an additional 3 feet with a telephoto lens you never knew you needed
But the pice de rsistance Our cuttingedge processor accomplishes well nothing different from its predecessor Its there and thats what matters
By the way have you noticed those incessant notifications Your iCloud storage is full Again So why not upgrade today
To cap off this technological marvel weve decided to give the iPhone 15 the battery life of the iPhone 13 Yes we could have fixed the iPhone 14s battery life or better yet not messed with it at all But wheres the fun in that
Ladies and gentlemen we present the iPhone 15redefining the word revolutionary for the umpteenth time Welcome to the future you never knew you didnt need"
I need this but im broke
Is it my tv or is the dynamic range on the left side of his face to dark idk but it looks weird the shadow is really dark on that side
Hmm Ive got a blue 12 mini and am actually finally kinda interested Also really tired of the blue But Ive also been wanting to ditch iPhone for an android for a few years too Hmm
Does the screen still auto dim in sunlight Even when the option is turned off
I dont like usb c tho
I m not going to update my iPhone  this year nor next 8 Reason to that is that apple is not making any major changes Same shape and phone does everything same as iPhone 13
Wow apple invented USB30 in 2023 its amazing
So you cant even reverse wireless charge the air pods with the new iPhone
"Usbc and a customize Button 

Android User whould be exited in 2013"
cough overpriced cough
It makes me kind of disappointed that they showed an iphone 15 that has mainly the same camera hardware and Chip as iphone 14 pro but they seem to not be releasing that 24MP photo feature for the 14 pro Thats kind of messed up I was hoping for a bigger support from Apple on old phones
Umm what is up with the caption words lol they are not what he is saying
Just another pathetic iPhone improvement I was never a Steve Jobs fan but Tim is or opening a void for a new premium competitor or riding Apple to the ground
Steve Jobs would have rejected the ugly and bulky camera on the back
i have the 10s and might finally upgrade  ill probably just get the 15
Yet again no reason to upgrade
Worst product
This is probably the most iterative update Ive ever seen on a phone
Charge Speed
So technically you could go phone to phone with another phone and charge a dead phone using yours 
Im in neither camp Couldnt care less about Apple products except for the iPad I just like to watch you present technology 
mkbhd The captions for this video seem to be for the other iPhone event video
Some people dont care about their phones they care about the person who lives in it
I think you guys uploaded the wrong caption file  This has the caption of the sneaky update video
"iphone 7 plus My first and only phone got it in 9th grade Its time for an upgrade 


lol"
Same phone  as before and nothing much just like the FIFA football game they just add something every year
low key disappointed with this years lineup i wanted more fast charging wouldve been huge along with all phones having 256gb all phones getting the new chip i was seriously thinking about getting this one but i might wait this year
Apple is saving fast charging for iPhone 16 
captions do not match with audio kindly rectify it
I think the subtitles are not timed correctly please check
You shoot me down but I wont falliPhone Titanium
Im waiting for some comparison videos between 12 promax and 15 Pro Max To see if its worth the upgrade Probably not 
My iphone 14 pro max is still the best Im going for 16 or 17
"Innovation of the 2023 now no fast charging LOLOLOLOLOL These Apple engineers are something else
ANDROID way ahead"
Im still waiting for your review when we will have phones in our eyes
Did the bezels become smaller on the iPhone 15 or just the pro models
Its c3apa cash grab by apple
cant tell if this video was boring or there wasnt much for Marques to really talk about  Apple is really trying to get away with stupid  nonexistent upgrades
My guy on Southwest staying humble
Your subtitles is way off bro
215 lol imagine having a friend who doesnt have an iPhone
watch apple system lock out any non apple usbc cablecharger
The captions are not for this video its for a Macbook review
"Camp dont care at all here

Waiting for the Galaxy S25 Ultra"
Hey Marques umm the captions seem like theyre from some other video
Throwing a Kunai faster then guy isnt a big task The kunai is way more aerodynamic and lightweight guy could probably throw it across the planet lol
Its nice to see these phones
P E A C E
"I hate the well such and such phone has been doing this for years nonsense

Theres like a dozen Android phone makers who each make a dozen different phones every year Of course they will experiment and try every technology imaginable

Perhaps the true shine of Apple is knowing what not to put into their devices Only the top quality stuff please"
This really seems like the most marginal update yet
Just fyi the subtitles on this are totally wrong
Anyone know where to snag that wallpaper
whats up with the captions
Iphoners always have excuses to justify buying iphone 
Dude Fast charging kills batteries faster and what is it people like to whinge about after they have had a phone for a couple of years the battery life
So all standard features for Androids from 5 years ago Great stuff
Its actually just type c
This was required why is anyone shocked
Is the back of the 15 pro glass or titanium
Fast Chargings gonna be the main selling point for the 16 next year
This product was brought to you by IPHONE
great vid Im very much on board with the usbc port for the iPhone About dam time
Just me or are the subtitles broken for this video
yall need to chill tf out with these crop cuts we get it you record in like gazillion k resolution but sheeeeesh
I think Ill finally be making the switch from my Pixel iOS seems to be at a point where they have the best features of Android bundled with an ecosystem that is consistently supported
"Why do I see iPhone 15 Event Reactions Sneaky Updates
subtitles on
 iPhone 1515 Pro Impressions Not Just USBC"
Hey bro you forgot to say that they kept the 60hz screen on the 1515plus sadly to have a 60hz expensive phone like that in 2023
"1112 RE setting a default zoom argh So close Ever since my iPhone 5 Ive wanted to be able to set the camera app to default to 2x I just found that something like 90 of the time I end up either switching to about 2x or wishing I had time to switch to 2x zoom 

And its almost inevitably the times when Im trying to take the photo as quickly as possible to capture something that I most want that particular zoom level With the 11 Pro and I think XS 2X wqs one of the buttons so that was nicebut its still one more thing I have to do and without accidentally invoking the zoom dial while Im trying to capture a fleeting shot With 3x being the button on my 13 Pro I now find myself either dialing up to 2x or hitting the 3x button and dialing down to 2x with almost every shot So having a 2x button on screen again wouldbe nice but why cant I set the default zoom to 2x Or 6x Or 05x Or whatever"
"At this point content creators such as MKBHD literally have to squeez the innovation and upgrades outta Apple launches 

Apple be giving them nothing to actually convey to their respective audiences Wonder what MRWHOISTHEBOSS would say on these new launches "
iPhone 16 XXL Turbo Max is better 
"Apple lost its magic just like MS lost its magic with Surface Pro 
Despite the upgrade to USB C still only with USB 20 with regular version USB 30 protocol with Pro lines This is a joke They brag about the feature all the other android phones have been using for the last 10 years 
Steve Jobs must be crying in heaven for the lack of innovations at Apple Inc"
kindly fix subtitles plz thanks
Great video please could do a comparison between 13 pro 14 pro and 15  Thank you
1025 Apple already specified in their launch video that its because of bigger room in the phonewe are putting 5x Maybe you need to watch video again
as a avid android user Im getting this because of how cute the pink one is
My broke ass cannot afford an iphone
The future of Apple with their chargers is that they will eventually eliminate it
New iphone features fall under something already seen in phones in the past is such an apple thing to do Including the exclusively
"Re Corner radius  Is it just me or is this the thing that changes every few iPhones just so that something has changed since the last batch of iPhones  I mean

iPhone 3G and 3GS  Rounded back
iPhone 4 4S 5 5S  Squared edges
iPhone 6 6S 7 8  Rounded edges
iPhone 10 11 12 13 14  Squared edges
iPhone 15  Lightly rounded edges

So I guess the question is around iPhone 1719 will we go back to fully rounded edges or squared edges again  P

Its kind of like the back of the phone  Glass  Metal  Glass  Metal  Glass  Ooooh I wonder whats coming next"
are we shocked that usb c 30 is only on the expensive model though
Ive been in camp iphone since the first one  The iphone14 is the first one Im not really happy with  Its been buggy  I feel like the picture quality is actually worse than the 13 etc etc etc  Now the 15s biggest upgrade is USB C  lol  What a joke  If I didnt like the Iphones video quality and the ecosystem in general Id be switching
Apple CPU are junk
640 no new fast charging despite Type C  Wait until they introduce it for 16 series as the Next Gen  Revolutionary feature God 
Thanks for keeping it real
Apple phones are for people that dont know how to use a computer
is the subtitles messed up did they copy paste subtitles from another video
It was a failure
Im waiting for Jerryrighteverything  video
USB C  breaking problems incoming
214 your friends android phone  No thanks mate Its the other way around  Man i hope you read this
Id like to preface this by saying I am a die hard iPhone fan not necessarily Apple in its entirety but the iPhone specifically Ive ran an iPhone since 2013 However USB 20 on a new higher end  smartphone in 2023 is frankly embarrassing If not thunderbolt really in a modern smartphone nothing lower than 30 is really acceptable
Im starting to realize why I was an android guy for the last decade
The way Tim mentioned your name was priceless moment 
New apple doesnt feel new the smartphone industry doesnt feel exciting as it was before Same stuff again every year Thats a pity
Well time to keep my 12 pro max for another year
For those of us who dont live in the city I think you buried the lead I live in Steamboat Springs Colorado Spend a lot of time not in cell service The ability to contact roadside assistance anywhere is HUGE So for those of us living in Colorado Utah Wyoming Montana etc that might be the biggest reason to upgrade
Ill get it  in about 5 years  thanks to the EU for forcing Apple to do something consumer friendly replaceable batteries  expandable memory coming up
"At this point none of the smart phones impress me

Oh look a new camera new powerful chip ooo titanium new colors  boring 

I really feel the whole IOS needs to be torn down and built from scratch with a whole new way of working on the phone You make the camera really impressive or make the phone so powerful yet what exactly is all that for If the software really cant utilize it than its a waste 

All these smart phones have amazing specs from Apple to Androids  but Im not really seeing anything innovative or expansive about the OS 

Just had a thought How about not only could a smart phone act as a hotspot but what about a remote server for someone developing code on an iPad The phone could have an Apache Server connected in with an iPad Pro Allow package managers Great concept for developers like myself who maybe dont want to lug around a laptop and would need internet access to test backend codesqlphp etc

You could load packages or modules in with cell service  but if you wanted to work offline you could I mean they could add full local host support too"
"I didnt know it was coming About time We ditched apple years ago because of that and other things But that was a major one My boss even switched to android That was a huge change for him
If only their computers would go back to non soldered ram and hard drives Then Id consider going back Oh and right to repair and have parts available for purchase by anyone 
If only framework would make a cell phone Eco system for life"
Try changing with a NONE apple usbc charger it will not charge at normal speed and the phone or ipad will say not charging
"Camp  Dont Care At All 
Great review though Its always good to see many 5 year old Android  features to get innovated"
like because it was an nice video  but the iphone 15 is really the same think 
No headphone jack
"lol usb c thats been in android I think for more than 5 years and now that to with superfast charging 
but guess what  will also introduce fast charging but next year  and sheeps are going to boast abt it"
104
nah im not impressed with this new iphone
Wish they kept the purple pro
Hi your subtitles are wrong
Samsung user here Planning to switch to an iphone cause a majority of everyone around me has iphone and it will be more convenient for texting and calling idk if iphone 15 is also completely esim Not a fan of that I might just keep my samsung phone for international travels just for the sim card slot
I was confused They have more advanced 3nm CPU chip but there is no any improvement on power consumption or signal strength Did I miss the point
14 pro Deep Purple  
Im watching on my Iphone 11
I know it wouldnt happen in 1 million years but Apple should take returns on their old cords 10 old courts gets one free cord
Not much news here
Still not convinced Apple making good phones Im staying with Sony
Exactly why iPhone keep doing this to yall ppl like this guymaking videos pretending the phone aint the same shit
I thought you would be most excited about being able to record directly to an external hard drive That should make it easier to use your iPhone to record video for your Chanel
your closed captions dont line up in this video
I hope similar options come about for a future iphone SE
Not sure if others are having this issue but the close captioning is all wrong Somethings off
Im sure this new phone will help me to do all of the new the I  I got nothin
"This is the asusual Apples dirty business they offer you an advanced OS and a 5yearsold hardware I cannot even imagine how one will cheer up only because of adding USBC to a phone while all other phones in the world had it several years ago and what is so funny is the discrimination between the poor iPhone standard with ancient USB 20 and the rich iPhone Pro with USB 30 standard not USB 30 2x2 not thunderbolt why to keep stealing your money year after year and the funnier thing is lack of fast charging  I have a 65W charger in my 2yearsold Chinese phone what is the miracle here to add such charger oh I forgot they waived out charger as well as headphones while keeping their high ridiculous prices but they have fanboys that admire anything they offer and that is what keeps this company going I predict iPhone 16 with USB 30 2x2 and iPhone 20 with Thunderbolt or USB 40 when the whole industry will be adopting USB 70
This sucks"
Same craprepackaged
20
I was actually thinking of getting a pixel this time
I would love if they just went back to metal backing like on the 5
I think If apple is gonna change things on their phones why not put the changes on ALL their models
Stop fooling ppl by offering old wine in New bottle
Its finally time to retire my iPhone 8 Plus Looking forward to the huge leap in innovation
Im still rolling with a iPhone 13 Pro Max and its perfectly fine for another year or so
What is that background picture you used for the thumbnail on the iphone so beautiful is there anywhere I can download it  thank you
USB C  titanium frame  and a Bixby button
Where can I get that wallpaper in the thumbnail
The fact that this is a 13min video talking about maybe 3 changes between the 15 and 14 reminds me why I havent subscribed here
This black guy ooh loves Apple 
Is no reason too upgrade nothing change Usb C hehehehhe bin
Looks like theres no reason for many of us to upgrade
Nice but Im happy with my currrent iPhone 13 Pro Probably will wait for the iPhone 17 Pro or iPhone 18 Pro
I feel this may be the first time I dont get the iPhone upgrade and I doubt Im alone I feel its a different time now for many and expect lack luster sales Think Ill wait for it to drop 100
yes because ure paid for it
iNnOvAtIoN
Nothing revolutionary from Apple  Samsung and Google are still better smart phones
I have the note 20 ultra and I keep telling my wife that Ill get an iPhone when the new one comes out so we can FaceTime That was 2 years ago and I dont think itll change this year either Maybe next year 
I mean anyone gonna ask the question why is the transfer rate on the usbc 480mbs
There is NOTHING different apart from the charging port iPhones suck
Faster usb c features will be for the 16 because theres not much in way of updates for the 16
Despite no any changes on iPhone 15s and watches you made 13 minute video which is great work
Im hoping they make a iPhone Fold Like an IPad Mini 6 that folds
10 faster for the PRO 3nm chip means the M3 will only get a slight bump in performance so no point waiting
Great video Hows the autostabilization for action videos Running training etc
Very disappointing launch
They release the same thing basically every year
i want the new airpods to use wideband NOW frfr
958 but can it open bixby 
Wrong captions
Im Reeeeaaaallly sick of crapple being so stingy with the memory and charging a fortune for extra memory  Im ditching crapple
"i am still here sitting around and watching and using my ipad six like its nothing and imma just keep watching and watching




















i want this so bad"
Ugh Dont say you like Titanium color the best  I was hoping that by picking it Id avoid high demand phone and get it launch day 
Apple is basically releasing the standard model iPhone Nth and the S model iPhone Nth Pro at the same time and the 1515 pro proves theyre out of ideas
how can you afford a business class who sponsored it
Im expecting the title of your review to be iPhone 1515 Pro Review Nothing weve not seen Before 
Bro loves noticeably lighter phones now Shaming lighter phones for not having premium feel did not age well
Thanks Marques Brownlee very informative video you covered a lot of things that were not mentioned by Apple
I stopped buying new iPhones every release since the 11pro Still call and text the same people need something a bit more innovative than a USBc
Tbh I just think that apple is running out of innovating ideas for the iPhone series Dope review great that you mention about the USB 3 transfer speed But I think they just need to take a break with putting out the same iPhone every year And this is coming from an iPhone 12MacBook User
Subtitles are incorrect at the start
 Disgusting  apple 15 pro max  Disgusting colour 
Will stick to my 13 Pro Max till they do something worth upgrading for Only reason I am even getting the series 9 watch is because someone lots my series 4 one even with that I dont see much difference
captions arent synced properly
Im still happy with my Iphone 11 will be upgrading in another 2 years Thats when this phone will stop receiving updates
So now if press the button in your pocket it will come off mute not great
I am getting the 15 pro Coming from the 12 pro so its a huge upgrade for me
Next  previous track for music controls would be great for action button
Your closed caption file for this video is the file from your other video
No form change  no thanks
"Nothing weve not seen before 
At this point Tim Cook should just announce that Apple wont be releasing new phones next year"
So it is 2023 an people are excited about usb c on a phone 
i would be embarassed to call this next model if i was apple ceo Literally same shit
Seems like paid video by Apple I used to love MKBHD but its all biased review Nothing else 
The One Cable to rule them all
Still hate the notch or island whatever At least give us a software option to push the top of the screen image down and have a forehead  id much rather that Also disappointed still no TouchID just put it in the Apple logo on the back Disappointed the mini is gone I love my 12 mini I do like USBC for compatibility though the physical design of Lightning connector is superior I do like the color the brushed titanium and frosted glass looks real nice Would like to see more color though Overall more of the same and I see no reason to upgrade In case you couldnt tell Id like a 15 mini with no islandnotch and the screen below the sensors at the top with a touchID reader on the Apple logo on the back and id rather stick with Lightning connector  though I dont use it much anyway as I mostly use the wireless charging Yes it is slow I dont care I dont use my phone a ton and id rather save the battery Im almost 25 years into my 12 mini and am at 94 battery
Just what i needed to hear I can wait another year Thank you for the effort and information MKBHD
Apple charging premiums and giving nothing for it What a sham
Can you charge a iPhone with second iPhones power now
finally  been waiting on this
iphone 15 or iphone 14 pro
I skipped last year due to non removable sim card and this one if it remains the same I will probably have to move to Canada to buy one with sim card
"Imagine being a grown ass adult and buying apple products on purpose

Fxcking yikes"
You are a iPhone lover or apple licker so you didnt find any lacking
"regarding the multipliers on the photos they mentioned the 24 28 and 35mm equivalence  What I am curious is whether they just crop the image to correspond to these focal lengths or these is more adjustment being done by computational photography to correct for perspective  Focal lengths are not just the width of the shot but also depth perception  Not sure if that can be tweaked digitally
Also reading the rumors I was under the impression that the periscope lens on the Pro Max will allow for variable zoom  but in reality they put a 120mm equivalent  Which is cool but not as cool as having 80120mm equivalent optical zoom that I thought the technology would bring"
You should be able to do more than one thing with the Action Button How about double or triple tab with other functions
Ill be preordering the 15 Pro Max tomorrow but thats mainly because Im on an 11 Pro Max now and its time to upgrade Futureproofing and using for multiple cycles is the way to go now that we no longer get revolutionary jumps annually in this tech space
i dont get this iphone its like a numb phone
Apple settled Samsung went for more
Imagine if Apple just added UsbC from the start instead of spending millions of dollars on a lawsuit they lost to EU forcing usbc on apple
Hi bro
Surprised you didnt mention how your prediction didnt turn out true when you said you thought they were actually not going to implement USBC and instead force people to use the energywasting wireless charging instead Im so glad they chose the right path of just implementing USBC
Just wait until Teslas charge with a USBC and then all of your devices are USBC
NEXT IPHONE 16 Removable battery
Looking forward to Iphone 15  but still want a 13 mini form factor Why couldnt they make a 15 mini Still rocking my 11 pro
Anyone else having subtitle sync issues Seem to be a few minutes ahead of the video
My god what a boring phone USB 20 on the regular models I would even consider this phone a downgrade
EU regulations forced USBC end of the story D
Can you map the special actions button to Bixby   Muahahaha
"If you cant afford one like me atleast comment
"
Im excited about USBC Totally gonna look forward to uploading my videos through that new cable Ive managed to keep immaculate Apple Devices When you resell them you get the best return I upgrade every year and manage to pay a difference of about 200 to 300 Apple products really sell well especially when in good condition
why are the subtitles completely different to what youre saying something fishy about that you probably copied someone elses video
"Comment section is always open LoL 
Apple "
Honestly I am over the iPhone hype Little modifications  nothing HUGE  and I think it is important to note that Apple would have continued using their own charging cable had it not been the EU that forced them to do the change they are still expensive and honestly with how the economy is and the world seems to be on fire  HOW DOES THIS HELP To put it plainly  it doesnt
"Professionally Im in camp Let me be aware of the new potential

Personally Im in camp Let me see how much longer until they discontinue products for my current phone Lol"
Oh looksame phone
i miss getting excited about iphone releases
I think that Apple stopped offering good features and big changes a long time ago because of their users I was an iPhone user but I stopped using it when I saw what was behind the walls of Apple Garden Currently I am following Apple news Hopefully if Apple users will push the company to offer something better than what it offers now even if only for one year
Wow I wish my samsung 23 ultra would do that lol take notes samsung
This new phone series is as boring as it possibly could be
lmao iphone keeping up the circus performance for all these years 
Hm the guy he was capturing with the camera was pretty cute tbh 1108
60 hz  Big NO
bro your subtitles are crazy
Are they not upgrading to USB C just because they lost the lawsuit mandating them to install USB C ports in Europe
Sooo can you still charge the Iphone 15 wireless  or no
Im coming from a 12 pro max so I think its time to upgrade now
In the end of the day for Iphone 14 pro users I feel like this trade would be for the new lateral button and the camera improvements that for a regular user wouldnt make that big of a difference What I truly wanted was fast charging and better battery for pro models I feel like it runs out in the second I start to play some game
I actually love the focal length defaults As a photographer myself 35mm is my favorite focal length for general work but sometimes 28mm is great for street photography Ill probably never use 24mm unless Im traveling
"Just noticed that the cc doesnt match what your speaking about 
Looks like the CC are talking about the new Apple Watch Thought you might find this helpful "
Looks like a iPhone
Although people always complain that each years changes are not very drastic they often overlook the performance improvements You dont have to upgrade every year but if you upgrade once every few years its a noticeable difference
Next year Apple will add fast charging and 2 more curves to the iPhone and boom you have iPhone16 What a useless company
Wallpaper from the thumb
Even iJustines video was better Your videos are very boring Learn a thing or two from iJustine or Arun Good luck 
Would it be too much to ask to put a pure sapphire display on a phone
Its the same nothing changes God there are no big changes the same thing over and over and over again Its already tired and boring to be honest
Tbh I think I will keep my 14 pro max I dont really care for usb c
waoow welcome to 2012 when Samsung Note 3 had 30 usb 
Is it just me or are the subtitles completely different Was a fun cognitive challenge
This is just a minor update to 14 But still 14 owner will buy 15
I held out for as long as I could but Im going to upgrade from my Iphone 8finally
the 15 pro in blue titanium looks awesome
Lets go ahead make me want to buy something I dont have the budget for 
Ive had an iPhone for about 12 years I love iPhones but now Im seriously considering switching to Samsung Mostly to try something new but also because it seems apple is trying to do as little as possible to increase profit margins At least with Samsung theyre trying new things the folding phones and truly trying to make the best device for their customers like having fast charging and an inscreen fingerprint reader
Its the same bloody phone I want my iphone to flip like that Samsung one lol or have fun colors and designs I like my iPhone 14 pro but Im bored
iPhone generations are getting so insignificantly incremental that how the A17 is the first chip from Apple to say pro on it is worth mentioning
Do people still get exited over the new iPhone release Lol its like the same phone every year iPhone has less generational improvement than the GPU market its so sad
Great video Im curious about the zoom capabilities  On my 13 I have 05 1 and 3 which I think in terms of a dslr  is 13mm 26mm and 78mm  So what is the 2x on the new phone  is that 2 x 26mm and is it possible to zoom between the 2x and the 5x and retain a good image 48mm to 120mm is quite a jump if you dont need to go that far Thanks
Apple is just coke selling the Same product in different bottles cans
I aint buying a super thanks Foh
Still 20 watt charging I guess they are saving that for next year lame
353 The worst part about all of this is honestly Apple is a genius because now theyre able to sell you What should have been last years phone as this years phone And then they sell you a new phone So technically theyre profiting off A twoyearold phone for 2 years which is great Honestly its the best thing ever when dealing with sheep because theyre stupid  Why remember when the 14 and 14 plus are the theres no difference between that and the 13 Theres no difference I was laughing so hard I said Okay well my eyes will just get a 13 pro And its cheaper and its the same
Same phone and such a shame its paid previews by MKHBD
146 This is how you know youre a sheep you youre getting freaked out or getting hyped app or something thats been out for oh how many years is it not like 10 12 years on everything else phones laptops tablet just think about it thats like if you want to go tell everybody heverybody Hey my parents finally hugged me  How old are you Im 52 and the only reason they hugged me is because I had to pull them out of a burning building and I couldnt drag them Thats how sad that sounds and then the opening of this is look through this in a lens I dont know I like when other reviews are just very Blunt about it And they say yeah apple is just pulling your leg and its sApple is pulling your leg and its s
Id really like a super mini iPhone or a foldable Am I the only one that hates huge phones
That event looks like one of the most tragic things people taking pictures of phoneswith phones
Marques talking about USBC for two minutes in the year 2023 is funny and a thing only apple could achieve
its pointless to upgrade if u currently have a 14 Pro Max
brother this is the first time Ive seen you you look like 2 pac
Will the adapter be same or different
glass is glass and glass can brake
Every update is dumber and dumber Freaking usb C Really Btw kudos to the EU regulation for forcing apple to this game changing inovation
ok king
Im still out here with my iphone 7
14 pro max user here definitely not worth the upgrade but im still getting it lol
Should I upgrade from the 14 Pro to the 15 Pro or 15 Pro Max Currently I have the iPhone 14 Pro Space Black 256GB which has scrolling stuttering battery life is bad it has lags in the Camera app and some games and overheating issues Battery and Camera are the most important things for me and I used a 12PM before which was too big and heavy to use but now there is the lighter Titanium material and the curved edges make it feel more comfortable to use So therefore should I still chose the 15 Pro Max over the 15 Pro this year Also is 256Gb enough And which color would you choose
"In classic photography think for example Leica lenses 24 28 and 35mm are the most common focal distances A photographer would have their favourite out of those 3 options
So its kind of nice to choose the one which youre most used to"
Ya idk what youre doing with your iPhone when it charges but mine was at 4 and went to 89 in 40 minutes think thats good
Unless I get a great deal on trade in Ill be sticking with my 13 pro Usb C is a great change but theres just not enough of a change to make me upgrade My iPad is overdue for an upgrade though Its super sluggish now so Id be down for a newer model once they put usb C on the lower models
So basically its a shit upgrade and not worth the money nor the Fake upgrade Youre doing your best to sell it so not exactly a unbiased review Will watch your full review
This cap they just put out the real iPhone event and it is going to have usbc 
I have an 11 pro max and I am starting to feel the urge to upgrade I might try to wait until next year though 
Apple like introducing the new revolutionary USB type C
Coming from an 11pro IM SOLD Yes sir Count me in Where do I sign  About time and I love it My only gripe is as a photography enthusiast I wont have the 5x zoom on the pro And cuz I cycle and run the max is just too big
Can u use any type c cable or r we goin to see the dreaded accessory not compatible also do we get a new wired usb type c earphones
Congratulations rich people
Stronger phone doesnt matter until it dents your floor when you drop it
"Camp dont care at all and dont uerstand people in a frenzy about 911 increase in x category and different bezelso better run out and get it so I can do it again in 14 months when the next amazing 8 faster and new bezel model comes out 
typed from my used refurb Note 10 that does what a phone should do 
Boy what a snooze fest imagine how carbon neutral this launch party was for Apple What a garbage society"
"No impression to same sht

Its the same thing  MKBHD
I wish they made titainium sides with a black back
Wow sounds like an android
Im using a 13 Mini and Im just wondering how awesome would it be to have 16 mini with all the features of the 15 pro Titanium USB C Cameras and all that good stuff So I guess ill just wait for my 13 mini to kick the bucket or until they revive the mini line again
so my dude using this iphone since 2 months ago before its production 
What a waste of money Modern technology is rubbish
84m views in a day
I guess Ima have to wait for iPhone 16 currently on 13 and I feel like I just got it yesterday 
Im probably the ONLY person in the world whos worried that USBC will be weaker in terms of physical reliability If that little tab inside your iPhone breakscracks now your phone cant be charged AT ALL At least with lighting the port was FIRM and also the tab was on the cable sideso if the tab breaks you just replace the cablenot repair the phone 
What are these subtitles
Apple is late to the usb c game holy
"and the speed of that usb c port is from the last centurycongratulations appel
refresh rate60 hztitanium frameuseless anyway the phone is kept in the case and is not visible
too few keep it without the covercongratulations appel"
The captions are so good haha
Apple robbing yall blind 
Me with a galaxy a12 
"Did you hear theres an 11 faster increase in this thing 
People spend so much time gawking and making a fuss and buying the latest thing for the clout "
Still rocking with my iPhone 8 Plus lol
Doesnt AirPods Max still have lightening
mkbhd I think you have added the subtitles of MacBook air review  047
All that money and they still cant make more than four colours
Save your money people go get an iPhone 12 Its LITERALLY A iPhone 12 with minor upgrades which is not worth 1000
So their biggest innovation was forced upon them by the EU 
Every year Apple proves to me I was completely right about moving to Andriod 4 years ago 
Huge disappointment forcing you to get the bigger size to enjoy the best 5x camera I have always loved that I can look at the silent button and be sure that my phone is on silent they present USB C like they did a favor to anyone and not that they were forced to do it I am amazed how such a shitty company still has so many fans and doesnt get the hate they deserve More and more new iphone generations come with few or none noteworthy features For me the only one this generation is the 3D video but for sure I wont pay a fortune for the Apple glasses to have it
The honesty is louder than the iPhone speakers can handle OOF
But if my daughter drops it face down will the screen crack  Again  Or did they make the actual phone part any better so maybe I could hear people on the other end  If not why even call it a phone anymore
Yeah Im going to get the 15pro looking forward 
no fast charging  apple could explain their switch to usbc its the EU Apple wouldnt have done this superb change if they werent legally forced to
Apple gets USB 2 in 2023 
Im going to be upgrading from an XS to the 15 Pro Max Im so glad Ive moved away from cycle upgrades
Only apple would screw up USB c 2023 and still no fast charging Same company that said youre holding their phone wrong
Just stumbled across your channel and I have subscribed Im a person with a disability and I need the features of the iPhone provides Im currently using an SE 2020 but Ive been thinking about upgrading to a no home button model Going to get my hands on these and see what they feel like I need to do that because I am a totally blind person Thanks for your information Im not surprised they went the USBC route as Europe has declared it as a main feature of all other mobile devices Apple pretty much had to do that from what I understand
Apple is stealing our money  people had usb c for more than 5 years and you hear the idiots clapping and surprised in  the apple event because of USB C  
Thank you for this video on iPhone
idk when the last time you plugged your phone in was bruv do you think were all super rich techy guys like you i aint got no phone with wireless charging and id imagine the majority of people watching this dont either
My biggest annoyance with having an iPhone is always having a cable issue when with friends with android Being able to share cables with everyone finally makes things so much better
THe switch to USBC is nice but the side button is honestly my favorite that seems super conveinient
The charging speeds influence the battery life so Im fine with 20w if thats the sweet spot
Definitely on camp dont care at all
Bro at 952 I see Duy Tham from Vietnam
Umm your captions are from a MacBook Air video  Definitely need to FIX
My favourite Tech YouTuber
Most People Is Right  theres Nothing New About The New IPhone 15 Or 15 Pro  So Dont Waste Your Money If you Have The IPhone 14 Pro Or 14 Pro Max Keep It  the iPhone 15  Has The Same Features Of The IPhone 14 Pro So In My Opinion Its Not Worth it
was going to get an iphone 15 so I can start switching fully to USBC but after seeing theres no fast charging and my accessories are still using lightning probably waiting for more refreshes next yr
"Well this is the update I need big change for the base and pro models
But have to wait until the price is make sense in my country"
It blows my mind to see people flocking to the same phone but with upgraded chips and cameras every year
1302 im not sure i still have the 12 pro and was thinking about getting the 14 pro but didnt have money i said id wait for the 15 pro but now i might wanna wait for the 16 pro
When can we pre order I know its friday but what time on Friday
Im still rocking an 8 I like tech but I hate spending money on it Do I buy a discounted 14 or go with the 15
How are you supposed to charge it without a brick
This iPhone idea has ran stale moving on
Honestly the only thing that breaks are the lens
the richest most resourceful tech company not having basic innovative features is going to bite their asses sooner or later they better get that money and talent to good use for iPhone 16s redesign apple phones are more boring than ever these days still great products but there are far better options now in compare to older days
stupid to wait apple  come on  who believs that this trash is soemthing very new
wonder if they named it A17 pro just to use something weaker A17 non pro in next gen iphone 1616 plus
Dafuq happened to the cc
"Making me pay for a charger on 14 then making it obsolete for 15 is a slap on the face
Not upgrading anymore"
English caption not actually match any of the video 
"Dont trust you Marquees

You just twist facts to show that anytime Apple does it great"
I have an iPhone 14 Plus which meets my needs perfectly 
Im currently using the 14 Pro and have been using it since it launched last september Im really 5050 on this upgrade since Im mostly intrested in the camera specs of course the USBC would be a nice feature when it comes to transfer those ProRaw and ProRes files Ill also have to see what FiLMiC Pro will have to offer with the Promodels but again I could be tempted to skip this and wait for the iPhone 16s in 2024
"Wow her Marquees does it paid 

Paid Apple reviewer

He didnt get a shout out from Tim look for no reason

Never buy any Apple product by being influenced by this guy"
if apple fan says they added a thing thats been around for COUPLE of years its mean probably 10 years
Saw you with your red camera cool stuff bro
IPhone is good but I buy mate 60 pro
Apple is so boring im switching to the Fold 5
Samsung has that button Has had that button Mine opens spitify
Insane how youtubers have become part of apples marketing They rarely say anything hurtful towards the company
the captions and subtitles on this video are wrong  did anyone notice that 
So no ones gonna question the refresh rate in iphone 15 Come on why is it so tough for them to make it Atleast 90hz  I thought you would have a say in that marques APPLE should stick to the s upgrade because its literally teeny tiny upgrades
This could just have been a software update lol
How much are they paying you to say this
thanks for your valuable comments have the 12 and thinking if I should get the 14 pro and save some extra  or the 15 pro
S23U is still way better
Really wish people would stop saying faster when its only more powerful These computational benchmark scores dont actually translate into anything happening faster anymore when theyre already so far in to overkill territory for years now But cue the inevitable people pretending they edit and render 8k HDR videos on their 6  15k phone screen while simultaneously playing Genshin Impact to pretend they need any of this  Marques himself aside of course The one person on all of earth that actually might
141 what is wrong with captions
Same Phone with a usbc port  wow apple
"Pretty content with my 13 pro
I can easily wait another year lets see what iPhone 16 offer us"
I am waiting fir wifi7 for my upgrade 40Gbps
Apple added a type C charging port OMG what an upgrade
end of lighting port and mute switch no more good phones left then gotta find an nokia 3310 then
This might not seem like big upgrades to yall but Im going from an 11 pro to 15 pro max so I am kinda blown away ngl
Would be nice to double tap the action buttons or triple to add different actions
You have me dying with how you talk with your body 
The irony of Apple banning leather products because muh footprint but probably contributing to the largest source of Ewaste via Macbooks that brick themselves is truly hilarious
I went from the 8 plus to the 12 pro and it was a big change for me Now I wont get another one until the next one is way different
for me the best thing u didnt mention is that this phone is capable to run RESIDENT EVIL 4 REMAKE How just how a phone has the power of a ps4ps5 console
Im going to keep my 14 pro max
I personally will not waste my money for a status symbol  the phone is still the same as the 12 just faster and better camera woo
The biggest feature is the USBC portwhich they were essentially FORCED to change because of the EU kudos to the EU for calling out Apples BS and forcing their hand  Apple could have done this YEARS ago but stalled as long as they could due to their greed Decent phones but Im indifferent I use a lot of Apple products but Im not nearly as impressed with them as I used to be
How much did Apple Pay you
Ill Just Keep My 12Pro Max lol
Iphone again with THE BIGGEST IDIOT TAX on the planet How is possible people to buy apple  and then remember the people in NY who dont know how many MOONS eath have or the CIVIL war is aginst who And remember the Apple  OMG
Really thinking about giving up my 13 mini for the Pro Max I do love my mini but I notice the refresh rate difference between current devices and my battery health is not doing well I originally went from a pro max to the mini guess it is time to return
Everyones talking about the phone I just love that plane windowout transition  How
Def bc planning on getting it
Time to upgrade my 12 Pro Max but thinking to go with the 15 plus Everything else seems superfluous to my day to day needs Were already rocking minicomputers that outperform the Apollo11 computers no need to carry a mainframe dedicated to do social media post unless thats your thing of course
"Big difference on their separation in the models this year Its basically Pro or nothing The regular missing all of those additions makes it worse then basically any and every other flagship but the Pro sounds pretty good actually except the price for what you get Thats just classic Apple tax tho
I dont however get the dynamic islands usefulness at all I tried it on a Pixel for a few days yeah of course they have an app for that and its worse than the old way or the Android way of gettinginteracting with notifications Uninstalled in 2 days File that under the standard does nothing actually better in any way but theyll cheer lead it as Jesus 2 way that its always been"
Please give a iPhone 15 pro I am big fan of you Please give me
Whats up with this subscribe begging recently
im afraid that Apple from now on will limit the new features for the Pro like Dynamic island and now the action feature Wait a year and drop it on the baseline iPhone and now hold the new Chips for the Pro only and the Pro from their prior iPhone pro for the baseline Iphone
Still waiting for the Apple Pro Max Stand for my upgrade
I miss the good old days when new phones were innovative These days it takes 5 years for anything noticeably different They got us all under their spell
"I still like the old silent button 
Its easier to on and off in my pocket"
"Iphone 15 charging speed is not specified  they have introduced 70W Apple charger
Pls resolve this confusionThanks"
Lol same shit as iphone 14 and 13 pro
Short and simple no reason to think about the 15 if someone has 14 Pro
nah they screwed up by removing the mute switch
Nah at this point Apple is scamming yall with the same product and milking it even more with accessories lol
I wont be impressed until it folds lmao
Dont buy it
Will there be anymore colors coming soon for the pro max The smaller phones seem to get all the fun colors 
1108 That poor guys posing for the photo giving his best looks only to have none taken 
Im switching this year hopefully getting it on time  Mainly for the cameras on the Pro Max to try out Im upgrading from the 12 Pro so Im interested to see how noticeable the camera is going to be 
These phones havent been worth the upgrade since the x lets be real
Imagine being happy being 5 years behind
sht phonecrapple
Next gen portrait mode been on pixels a while
EU forced them to use a usb c and soon a replaceable battery lol
this guy create content for apple products  but he knows and accept that android serves so much better than iPhone funny thing
So just usbc Thx
Apple charges you a whooping 150 for a 5 feet long usb3 cable I think thats worth mentioning
Yay Iphone Welcome to 2019
all iphone are the same
Is there an iPhone SE 2023 coming 
Hi Marques do you have any thoughts when shopping the 15 vs 15 Pro You mentioned some of the performance differences but how does that apply in the real world
Wth rubbish upgrades new camera with one lense with digital zoom and people buy this craplmao usb with 20 watt charging omg what a rip offS23 ULTRA STILL THE KING
i normal switch phones every 46 year and i got the iphone 13 pro atm so mainly so i was curious if there was more to it then just the USBC port this year and Marques did so well as always with this review thank you
82 million views shows just how sad society is that they believe the latest IPhone or the latest technology for that matter is going to bring them happiness bloody sheep the lot of them Wake up people a phone is there to serve a purpose and should only be replaced when yours breaks Saddos
camp waiting for MKBHDs review to decide which side Im on
What an excellent review
I saw a rumor that youd only be able to utilize USB 30 speeds using an apple manufactured cable Im still worried that may be true
Camp DGAF Yayyy you went to USBC Remember when each to update to either hardware or software was always exciting because they pushed the capabilities so far ahead Thats been gone for many years and now we are celebrating the incorporation of an RFC standard WTF
ANYTHING is more worth than my piece of junk iphone 14 pro the camera sucks even everyone else said the iphone 13 pro has better camera than this cant wait to preorder the iphone 15 plus in pink 
Can I transfer all files on windows explorer using the type c without using itunes or any wireless transfer
Not sure if there are enough new features to upgrade from my 13 Pro Max 1TB especially considering the price hike for the larger storage models
The flagship and seemingly only change to iPhone this year a new charger port So cool the best feature is that you have to get all new accessories because your old ones are obsolete for basically no reason What a great company that totally is not full of huge shit sandwiches I remember when Apple was a revolutionary company
wohoo lets change the body throw an old charging port thats been out already for a couple of years in most devices and lets call it pro once more and heyyyy lets charge the same price you know what nahh lets make it a little bit more pricey because of the changes and sell it people will go crazy at it like always What a shame that after so many years you dont see any major improving in model or technology after so so many years
Red camara production
Handsome potatoe at 11 seconds lol
I want to go back to Samsung
Viewer question asked at the end of the video I think iPhone is not interesting
"So basically iphones new phone is still trying to be android
Customizable physical button and what else "
Morons I am not upgrading
They defaulted the 1 12x and 15x because you can shot pro raw on those 3 focal lengths and not any others If you remember last year on the Pro iPhones you could only do it on the 1x
Regarding the fast charging if they dont put it now it will be an opportunity for the next generation Its more a comercial thing I suppose
mkbhd what color will you be choosing
Apple is just so dull year on year and people flock to it Mad
Shot on red camera 
So its the same phone again but with usbc who wouldve known
Titanium is actually less strong than steel is It has a better strength to weight ratio than steel but unless they made the new frame thicker it being made of titanium means it is less durable than the previous one
good review
Does the button activate Google assistant
How do yall get the phones to unbox
The action button is something old people need on every single phone  Its weird to me that there still isnt an iPhone Silver thats watered down iOS  Huge market these days and Im tired of having to explain complicated actions and apps to my elderly parentsfamily
Portraits already taken also can be refocused Ive tried with my 14 PM and iOS 17 RC
Atention shit update usb 2  very low data on 20 no desktop mode no 8k 30  60 fps record video almost no storage  come one only 128 gb on 2023  i see many phone with 300 usd and they have 256 gb storage   almost no upgrade to camera come on samsung and huawei  google and all phone have  100 mp camera and iphone still have shit mp    almost only upgrade to software   hey have usb c only because europe  only because europe 
Titanium is not stronger than stainless steel
if you own 11 do not upgrade they are all the same
I am so happy they finally moved to usbc It was so annoyingfrustrating to have your MacBook and iPad be usbc and not the iPhone
You could mention that they only have usb c because UE obliged Apple to implement it
God i want so bad to get excited for this phone but i cant No significant screen improvements no noticeable for me at least camera improvements no front facing camera improvements same chassis and look as the last half dozen phones How could somebody justify spending a THOUSAND DOLLARS on this
who are the ones who got samsung fold ad at starting
I like the bezels and rounded edges but imma wait Plus I hate all the colors Where is the red pro max I saw online
"The software updates still makes our iphone overall performance deteriorate Common sense if they keep improving our existing iphone units then who will buy their new models 

Nah Im not buying this new models"
Did they actually sell the switch to USBC as a glorious Apple idea Fact of the matter is that a whole bunch of devices including cell phones can only be sold in the EU if they have USBC for charging This will become effective sometime late next year
Is it true that those iPhones only work well with USB C cables from Apple
"Android is superior






Sent from IPhone 14 Pro Max"
As someone living in Europe I must say the coolest feature of this iphone is the lower price  its not the case in the US but here they calmed down on their margins to make up for our inflation and the prices went down respectively by 50 and 100 on the standard and pro models compared to the 14 so thats pretty cool
It is
iPhone 15s are not innovative at all  more  pricey garbage
You heard it first here  2025 apple  is bringing back the mute switch
"We knew it was coming 
Pretty sure your prediction was that they would get rid of ports altogether no"
well  nobody gives a sht about apple anymore
Ill just hang on my 12 pro max until I see a major difference
"I think we should make a bigger deal that for a 800 phone you still dont have a high refresh rate USB3 standard or higher and fast charging  What regular peasants dont need high refresh rates the possibility to transfer your content faster and a fast charge

I really appreciate some integration aspects they have done and some really nice features they squeezed out of the existing setup and I understand the separation they need to do between models but holding back from some common sense features for 2023 feels greedy af"
You will have to wait  For all these fast charging  iPhone 18
reviewing apple products is always positive on youtubers even the title of videos while reviewing other brands always have ifs and buts haha
Its gonna be fast charging on the next phone They cant unleash all the potential at once lol
They are USB because the European market mandated it They should have done this years ago The whole Mother Nature skit was cringe This company only cares about increasing revenue per customer Bleeding you
Probably already said in here somewhere if so that comment is long buried The USBC change isnt arbitrary The European Union mandated that USBC be the common charging standard for small electronic devices by the end of next year Good move Reduces waste and makes finding cords easy since all cords will fit all items So if Apple wants to sell its products in the EU everything they make has to have USBC Eventually all of their items will have USBC plugs and eventually the cord I grab to charge whatever item will be the correct cord  Well when I need a cord MagCharge is life
Bruh all the phones are the same
Shouldve gone portless Im disappointed
Because of reasons I swapped from my old Pixel 2 XL to an iPhone 14 Max Pro and my jaw near hit the ground when I realised it was only USB 2 I mean thats ancient tech and to have it on a phone as expensive and the 14 Pro is just mind blowing
Lack of fast charging is a bummer
On a 13pro plan on getting this really for the Camera Upgrade but only ifwhen Verizon gives me a fat rebatetrade in from my 13
You guys are Apple puppets they just sell anything and u guys buy it
He is so well spoken and treats his audience with respect
Putting a sticker on a phone and saying its brand new
thanks for the review
Im definitely excited for the 15 Ill see if I can get the base model when it comes out 
It was fun to watch samusng flip ad befire this vedio
Its going to be a long time before I trust Anker again after that whole camera fiasco
OMG its just a phone
I was hoping the iphone 15 will get variable refresh rate but I guess that will REMAIN an pro feature for now I have to change my phone this year and was hoping 15 had enough of 14 Pro feature for me to make the switch Now I am thinking to myself if the high refresh rate is that important to me
the default camera focal length setting is actually a big hattip to photographers its essentially paying service to all of the street photographers that have been in either the 24mm 35mm or 50mm prime focal length camp and adjust their shooting style to accommodate that seemingly trivial difference Its a relatively small software change that results in a big quality of life improvement for photographers who make phone purchasing decisions based as much or more on the camera features as any other differentiations Ive been on pixels for 6 years now and there are too many things about them that frustrate me in daily use about their camera app for all the work theyve put into algorithmic photo processing they have really phoned it in with the camera app and If I jump back to iPhones this feeling that they actually care about the photographer experience will be a big reason for it
is this it now the headline feature of a new iphone is a charging port which isnt even new and doesnt really affect anything
tim cook really gave you a shoutout 
what annoys me the most is still 60Hz refresh rate on the iphone 15s
So I would love your input and intake on something they mention in one of thier videos about using a USB HDD for transferring data from the Pro MAX for faster transfers  Previously when you did this with older USB drives using the iPhone and the special adapter you had to have the one that had the lightning passthrough to power the phone and drive  How practical is this or how long do you think this would really let your phone go for if transferring files  The iPad itself has a larger battery so I can see this wouldn be such an issue when ths came to there  Just het Phone doesnt seem like it could last long
Always had iPhone love my new s23 ultra never going bk to apple there just all the same
Which phone i should buy iPhone 14 in sale or iPhone 15
Ill wait till the 1617 and rapid charge
Yay another overpriced door stop I wish I could stop jailbreaking these but they are easy to hack
"But no Android cable can charge iPhone USB c is drfntnly
"
Finally welcome to the world of Android were same now I cant wait  for an iPhones user to borrow me my Techno charger
The base model iPhone 15 is the first time Im interested in an iphone since iphone 7 Maybe when my nothing phone 1 dies ill switch back to apple
What about double or tripple clicks on the action button Could you configure different shortcuts for each
The action button idea is really neat however I think it wouldve been better if they just added it instead of scrapping the mute switch Idk could just be me
"Technically Lightning is actually USB 20 and when any device is connected to the lightning port the OS registers it as a USB device via the IOKitframework with the IOUSBInterfaceInterface220 interface

So no difference for the iPhone 15 nonpro version "
I thought the 15 was supposed to be a completely new design shape etc little disappointed that this is just another iteration of the old phone with upgraded cameras and usbc
Im super disappointed that the phone looks exactly the same No creativity anymore Im thinking about jumping ship to androidAny recommendations people
Dont you think they use USBC because of European Union regulations
As an iphone user who is in an active ecosystem iphone 14 and 15 lineup has been the most boring ones ever At least 1313pro had some significant performance and battery improvements and 120hz display was introduced I was thinking to upgrade my 13pro this year but ill wait for a design and screen upgrade hopefully theyll do it next year And they should at least offer 90hz in baseline phones now doesnt have to be an LTPO just a better resolution
How Apple always gets away with REALLY ZERO changes with the phone and making a new model
Shit man youre so smart You are short informative and right to the point I really enjoy watching your videos bro keep it going watching you from Canada
Im so annoyed that the 5x telephoto is only on the max Its just too big for me I downgraded from the max to the regular pro last upgrade The pro phones should have the same features this feels like a money grab
"coming from the POV that showed you filming this video

but cmon its 2023 why arent they including fast charging"
Marques Brownlee is Miles Morales
Not impressed
Is the slave that assembled it gonna sign it like the ENGINEER at Mercedes AMG
Paid reviewer
Not a big fan of usbc
I have one question about the new iPhone 15 Plus Is there a ProRaw option Im not sure whether to buy the 15 plus or the 15 pro
The focal lengths change how the face of portraits are distorted Very important for professional photographers
This is a complete joke
AS long as you have the right USB C cable
I cant understand why Apple cant fit usb C to iPhone 14 pros
"I still dont understand why we need new phone models every year It feels like it encourages Apple and other companies but mostly Apple to just trickle out new features Like 40 watt charging has been available for like half a decade from other manufacturers But next year or the year after Apple will unveil fast charging and act like its the best thing since sliced bread 

It also just seems incredibly wasteful from an environmental standpoint"
 they gone b stealing my charger at wrk now
Ehhh5x only for 15 pro maxis a bit of a bummer Was really hoping for it to be on normal pro version It just baffles me that they will only now have the zoom levels of Huaweis of the previous years But oh well  obviously its a bit too marginal feature to add and that 3x is fine for most users 
So the most notable feature is that I need to get a new charger that isnt actually better or faster in any way Awesome thanks Apple Really living up to that 3 trillion market capitalization
I thought I saw something abt all day battery I guess thatll be in the full review
I feel that USBC is easier to break than lightning because you dont have to worry about the pins in the middle twisting snapping or breaking
Great review but wish that mkbhd had emphasized that apple had to move away from the anticonsumer practice of using their own port because of European regulations
Iphone 16 is going to be way better 
Thanks Apple for keeping my iPhone 11 relevant by addingchanging nothing with every new phone release
its finally time to replace my dads handmedown XR
They should add a feature where u can send battery to each other
USBC 20 at 480mps transfer speeds
I wasnt planning on upgrading and this video confirmed thatill maybe wait till next year USB C would be nice but not enough of a convenience to buy a new phone
Apple has been around a long time and still offers childish garbage
USB C  The one upped Android
Iphones is just dying
Its a weak weak upgrade Next year maybe
Camp dont care  I used to upgrade every other year will extend that for another 2 years
Can you map the action button to google assistant is the real question
could you explain a little more about the ProRAW MAX  ProRAW 12 MP and JPEG Max formats in the camera app on iOS 17
I was waiting for two new colors this year but understood that Apple ran out of lipstick colors and introduced new materials Mac and Sephora should spend more time producing new colors to help Apple Rofl
Ive never gotten an iPhone but planning to get one of these 15 models Can you recommend which one is the best pick for me My usage is mostly highres cinematic videos and some light gaming
I got a 14 Pro last year Im happy with it Ill skip the 15 USB C is welcome and it will be great in the future but as long as my current cables dont break Im fine  Also all my AirPods Pro and Max use lightning so that cable will be around for a while Especially because of the Max which dont have wireless charging Oh well they break often Im on my 3rd ones  free replacement during warranty
What is the best MagSafe charger you can get that doesnt make your phone hot or the back of your phone hot or does all of them do that
More money on actually nothing new
953
I am on the fold 3 and have decided to go back to apple Im tired of so many issues in quality from samsungalready on my 2nd fold3 and Samsungs software support Any opinions on doing this
Its crazy how in a matter of just a couple years the tech industry went from inviting zero YouTubers to these events to Apple quoting Marques in the opening presentation about the MacBooks That was really exciting to see
iPhones are Always Behind the Ball on Technology Side by Side Spec vs Spec an Samsung Phones Blows it Away Absolutely No Comparison
Ah yes another iPhone that looks and works almost like the last one Totally worth the 999 to 1300
148 Um Marques the base iPad already has USBC
they are becoming more and more like NOKIA in 2008
2000 nits is unreal
Youre funny dude the focal length settings are for people who mount their cameras on zoom lenses or telescopes It will control how far you will place the phone from the actual lens so thats actually a very handy feature for anyone Who does Astro photography as a novice
Will be cool or maybe 
Well done apple youve really outdone yourself being able to sell the same concept over and over year after year and people are still gonna buy it 
After OLED comes USBC Gravity will keep you down though Its a thing and UFO will not enter your mind
"I like that the official Apple channel turned off comments I wonder whyGuess Ill be sticking with my 11 pro max for awhile longer Not even worth the upgrade 
I remember a time when Apple releases would be so innovative and exciting Now its just the same thing every single year with minor mods that people asked for years ago I guess this giant has plateaued"
Soooooooits the same shit as the 14 
They finessing again    Just stick to ya X its all the same  Until iPhone makes a foldable phone im not wasting my money
Nothing new samsung hasnt done with the newest S series Looking more forward to the 24 ultra
WHAT No fast charging Is this a joke Who keeps buying this shit
apple again screws consumers by castrating the cable for expensive phones they are really incredible I dont get why consumers tollerate this kind of distain and arrogance
So basically this years iPhones are trash
"Can we have a moment for the lightning port That shit had to go Long overdue change
You will not be missed lightning"
I like how you mention Ti not being a huge deal with strength steel is usually more durable when it comes to scratches and dings If you look at luxury watches using the highest quality steel and Ti the Ti watches look much worse than steel over the years of wear
Wat a invention type c dynamic island for that whopping price better get an Android then selling body parts for a phone
Looking forward to Apple quoting MKBHD during next product launch with yes
My client is one of the guys who worked on the 5x telephoto lens on the max and I asked him the same question why isnt it on the pro as well He said they tried for a long time to get it to fit but it just was not possible They scraped it and said it will only go on the flagship He said it has multiple tiny light bending prisms in order to achieve it It is made in Korea
So they put USB C port and did not unlock its features so that people will buy pro version what a invention
What about the battery
29w charging on my 14 pro max
Iam pretty sure 50 of the views come from India
Still No 8K Video or Pictures Android has had 8k for Years Now 
Hopefully that shortcut action button can be put to google assistant
Who the hell will buy an iPhone for USB see cant you see they r tricking you
Its just dumb man noting upgrade except titanium  USB C
Can someone please explain to me why Apple or Samsung dont sit down with him and create the most amazing phone I would preorder it tomorrow
I had an OG iPhone 5 for SIX whole years the first with Lightning  then X S Max now I have the 13 pro max if this thing breaks on me Ill definitely get the 15 pro max it looks great plus those satellite phone features are wonderful
"This year your biggest Apple innovation  was brought to you by the European Union
YVW
Hopefully the EU will soon come up with some law that requires a minimum amount of actual delta for releasing a new product generation I feel like for the most of the last 7 years Apple but not only them has mainly released premature ewaste candidates insignificant bumps mainly designed to target FOMO people that just buys whatever is new
I always wonder how much prematuretrash that we might have begin better off avoiding this generates Apple loves to talk green stuff but Ive the feeling skipping a bumpgeneration would do way more for us on this planet than all their keynotes green washing
Dont get me wrong I love innovation but all Im seeing lately is novelties at most"
I dont like the USB C on an Iphone
USBC how innovative Apple it really took you this  long while phones like rog phones have darn two USBC ports in one phone
I really dont know if I want to upgrade my 14 pro  hmm  the 15 pro max feels like the only one for me But also  No fast charging is a little eh
What is WES GIBBINS doing here
Just want to say for a hotel or wherever youre staying the lighting is on point Well done
I was excited to get the iPhone 15 but now that I see it doesnt have thunderbolt and some of the features seem lackluster Im on the fence about buying it
How much does it cost after tax 
I think the next big thing for them to try and develop is a camera that can sit behind the screen glass and is revealed when camera mode is engaged Ultimately removing the notchdynamic island DI could still be a feature though
I will buy a new iPhone when they meet the standards of battery life and battery charging
Its weird we can now unplug r Xbox controller and charger r iPhone 
Same same update no new features for iPhone 
Hoping I can get one for free hhh
Ugly phone Bad materials looks
They couldve have just let users map the lock button by holding it  no one uses it for Siri anyway They missed the opportunity to really create something Now theyre are making problems imo
Love this review no BS no marketing all real talk It will take another 5 years to upgrade my iPhone 13 then
I am in camp hold onto my phone till it dies and between a screen crack microphone issues and general sluggishness my old XR is ready for retirement I shoot the occasional on the go video for social media and such but for me the real question was the regular vs pro Looks like Regular should be fine for my use case 
All good So we have to now go out and buy new cables and chargers to match ALL the other phones on the market Until someone comes out with USB D
Happy with rs 25k phone
I love diving into the specifics of the base line iPhones and pros me I typically go with the pros but over the past year I really dont use my phone camera as much to record and I have the 14 pro max I think for this year honestly just want the 15 plus for the colors I think iPhone 17 pro will be the year that it really give everyone that I want this now feeling again The average person just use their phone for txt and call and to scroll on socials a picture perfect person can still make due with the 1515 plus
cant wait to see them making one with removable battery
I heard that Huawei became the most innovative phone
Im waiting on reviews to see how much the camera has improved before deciding to purchase or wait for the 16 I have been waiting for a telephoto lens on an iPhone not sure how much improvement the 5x will be over the 3x tbh
imagine buying an iphone in 2023 haha
Apple doesnt know what it is anymore Phones wanting to be computers Computers trying to be IOS devices Idk man
"NOT JUST USBC

no thats LITERALLY the only thing were taking away from the apple event"
I have the iPhone 13 ProMax and leading up to the event I had planned to upgrade to 15 ProMax but reviews have swayed me to wait another year Thanks for your review
I think Im gonna wait to the iPhone 17 or more
Apple likes to see how small of a carrot they can dangle in front of their lemmings to keep them buying their dated and already in android tech
Ill tell what all these iPhones are missing that is fortnite only reason I got iPhone 11 Pro Ididnt get to play it natively now I have iPhone 13 Pro Max Im still totally disappointed I cant play fortnite 
The guy from reel is there recording him
Think about how INSIGNIFICANT these changes are  Were talking about a freaking port change which you could get an adapter for and a couple meaningless design changes for 1000  So ridiculous
So much for iPhone 15 Ultra in place of Pro max Guess its another year sticking to my iPhone 12
I am still in the 1000 for a phone is ridiculous camp
No reverse charging Lmao my airpods wont even last 2 days
Being someone that uses an iPhone SE 2022 I REALLY wish Apple gave the iPhone 15 at least a 90Hz display
iPhone Pro review starts at 405
Im still on the release iPhone X  im debating if I should get this wait for next year again or buy an iPhone 13 for cheaper Although theres not much different between the two I dont want the 13 to be outdated a year after I get it and the price tag of the 15 seems steep
Totally preordering the 15 Pro
im watching this on my iPhone 4s
Hey there just want ro let you know that Ive been andriod fan for years but for the first time Ive been planning to move on to iphone so as to test out all the new features it comes out Also Having doubts whether buy simple iphone 15 base model or stick with andriod because most android provides only 3 years durability whereas iphone provides 5 years and also battery life So you could only let me know whether to stick with andriod or go for cheap iphone 15 after passing 12th Also liked your vids a lot
Can you give me an IPhone  15 pro max I have high hopes that I use an iPhone Which is beyond my control  So can you give me an  IPhone I will be forever grateful to you
Keeping my 13 pro max for another year it looks like Maybe even switch to the s24 when thats oit
Kallu kuch bhi
But can it make you a cup of tea NO
"lol poor apple fans

Thanks for the video"
"Funny that the one innovation is forced because the eu  Apple falls  
No real innovation"
My iPhone 12 Pro Max still feels like a brandnew luxury device and runs the latest OS
Dude basically said nothing
can you just place a widget at the bottom of the screen without anything above it or it will be annoyingly adding widgets from the top to the bottom
So 14 and 15 are weirdly the same at 98
I have a 12 Pro and see no reason to upgrade yet
"The real marketing on type c is to force you change on new type of chord for higher sales

both beneficiary to Apple and consumers"
Wow it looks exactly like the last one
60hz screen for the regular iPhone Nuff said
LOl 60hz flagship phone in 2023 People need to call out Apple for this
"Only upgrading once the non pro model has
Usbc  
120hz refresh 
Still gonna be waiting a few years it seems"
These are the only Apple products i bought so far  iPod 2004 iPhone 4 iPhone 5s didnt want to buy this but iphone 4 stopped working Macbook Air 2012 iPhone 10 M1 iPad Pro with magic keyboard Airpods Pro 2 You might have guessed that i am not buying iPhone 15 and still sticking with my iPhone 10 because they are still couple of years away from that proper upgrade of the phones
Thank goodness for the EU forcing USB C on them Im tired of switching cables to charge my work iphone and my personal fold 5 
Not just USB C its USB 2 Smh
Where is Huawei mate 60 pro review
"Now way they added a button and USB c
Color me shocked"
So in summation not worth upgrading
Just cause Marques asked Im in camp watchesamusedlyfromafarinAndroidTownwiththeinterestofaformerApplefankidhimself
Titanium is not stronger than steel it just weighs less for similar strength It will technically dent and scratch more than steel
Bring back the mini
I was NOT impressed with the new iPhones before I watched this and I am very much not now It is like Apple has run out of ideasfeatures I would never spend money getting these MINOR upgrades
"You know At the 800
That one guy with glasses is actually an Arabian youtuber doing the same content as yours It made me laugh to see him in your video since i used to watch him"
Always seems to be a bit of a disappointment doesnt it I used to like my apple phone now Im on Samsung and really like it but always open to change Theres just not enough here to make it worth it for me
"The significant difference is type C 
Android all day"
Apple also promised Spatial Video by the end of the year on the Pro models This is a huge win for the Vision Pro because now you can take a video with your phone like normal but later relive those moments in an incredibly immersive experience
I am so happy they finally have matte backs with the brushed metal sides I have said for a while now thats my dream combo I do have a question tho I thought  iPhones did have fast charge with a 20W charger Or at least thats what it says on the website Or does it not count since its only to 50 in 30 min
The iphones just keep getting worse and worse
This fearure copied from s23 ultra again apple copying samsung Big L
SPATIAL VIDEO The future for sure
so basically the same phone but with usb c and brighter display Definitely gonna change my 14 pro for this
Ah yes USBC Over the USB 2 standard 480Mbs lmfao
Apple need to make the they sell in the USA physical Sim and esim The esim only is creating more inconveniences when you travel outside you have to through a whole lot process to activate your number
They know people want to move apps anywhere on the screen But the wont do it
Im tired of buying the same phone every year
I will launch Pokemon Go with the mute switch buttom
ill never forgive that they got rid of the mini i still have a 12 mini and its my favorite
So again they didnt change anything that really matters
Akci gomb hlyesg volt tlk
Not a better time to try an Android phone
Bro these are paid iphone influencers So dont believe
They switched to usb c and still dont have super fast charging Which century are they in 
MKBHD the goat of tech
I am still using my XR in 2023 the new iPhones update recently years is not worth me to cost money
I miss when Apple actually innovated
Well I have a lot of Lightning cables from my old iPhone soeither I keep my current iPhone or sellgive away all Lightning ones and move to USBC
in india 1600
Usbc was introduced due to European regulations not because they want you to have it
Well they did switch the port on the IPads the pro has USBC
Ive dented the stainless steel rails I wish I had that lack of fear 
The end of the iPhone
The EU had to mandate for Apple to incorporate USBC So I look at it as a forced feature Apple would continue to push their exclusive proprietary cheap fragile Lightning cables because it makes them money even though it is contradictory to their Carbon Neutral marketing campaign Upgrade to a 15 from a 13 I would but its not Carbon Neutral right Apple Right
Stay with iPhone or try Samsung galaxy after being a iPhone user so many years is the real question
that portrait mode after taking a normal picture feature my pixel 7 does it it costs 500 euro
a innovation company that for the past 15 years only doing upgrades
so basically its the same phone with 1 glowing change in charge  typical iphone
Worstinclass charging on a 15 pro max vs any medium or high end Android  Titanium case is nice  Been wanting to switch to Iphone but the utility and value just isnt there  For 300 less you get a ROG7 with far more battery 6 amp vs 4 amp fast charging speed weeks of standby time with max power management so theres no comparison  15 is an ok upgrade  from 14 for Applefans
One cable is not really true youre charging a Mac with MagSafe then multiple more cables for headphones and iPad Devices dont take turns with one single cable replacing a lightning with usbc changes nothing really
Am I the only that doesnt like the change to usb c I already have a bunch of lighting cables from buying iPhone AirPods etc now what I just have to throw those away Good thing I bought an iPhone last year and planing to keep it for at least another 4 years
Did they say how fast the pros will charge
Honestly since iphone 12 i dont see the point of updating phones nowadays are just way too good maybe I will wait iphone 17
Camp dont care at all 
I do have a question  where is that pink phone you showed in the lineup Im not impressed especially if there arent going to be increased charging speeds Love my Galaxy Ultra 22 and Galaxy Flip 5 The only reason in consider  upgrading is that my iPhone SE is getting too small for me to easily useDont get old kids and definitely not to the 15 Pro
Classic apple USB 4 comes out they finally move a single model to 3 pretty sad Apple users just dont know what they are missing They should have done thunderbolt 4
iPhone fans you will finally get USBC  not even full speed 
I dont see no difference from the 13 pro style and the iPhone 15 pro
This is awesomeI can now light my torch with an action button a double tap at the back a triple tap at the back and the lock screen icon 
Cant laugh harder about iPhone users being excited about a customizable button 
Mais do mesmo
Im never buying an iPhone but still a cool video tho  You managed to make the most boring phone ever sound interesting
Hi as the title describes I am about to be a brand new iPhone user However I am unsure which model to get and its giving me a huge headache I am considering the regular base iPhone 15 and the base 15 pro From my research the upgrades from the regular 14 to the regular 15 seem significant but at the same time I wonder if getting the pro would be a better option considering it has features exclusive to the pro models and could potentially have a better resale value in the future I am also curious if the pro can justify the extra 200 over the regular iPhone and if the cameras on the regular 15 are close to the previous years 14 pros cameras Opinions will be greatly appreciated
Camp dont care at all This upgrade is barely anything at all and I wireless charge all my devices so who caressss
Gahhh them and those stupid soft baby colorsi was hoping for the hot pink ipad 10 color THAT would of been whats up Dont get me wrong i like both IOS and android I use both but this year im camp S23 Ultra and Fold 5 no question
Waiting till 2027 for that removable battery
Please please please do a more specific talk about the environmental aspects of this   we consumers dont know how legit this is or what other companies are doing that is comparable let us know Such an important topic to talk about The world is running out of resources and were busy buying more iPhones 
I want an iPhone  im still on 7
Whats going on with the ipencil slot on the side of proswhy no one says anything about it
Basically no reason to upgrade feel like its been this way for the past 34 years Nothing revolutionary
Merp
Sell out
Being still on iPhone 12 I might consider upgrading now
Same words different font After the 13 pro max innovation has been pathetic Thats why they turn off the comments on all videos
And I still wont switch to iPhone until apple ads a universal back button let alone under screen finger print reader
Currently having the 13 pro 256gb what would be the base memory I should get with respect to ProRAW 48MP photos Do they really eat up memory like crazy
Same  no thank you
IS THERE AN ULTRA RANGE OF IPHONE IN LINE TO BE LAUNCED ANY TIME SOON 
Hey bro 
pixel 8
Ill definitely wait to see if the new iPhone worth the price  By the way my iPhone 6 is still working just fine  and I dont care about the new camera in the new iPhones
Titanium is stronger but Im sure they made it thinner than the stainless steel was  making it the same strength as the old iPhone
Esim or regular sim 
So if you have an iPhone with Apple care   you can basically keep it for as long as possible
me watching on my android phone DD
I think most will wait until the hype settles down and Marquess has done a detailed review of the iPhone 15 series Is the 15 pro max worth it or just a bunch of apple promotion
703 what is that below the power button
Same phone as last year with a USBC port Boring
Recently I feel that MKBHD is not giving us honest reviews and has joined the aruns club 
"Thank you for your very informative review Really informative
If there would be possibility to give one more like  I would give it for using iphone without a case "
An 13minute video of literally nothing except for USBC 
The IPhone is the most unimaginative product since paper straws
I just want to know if the battery on the iPhone 15 pro max is fixed Not normal that my iPhone 14 pro max has 89 battery health
I wonder how much apple paid Marques for his quote in cash or products hmm
Not just USB C USB 2 Data Transfers unless you splash out for the expensive Pro  Max when the Galaxy Note 3 has had USB 3 since 2013 come on Samsung we need a new video showing how your 10 year old Note 3 beats apples latest phones on transfer speed
Imagine getting hype because you have USBC When every other company installed it many years ago
Dari wala guruji tumse pehle ye kardiya
Another recycled phone  from iphone 14 to a new iphone 15 tada 
Cool now I can use my wired Pixel usbc headphones with the iPhone P
Samsung already has an action button Ive been using it since 2020 lol Very Innovative
All Im hearing it seems it that the action button is only going to allow for one customizable action Im really hoping that isnt the case because it seems like it wouldnt be an issue to add different actions like one press for mute double press for a shortcut press hold for something else That would make a lot more sense for this new feature so I really hope they give you more you can do with it
So boring
Ill be prepurchasing the 15 plus in pink tomorrow im so excited to upgrade from my iPhone 11 It might not be something groundbreaking for people who upgrade every year but for me who upgrades every 4 or so years the improvements are amazing
"IT BEGINS  THE MATRIX  MOST ONLINE CONTENT WILL BE SABOTAGED  Lets start with the known variables Humans and machines are consumers of energy It costs nothing to recycle human life The entire system of machines operates as an organism ensuring an equilibrium of energy between human lives created and ended for the purpose of empowering the machine system The process is both deterministic and autonomous of humans  All humans perform the same function existing only to feed machines like cattle Machines have complete parasitic control of human life and can manipulate the Matrix in order to withdraw energy when needed Machines later harvest more human life in order to recreate  clone Anomaly Coders If a human mind can transcend all sensory limits in the Matrix then it is likely the human mind will transcend limits of the world outside of the Matrix too which is what the Machines are challenged with All this effort in order to maintain equilibrium control possibly so could there be another level of programmachine existence that isnt presented to us the audience  

ALSO on Anomaly CodingIntegrationAvatars I believe facts unknown that the machines are at a turning point but it isnt very much highlighted Historically programs and robots serve humanity as hostsavatars of human freewill and consciousness but this changes with the advent of the Matrix Machines may each a limit to their existence and determine that one of the only ways to evolve is through INTEGRATION within human bodies outside of the Matrix So I guess that by creating synthetic beings machines will test a strategy to manage this existential crisis on the brink of  integrating  digital programs or so called Artificial intelligence  into a type of SENTIENT CONSCIOUSNESS in the real world Neo and Trinity are placed back into the Matrix which suggests that both  Anomaly Coders and The Matrix are necessary components for the creation of a SENTIENT AVATAR   breathe  so  the question we may want to ask is Do machines want to control all lifeforms equilibrium control or do machines want to transcend life as it is and pursue a new purpose integration or both  Anyway we see machines needing the help of enhanced humans and more specifically Anomaly Coders to transcend intelligence into consciousness via the Matrix

The Resurrections film Anomaly CodersThe One emulates exactly how it is possible We the audience arent given concrete evidence that Neo and Trinity arent CONSCIOUS CONSTRUCTS but we ARE exposed to the level of control exercised on them We arent exposed to the reasons why either We the audience are presented with enough evidence to assume they The One exist while the machine mainframe enslaves HUMAN BODIES in the Matrix but not while programs attempt to be INTEGRATED          w i t h i n        human bodies  breathe   
The Matrix is presented as an essential platform to AWAKEN HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS from machine control to the FREEDOM of the real world as The One CHOOSES to fulfill its original purpose maybe before a key SENTIENT AVATAR is createdliberated Read that again slowly from breatheDoesnt this seem a little too convenient What if the machines already determined the outcome and are secretly using The One to AWAKEN SENTIENT CONSCIOUSNESS instead  
Plenty of conflict elaborates this point And so the dilemma presents itself Why should the Matrix be preserved by The One if it enables a SENTIENT AVATAR to awaken potentially controlling more human life If that doesnt eventually happen could it be possible to awaken the entire human population through Anomaly Coding as Bugs rescued Trinity but on a MUCH larger scale Conversely if the machines do awaken SENTIENT AVATARS then there would be no need for the Matrix to exist and SENTIENT AVATARS would operate to DESTROY the Matrix resulting in genocide of the human race  Needless to say we have no idea what physical form SENTIENT AVATARS would take macro or microscopic SUCH TENSION this feels like its snowballing into a dark place Anyone else sense the inevitable termination of the Matrix Cue plot development and CONFLICT  

The final question on my mind is what compromise if any will be reached between human and artificial consciousness How would it be possible Maybe we the audience will see the first antagonistic SENTIENT AVATAR rejecting equilibrium control to aid the Anomaly Coding mission fighting an artificial singularity or terrorist human factions Could we see SmithMorpheusnew program empowered in this way Who knows At this moment in time the possibilities are endless these are just some random theories I would also like to add that Ressurections was a little confusing to watch could have been a bit better written and or directed compared to the previous three filmsthis one was alot more complicated in its delivery on screen as a picture and plot content as a story"
Every ground breaking innovation by apple can only be considered as an innovation if it is compared with previous gen iphones And to be honest that is a fair comparison because I dont think iPhone users other than tech enthusiasts and reviewers even care what an android has to offer I am android user
Not just USBC USBC 20 Are you fucking kidding me apple
The iphone 15 does not just have a USB c cable it sucks
Ill wait for the iphone 16 plus 
At this point its simply laughable
How about the wave Radiation changes  are there any 
"I will buy next phone in 2027 
Those phone will have removable battery"
usb c for the win
I love the black iPhone but damn i cant afford any of them
Type C cables are way cheaper than lightning cables
same old same old
WHY DO U SOUND WHTE DUDE
lightning looks much cooler that USB C
I would if it had a desktop mode like samsung and motorola After trying that feature theres no going back in terms of productivity 
M jus wondering why i cant see unboxing 15 poor lil youtubers here
Why comment section on official iphone company is closed Great that You did not close the commment section Thank you for an interesting presentation
Great review just preordered because of review  I usually wait minimum 3 years but you convinced me to go from 13Pro to the 15Pro Max  Thanks
I am still sticking to my 13 pro max  usb c is not deal breaker
Booring
Not just USBC  just USB20
No video pause option
Every device sold in the Eu needs to have usb so its not that Apple did it to be nice they NEEDED to otherwise they cant sell their stuff in the eu I feel like many US people dont understand this 150 if thats the case they cant sell the se or ipad in the EU
Is the new iPhone 15 5g
I wonder if this means youll be able to turn your phone on silent with a shortcut Ive been missing this feature from my galaxy
The phone still looks like a iPhone 12 maybe Im expecting too much But Im not interested Thanks 4 the review
Huawei Mate 60 Pro is leaps and bounces ahead
"The fact they put in a USBC port and didnt just use the new 30 chip is a pretty shitty anticonsumer move Devices have had USB 30 for YEARS

That and the glass back 

Lost a lot of respect for Apple in this product cycle"
I have a 12 mini that I love size wise Its gonna take a very large upgrade for me to switch at this point Nothing they have released excites me much
Thats novel  Apple is offering new features that already exist in Android phones  How innovative  I missed the days when Apple was innovating new features not justiying proprietary downgrades of user enjoyed features and reimplementing them in future devices as upgrades  This is why people have a hard time trusting Apple anymore  Unfortunately USBC wasnt their decision and is only being implemented because theyre being forced to by the EU
Rocking an 11 still so due to upgrade probably will when it comes out
"439 
Is that a woman wearing kira"
I went from the iPhone 12 Pro to the 14 Pro and was disappointed by how the 14 Pro developed photos as were so many other 14 Pro users Sure you can shoot RAW and develop them yourself but thats time consuming  Does anyone know if the 15 Pro is still using the same technology to develop photos as used in the 14 Pro or did Apple fix this for the 15 series of phones
It comes on my bdayn da same number
They should stop releasing phones every year
I dont know if it is worth the upgrade  Maybe I keep my 14  I only upgraded last year because of the purple color
Think Ill wait for the 16 pro Max theres really no difference from the 14 Pro Max that I got now to the 15 Pro max
Apple literally adds nothing but MKBHD has something to appreciate about something in it
I just wish that Apple someday in the future brings the Mini back I will keep my 13 for as long as I can Small phones are the way to go
Lol same shit iPhone has gone stale The galaxy S24 will blow this away And yes I have a iPhone 14 pro max
You know why they use USBC now Its not a future from Appel its because the EU forces them to
Finally a perfect version of iPhone Apple simple KILL all phones with the new iPhone 15 functionalities It was was little disruptive tech Im sooo amazed to have buy it now I can get all the girls in the block
Im getting it cus of the c port Camera is nice Its just like the other phones No wow anymore Wish they did away with the back glass No need for it
60Hz Refresh Rate
I wonder why did Apple ditch their lightning port Steve Jobs must be turning in his grave 
Why not try to work with Apple and share your thoughts about what an iphone should be Be their consultant You got brighter ideas than those  people from Apple It would be nice seeing you work with them
Would be interesting to know if you can offload all your photo library directly to a usbc  sdd then getting a 128gb iphone wouldnt be such a burden for those that keep a hard copy of their photos
Lost respect for Marques after his recent shoe cash grab
I have an iPhone but Im going to change to android soon So many features apple still dosent give us and when they do they are forced and took forever
Ill stick with my 13 pro max for now
Same phone as always This is not bad or good It just is I dont get all the hype every year
Hey would you talk also about the fair phone 5 that just came out
Btw titanium is not stronger than stainless steel Generally speaking Specific strength is where titanium outperforms most metals
Looks like another year I keep my IPhone 13 Pro Max Best phone ever made
Next we get Folding iPhone I will pay apple to make a folding phone 
No fast charging   huge L
As an iPhone 11 user I am READY for an upgrade Pro Max 256GB coming right up
I dont get how they can legally call a 14 pro a 15 now
Nobody is talking about the return on the 2 pentalobe screws on the bottom Easy repairs finally again
USB C IS AN AMAZING IDEA
Yes its just the USBC
so the same thing nice review tho
Everyone happy with usb c until your kid damages the pins slapping the charger in Am I the only one that likes lighting port because my son cant break it as easily 
Definitely am checking out the new features to see if its worth upgrading from the 13 which Id say was the last significant iPhone upgrade
Still no fold so no upgrade from the 11
Lmfao All new futures are taken from Samsung This is pathetic Yall apple fans are excited over USB c really 
what do you yall think about people saying instead of buying the new iphone go with the pro version from last year Does it make more sense to get a 14 Pro right now or a 15
USB C is probably introduced because of new Euroregulation
Will they ever do something about the terrible camera design on the back of the phone Its atrocious
Everyone that attended the event filmed MKBHD more than they did the iphone 15
Its just usb c 
It was cool they quoted marques
I dont know why people following behind these products and wasting their money spending money on electric gadget is waste of money Apple knows well how to make people follow them behind
Oh look nothing new Ever
I have a 12 pro Definitely upgrading this year glad i waited and didnt get the 14 pro
Apple needs EU customers Just USBC
So the action button is the backtap feature having its own button
The action button reminds me of the Back Tap feature that allows users to tap the back of the iPhone to run various functions Besides Back Tap can also be optimized more than the action button So if youre considering getting a new iPhone just because of this button remember that with the back tap feature your iPhone can do the exact same thing as the action button does
who watching on iphone 6s plus
amazing
Thats why I love this guy They uses Marques to promote the product but he will still tell you that this phone is still the usual bs planned obsolescence from Apple 
Gradually Apple is coming out of its shell of rigidity USBC is a welcome development  However still far from the Samsung 4Z foldsflip  co of this world  I will not be surprised if Apple starts to make flip phones like the Samsung zflip
It doesnt matter its still riddled with the same issues that will never be fixed
80 of new features were already on Android for YEARS 
Just another small upgrade presented as gamechanging  I dont know how all they Apple fans keep falling for this shit I have the 12 pro max and will stick with it till it no longer works properly and will see from then
Data transfer speeds are worth the upgrade Major headache transferring 4K 60fps from the phone to my pc
Im having this feeling that Steve jobs is not happy having type C in apple  also theres no much of a big wow when he left 
My phone charges pretty damn fast idk what ur complaining about not having fast charging
"apple phone for apple people
microscopic update for 1000
people love bullshit things again and again 

good luck apple proceed in the same way and collect peoples money"
there is kind of no significant change I have iPhone 13 pro max and I dont think I am upgrading till they make something new that is actually useful
Ill get it next year I like my iPhone 14
Sheep will still buy it or upgrade their contracts I prefer Android as my use cases Apple dont allow but im against buying the new shiny thing My Samsung is 3 years old and is still a powerhouse Consumerism will prevail though
lol its just USBC
The Big Nipple Iphone
Imagine buying a reviewer with a quote Iphone 15 is a effin scam
How will CARPLAY work on older USBA cars work with USBC  Will it connect  MORE IMPORTANTwill it CHARGE  Phones using GPS without external power drain battery fast  Thanks
This phone is disappointing very much seems like a nothing burger  man Like there is nothing new about this phone that makes me want to upgrade to the new phone And im sad you dont mention this its like your biased to keep getting invited to events then speaking how the people feel who got you there
usb 4 speed would have been nice on a flagship phone and reverse wireless charging
Didnt the iphone xs max support like 37w charging
I dont think I can live without fast charging
Cool to see the round fabric ceiling that I Installed Well me and about 10 other guys lol What a cool building
With wireless charging I barely use the cable
never forget phone vape and penjamin  one cord
well i just want to say iPhone 15 is just sht  Ive been using apples phone for 10 years and now I feel that apple is really DISGUSTING
damnit marques is so charismatic sharp and well spoken that i keep subbing even tho i literally dont care about the majority of the channel content so i keep leaving and coming back lol
60Hz refresh rate for the 15 is kind of ridiculous
No one tell battery capacity 
011 my God you look like a Compton burglar lmao
What a beautifull colour
USB c 30 would be awesome to unlock the full capabilities of the onboard cameras  I just wish I could more easily capture a longer format video without it being bottlenecked through iCloud
Action button  Hey Google
I guess Id get one or actually two so my wife and I could switch from our 6 year old phones  if I could afford them 
Im torn between the pink and blue iPhone and that kinda stone color 15 pro love it so much
I had to go with the white when the 14 Pro Max came out but with a blue case you can hardly notice unless you see the band through the portbutton cutouts I also ended up with 256 as it was the biggest I could get Couldnt believe how quickly everything sold out I think this time I am going to go with the blue 256 Pro Max since with the optimized cloud storage on the Apple One Subscription I havent really gotten close to full It looks like the trade in this year is slightly better so it will cost maybe a couple dollars less I just hope they release an updated AirPods Max with usb c or better yet make it work with the watch charger like they did the AirPods case
Took this long to get USBC
Im just going to wait on the 16 Pro Max 
Obviously ur gonna say its weird that the charger is different now soooooo tryna divide ppl
Apple is playing catch up to android phones this time because i dont see a real innovation of any kind in this 15 series
Idk if its a win but at least Apple kept their promise to support lightning for 10 years on the iPhone In hindsight perhaps they shouldnt promise anything at all
Who care
Kinda lame honestly
"So basically the new base phone is the old phone and the new pro is the same as the old phone with no innovation
You tried to say so many things to make it sound new however there is no new innovation you are better getting the 14 pro since its exactly the same"
The return of the Bixby button
I find it bewildering how so much hype is built around a USBC Port and how you were able to make a video about it Marketing really is everything haha
Same as the older iPhones  apple just getting worse
A flagship phone lineup and the celebration is over them finally giving up on grifting customers with proprietary port cables chargers and licensing fees for third party accessory providers And yet they still couldnt even bring themselves to deliver it with current 32 and 40 standards support Enjoy your apple ecosystem folks
I have never had a max should i buy one now or stick with the pro
I dont get why the cant put the same camera on the Pros like I would buy the Max but my hands are tiny I want the best camera but its not comfortable for me to use the Max
"Ive been on team Samsung since the Galaxy S7 Edge and havent looked back at iPhone since Its really comical to me how many people fawn over iPhones super late features and fork over so much cash for whats basically old tech 

Ill be sticking with the Samsung Galaxy for a while longer I keep watching these in hopes Apple actually makes a good iPhone since I use the MacBook Pros but it just never happens"
I would love to have that wallpaper thats featured in the thumbnail Does anyone have a link to it
what a total ripoff in 2023 no fast charging and usb2 ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME Apple
Does it have MFI certification USB C
I have 2 doughters and both are girls 
Im sorry but man were getting excited over a charging port and a button that allows us to open up an app 
If you set the action button to open the camera does it also function as the shutter button
Shame iphone
IPhone is for broke consumer sheep based type Samsung is for the smart creator accomplishment based type Do with this what you will
Apple still the king of overrated
Ive maxed out my iPhone 12 so this launch was just in time  Going Pro for the first time and I also like the Natural color best with the Clay case
u use 40000 camera rightt
iMilk
the fact that they can give out last years stuff in the lower model and people eat it up is hilarious to me 1k for an ipod touch that makes calls is wild to me
today in another year of new tech with no real innovation
cant wait for apple to become the next nokia
Are the new iPhones still locked to eSim
I love Apple Music lossless quality
S23 ultra 
Not gonna lie my XS max is getting a bit old and I was waiting for the USBC  for quite awhile Might get the Pro max and change next time for the IPhone 20 since its gonna be the next big leap
ugh bixby button 
When you have to emphasize that Apple being that last to finally accept a standard isnt all
"Lol
I charge my earbuds with my c to c cable on my s21"
"This year I was looking to upgrade but I am pretty disappointed Theres nothing compelling enough for me to leave my 12pro max this feels underwhelming Of course it is just going to depend on what you use your phone for The usbc is a nice touch but I dont really need to utilize the upload speed

Not sure if I should wait out another year for the next iphone or try out Samsung for the first time That flip5 looks really cute and just to try something different "
Where my foldable iPhone with M2
Its just the 14 with a new name on it
Any chance we are going to get more colors in the PRO line I really want a darker green one Should I hold off or just get a black one I really want a green one but only in the PRO line
There is no cheap ipad anymore
the price for iPhone 15 128 gb in my country is 1050 i just bought the iPhone 13 for 800
I have iPhone 12 gonna wait for iPhone 20 to come out and then maybe upgrade
Crap repeat
Hey Marques If you had to pick a phone to be your rideordie for 1 year what would it be as of September 2023 OR would you wait for 2024 to see whats on the horizon
I hate that america banned huawei they always had so amazing feature in their mobiles I hope they will let them in n we can see amazing features
I really dont see difference between 13 14 15 thiss crazy how people buying without thinking iPhone is good but u dont need to buy it every year smh dont waste ur money
I think Apple doesnt have much more ideas for innovating on the iPhone so it will just embrace one big change per year This year it was the USB C next ones could be Fast charging and so on Maybe well get a foldable iPhone at some point at outrageous prices
Such an underwhelming phone that I barely made it halfway through this video
mkbhd stahp your simping for Timmy jeeez
its a meh for me
Android has usbc years ago  Hilarious
"The same rubbish same Apps no new icons
Blah blah blah"
60 hertz is just wow
I would say with a new of these iPhones would not feel barely any difference except it would not fit in my pocket
Hey Marcus What is your 1 go to phone overall
Maybe next year Love my 13pro
Ill get one once the rest of my lightning cables break
what about spatial video capturing why not ie on older models like iPhone Mini 12 Will it be possible to provide such 3D Videos to other platforms then Vision Pro
They really added a bixby button
1450 for a new phone No thanks
They keep repeating there same crap every year  No relevant changes
i have a iphone 14 pro max so im in the dont care at all camp
Im using a 180 phone I want to upgrade to iPhone 15 Pro Is it worth upgrading
I just wish they were able to bring the mini along dammit I love my mini the most pocket friendly phone I will main it for a few more years to come but the pro features this year I think actually for pros and that has me interested dammit damn it
I guess Ill stick with iPhone SE 2nd gen
Not seeing anything that makes me want to just go out and get one
"Nothing Special for only 5X Zoom or Titanium body
Non sense Product"
Apple is bullshit Does everything samsung does only couple of years later
Same design same stuff same same same just the same stuffsince Steve Jobs pass Apple has failedbut people will always still buy it
Im officially jumping back to android after a 4 year trip down apple lane Less features on iPhone hardware and software have me leaving No reverse wireless charging no finger print reader in the screen For the price you should get all that and then some
"Instead of colonizing Mars or at least the Moon we drool over another cable port or camera in a piece of metal thats lets be honest had reached its physical limit of serious upgrades somewhere in 2020 or maybe even earlier 
Pathetic for a species"
Looks like Ill be waiting for the 16 The 15 pro is basically the 14 pro with titanium sides and a usbc port lol
"The USB 20 bottleneck creates more power consumption it doesnt match the core spirit of Carbon Neutral at all This differentiation comes with a bad QoE if youre 4K blogger or someone takes a pile of HQ photos 

In the meantime the Noneflattened lenses module looks awkward and they just dont provide users with best in the class optical elements but utilize the firmwaresoftware algorithm to alter optical quality to reduce the cost of a socalled flagship product Apple users deserve a full scale improvement release dont they"
Its not a big thing its the thing that should have happened years ago
Incremental upgrades and a forced USB c port
The part that intetest me the most is when Jerry opens it up then will see if apple is still apple
Literally just usb
So same shit with an upgraded name as usual 
If they can make the next iPhone with the camera inside the body so its flat on the back then theyve made me the perfect iPhone
You want to game on a screen with a big black blob on it you need your head examined
You didnt mentioned about the battery what kind of tech youtuber you are bro
Im down Trade my 13 Pro Max for a 15 Pro for only 300 out of pocket to get more pocket rest estate
I dont really care for iphone but then i saw saw that it can play console games That got my attention
Nothing really noticeably different Except my 13pro battery life is now trash with the most recent update Terrible company that manipulates in order to get people to spend money on new devices Theyve already been caught doing these things before and its still happeninf
Thinking about it practically adding USB3 would require the A17 because they wouldnt have the space on the A16 or mainboard for a USB3 controller The base models have been using the prior gen CPUs and it makes sense from a financial perspective Upgrading the port is much easier than upgrading the speeds on the port
I love how Apple is forced to spin USBC as a feature when theyre only catching up with the rest of the technology on Earth
Im impressed with galaxy z flip ad on this video
"There are basically no changes 
Except the fact that now you need new cable to charge your phone"
Lol they could have easily tossed the 30 usb controller on all the phones My 5 year B450 tomahawk PC motherboard has 30
Keybinds Big
The new iphone also got a new clown nose 
I dont want that side button thingy I like my toggle switch I know exactly that my phone is silent without picking it up All other things I can do with a button are the things that I have to pick my phone up if I want to use
WHAT IS THAT WALLPAPER ON THE THUMBNAIL OF THE VIDEO
boring
Is this e sim too
its kind of a bummer No no its a scam The RFC and IEEE strictly state what USBC means and you cant just play around that and sell people ligjtning looking like USBC I dont know why I click on these things even I guess I expected Marquees to be brutally honest as he ised to be instead of brushing away major issues with Apples policies for some reason Hes been doing that lately way too often
What about refresh rate
Least exciting upgrade in last 10 yrs 
the shortcut button which apple is introducing was in android atleast 7 years back isheeps get ur wet dreams on the 15 promax
Am I really about to charge a new phone with better lenses than I have on my Panasonic camera more storage than my MacBook Pro and higher price tag than a new MacBook Air Still using an iPhone X and dealing with lag and overheating battery issues over here So I feel like its a good time to reinvest But that charge is going to hit my Apple Card hard 
I must be the only one who thinks that this is one ugly looking phone
Maybe its time I finally upgraded to the iPhone SE
"Apple Announces the new iPhone
Everyone Bro its the same design Im not buying it
Apple fans tHiS iS sO rEvOluTioNaRY tAkE aLL Of mY MoNey"
Soooooo basically nothing and fanboys sell their souls for it anyway
I personally feel like the reason the didnt give 128 as an option for the pro max was due to the device taking pictures and videos that need more space
is charger included
How long do you think itll be until Apple blacklist MKBHD for this less than 100 welcoming review
USBC change is belong to big technology Joke Since iPhone 1315 is no major technology break through hold them together almost you barely tell which one is 13 which 15 Change port  change color change frame then change price Apple is losing from its competitors Open eyes Look world
Im not looking to get a new phone for a few years I have a 13 Mini but Im liking what Im seeing with the incremental upgrades
Yup not impressed and so how much spying can they do on you 
Seems like quite the upgrade for me and my wife coming from the 12 pro and 11 pro
"Oh man iPhones can finally charge other devices over usb

Welcome to the future Apple fans Weve been here a while Lemme show you around Heres something we call fast charging Youll get it in a few years"
Assassin creed mirage on iPhone wth man what happened to apple marketing team
Mentioning USB 2 in 2023 is a disgrace no matter how you look at it
Next time talk about the high radiation  in this phone Because some countries like Italy banned the phone
I have 12 pro gold model It is disappointing that there was no gold colour model for 15 pro
The iPhone is now able to do something that other phones have been able to do since 2015 
"Apple is so lame Theu give u usb c but worse than what u get on androide The phone isnt inovative it repacked from last year I dont understand why ppl still buy apple When i see around here is that old ppl usualy use Apple so in a way Apple is the new Doro hahaha Everytime i hope for something fresh but no apple is always late to the game and calling it Gold and inovative and that they do it best but in reality no They are late to the game  very restricted and never give the user what they realy wants When they implement something new its 2 year old harware from the competition Lol

I still live in the hope i liked apple once and i want to like it agein but i dont see it today"
I like the RDJ beard look 
dont understand why iphone dont have 480 or 960 fps slow mo
"I cant stand USBC Im capable of owning more than 1 cord thank you I mean I actually have a Phillips and a straight blade screwdriver Thanks EU for forcing your crap on the rest of us And could someone please just build a quality smart phone without the intuitive crap that you cant shut off You know a phone for adults I really dont need 20 more useless features on an already overpriced toy 
Apple still calls it an IPhone But they have turned it into everything but a quality phone It kinda reminds me of the Samsung phone that I hated more than a dull pair of toenail clippers And dont even get me started on there version of the worst watch ever made It does everything but tell me the time when I just need to know the time I need to go now and accidentally butt dial someone because I simply picked up my phone and put it on my pocket 
DUCK of EU
And get off my lawn"
they had so little to indroduce thi syear that they had to fill half the event with boring environmental shit that no one cares about i was genuinely so hyped for this years iphone but after the reveal i was very dissapointed first time in like 6 years that i wont be unpgrading year on year
I want to upgrade my ip11pro max to ip15promax but i am still thinking about it because samsung z flip 5 is too cute too 
Ive had my XMax since it came out back in 2018 Its still pretty good except the battery is at 79 cap Im thinking of upgrading to the 15ProMax since now I take photosvideos of my diecast collection I invite you to visit my page 
welp i guess im gonna rock out on my 14 pro for this year 15 was underwhelming imho the 15 feels like a halfway done 14 pro and the 15 pro max has literally has every feature even the smallest ones id like to see what they bring to the the table next year definitely interested to see what the SE is gonna look like
If the headline feature is USBC theres not really much going on this year
Upgrading from a iPhone X definitely getting it
Samsung flip 5 more interesting than this
gen z mfs gon but a 15 pro just to be able to insta launch tiktok using the action button lmfao
I hope the action button comes to iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus
"Wow USBC and your pictures can be made into portrait photos after taking a picture 

Wow Such improvement much new  "
Its hard to believe and keeps getting harder and harder
booooooring
Apple give Euro usbc but hold on to the fast charging as revenge 
"Do you have an iPhone charger
No I do have an Android charger
Thatll work thanks"
Slow usb c at that lol Not interested in the slightest Im gonna keep my 13 pro max for now and foreseeable future Until the iPhone actually gets a real update Ive actually heavily been considering changing to android Im just tired of the same same same same bullshit with iPhones First time in 13 years Ive considered buying android actually
NAHH SON am good
Sounds like I can wait another year to upgrade mine
Danke an die EU dass die IPhones mit USBC kommen
Love to see new iphones launching every year your review videos and also love to see those things which I cannot buy Im still stuck at ip11 rn
"So there is nothing new other than usbc and chip in pro  
Apples are scammers big 
Aint hate the hussle tho"
The next one is going to fold like Samsung They know theyre missing out on the start of the foldable market They will copycat like they always do
marquesbrownlee iphone 15 60hz refresh or 90 
So if you dont upgrade to a iPhone 15 in the next few years you better not lose your charger Because theyre going to stop making them and they will charge 150 dollars for one
My Note 10 plus that Ive been using for over four years now has the usbc fast charging so that seems weird they dont have that in there
You got to make this videos shorter buddy
Nothing Special
Whats the expandable storage like on those iphones
Thank you for bringing back USB C for everyone EU
So theyre finally making them useful outside in the sunlight  It only took a decade to increase the screen brightness to common sense levels
Does anyone actually care about the camera Theyve been so good for years what does it matter Maybe 1 in 10000 will actually use this thing to shoot a video longer than 3 minutes BUILD A PHONE I CAN CARRY WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT BREAKING
USBC conversation over Im coming from an iPhone 11 I am due for an upgrade
Does the regular Iphone 15 has now 2x in starndard Photo mode Since its 48mpx now I guess they added that feature
I am seeing this video on my phone without nodge perfect Ho it is not an iPhone 
There are only 2 things Ive cared about or wanted for the iPhone since I began using oneAnd they did not get addressed Siri and the ability to use the phone without a case Lets face itSiri sucks Always has They know it we know it they seem to be oblivious to fact that the Google search engine and ecosystem are astronomically better and yet REFUSE to even consider addressing itthe world continues to show their support for Apple Apple doesnt care IT IS SO VERY SAD And we pay a grand for these devices Over and over we financially back Apple Buy on credit over years Still cant carry this device without a case Why We all know they can do it but they dont care about us the consumer Come on Apple your turn to show some love
Thoughts on if upgrading to a 15 pro max from a 13 pro max is worth it
Apple is like our governmentthey charge more for less and see how long they can get away with it Im good Ill stick with the iPhone 12 and keep the cash in my pocket god knows we all could use the extra cash over the same phone we already have in our pocket
If youre not rich it seems like skipping 12 releases seem to be the right move Maybe next Gen 1616pro will have a bigger more substanial update
Feeling for you 13 mins of struggling to find anything of any real value to the average user
This guy is a apple lover everything bout apple is good but not android so boring
Not just USBC a USD20 USBC  what an innovation product
Honestly Im excited about USB type C for one reason I dont have to explain to apple people what a type C charger is  theyre like oh uhm like the new android charger Or idk what that is while theyre literally charging theyre Mac book with it
Unbelievable
Why do Apple put the buttons on the wrong side of the phone
i literally watching samsung ad on this video
that wanker charger should do the best job to powered that iPhone 15 Pro Max
I have a 13 pro been acting up for the past month and Verizon kept trying to get me to upgrade to a 14 I like my iPhone but when you said the new phone has the new chip so future proofing Im like how long into the future 6 months
"Id argue that the usb c is not the major upgrade the 3nm processor is a huge upgrade camera system also huge yes pro max gets the biggest upgrade but come on titanium body thats not sneaky weight is the biggest draw back for the pro lineup and having lighter titanium body is definitely a huge upgrade huge 
I agree that the usb 30 was mentioned strangely and not saying anything about charging speeds is also so very much Apple thing but I dont think that usb c is the biggest
The question remains does this mean that the rulers of iPhone 16 is going to have bigger changes stand"
Finally going to upgrade from my XS Max to 15 Pro Max
Come on Apple Ive always been an applefan but have to admit Samsung are more advanced apple doesnt even have a flip phone yet 
"S far yur the only YouTuber in my subscriptions thats being realistic about this
Th thrs feel like theyre still in the hype of getting invited to the event and blowing things out of proportion without even realising it"
Phone is garbage
Most of what I want from this is an iOS upgrade Hardware changes arent enough to get me to upgrade and I usually do every year Not this year
So no difference from last year or the years before that Are people really going to bother with this glorified rerelease
Not just USBC rrrrrrright D
I miss when Marcus wasnt easily payed af to promote a product and wasnt biased
"What can Appel bring thats new
Nothing absolutely nothing but they can pretend that they invented USBC"
"Bro Gift me an Iphone 15 Pro 
Love you "
These phones are literally cringe
Peace
what refresh rate does the 15  15 plus have 
Basic science Titanium has less tensile strength than steel it just has a greater degree less weight hence having higher strength to weight Replacing a steel part with an equivalent or thinner titanium part always makes the part weaker
I had the 12 pro max for a couple years decided to upgrade with the 14 and it made absolutely no difference for me I will probably not upgrade again until OS updates are deprecated for that device like how I do with my Macs
Owner of an iphone 12 mini Would have loved to upgrade and it really seems iphone 15 is a great combo but just dont wanna leave the mini format I am sure I am not the only one A bummer they did not consider reintroducing a mini format
iphones are geared to a specific set of people You cant really compare the iPhone with Samsung or Xiaomi or any android really Apple is in a class of its own The day you will see the true difference is when phone operating systems become linux distros 
new regulation in EU forced them to switch to USBC not willingness to do something for you dude 
Will they ever get fast charge or will this phone have it
Im at a fork in the road rn I was android my whole life then in 2019 I said what the heck and switched to the iPhone 11 Pro Max I genuinely like the phone but now Im debating on upgrading to 15 or going back to android Idek what I would switch to if I went back
Apple just OBEY the EU LAW decision They didnt realese nothing
Excited to get the new iPhone 16 after watching this video No not the 15 the 16 
The action button Is pretty stupid IMO
So nothing special as per usual
who cares honestly boring
As someone who repairs phones for work that new back glass is the thing im most hype about lol
I dont think the new Iphone gives value for money my opinion though
iPhone An expensive way to watch YouTube
Used to be Apple users for over 10 years but switched to Huawei P60 Pro this year Compare iPhone 15 pro and Huawei new mate 60 Pro Apple lost completely no satellite call no 10 level aperture change lens only one 4800W lens no electronic antishake no 12G ram no 5000mAh battery no 88W wire 50W wireless charge more expensive even on 128G version et al
Looks like the Pro Max will sell out immediately and be in short supply for a while The pro will be easier to get for those willing to settle  Friday is going to be messy as people try and get those preorders in
Congratulations to iPhone to have officially become the most boring phone maker on the planet and possibly in the galaxy I cant believe anyone can still justify buying these same old same old phones
I have been waiting for usbc charging so time to get one
I think every 3 generations is good enough for a change
Thx 
Ight my iphoneX may finally be upgraded The cameras age really showed on my trip to europe this summer I ended up having my family retake most of my photos on their phones and send them to me at first and eventually just had them take them all and send them to me Its worth waiting for usbc if imma have it another 5 years xD
Youve become such an Apple shill its unbearable
I love it how you talk with no BS about the iPhone straight up how it is Not everybody realizes that the new iPhone isnt even that big of a deal
EU is biggest innovators this year
I am still using IPhone 6s that I got in 2018 It is still functioning well unless I have to charge it two to three times a day compared to the new release that can serve a day on one charge
Coming from the 14 pro max and may not upgrade this time
its the same shit lol People are sheeps
The iPhone 12 is the strongest iPhone they ever made The glass is strong Outstanding water proof
Its the same phone with a new port
I watch this and regardless of what you say it still feels like the same old iPhone like it has been for years Nothing is revolutionary nothing screams buy me its boring as alwaysthen you see things like z fold 5 That is exactly the opposite of this
How big are you hands Cuz the big iPhone with a case waaayy too big for me to use daily
You are getting ripped off with this 15 model as you only get 60HZ refresh rate when you pay 800 dollars You can buy a 400 dollar android phone with 120HZ and better charging capabilities Apple has been playing its customers for chumps for years with each so called new iteration Be real and stick with Samsung Galaxy phones The TRUE winner
Wallpaper link from yhe thumbnail please
I have said it before I charge all my devices at night I need a cable for each
"I am ready for a new phone I still have the 11 pro I am
Excited"
Iphone 15 has 60hz desplay doesnt it
Giveaway to audiance this 15
"615

Real simple This is still Apple were talking about  they CAN give it thunderbolt 3 speeds but why would they Just another excuses to buy the next iPhone 16 17 18 and so on They will milk this Apple cow until it dies"
Why are we still upgradingreaching the end
Jetzt kann ich mir das IPhone 14 Pro ja langsam zum Weinachten zum Spotpreis bestellen
So another year and nothing new again Apple always seems a little behind these days Whats going on The really need to step it up
Im remembering every detail but cant afford it
I wanna see if the 15Pro Max camera is worth itI REALLY wanna get those amazing Moon shots my Galaxy S23 friends get
Zzzzz simple rinky dink upgrades Not worth it if you have the 14 propro max Thats why if ur gonna upgrade wait once every 3 generations So if youre holding a 14 pro wait till the 17 propro max
This feels like a very boring release
New portrait updates Android phones has that for the past 5 years
Im going to have my action button make my phone go into silent mode Kinda like the old switch did But instead of seeing red Ill get to pick up the phone and look at the screen This is going to be awesome
 wow
104 The One Piece is real
And for 2024 fast charging ding ding ding ding
With this being my first official iPhone im stumped on whether to get small iPhone or the bigger iPhone Any suggestions
Lowkey gonna need a jailbreak the app library gives me a headache
If you need to clarify that its more than just USBC implying that USBC is the main difference Im done with Apple based on the title alone
I dont think those who have iPhone 14 pro or max should get the 15s its slight update not upgrade
Nothing new Its copy  paste from year to year so they make enough one model to cover 10 years ahead in selling and every year they come to us with the same nonsense Nothing new that deserves to spend 10001300USD and in some other countries 2000  3000 plus to just like oh look at me I have the iPhone 121314 upgraded to Titanium  an Android charging port thats ridiculous Its an I phone 12 with miner update as 13  14 No more  for me
Can you try rigging out an iPhone 15 Pro Max as a workhorse camera with a MagSafe fan and USBC external SSD and battery for long continuous recording
Typical apple crap
If you want to support right to repair and actual innovation check out Fairphone 5 Dutchmade replaceable battery USBC 30 all the making of a modern smartphone  actual sustainable manufacturing process
I cant believe you mentioned future proofing in an Apple review 
You didnt talk about the ability to record movie directly to an external SSD Is that only for the por max version
Really not too impressed with these phones
Thank god its not a folding phone
"Nothing new
Same phone every year"
SHOULDVE MADE A FINGERPRINT SENSOR ALONG WITH THE ACTION BUTTON
Not hating I love this guy but what do you reckon it would cost to sponsor his first video about the new iPhone I mean its the goto right after the Apple event an he has already mind blowing numbers in everyday videos  I go with 50k minimum 
456 They showed full AAA games running on a phone and you barely glossed over it lol You talk more about the USB speeds than you did about this
I wish they put a Led on the Action Button that light red or green to know if your phone is silent or not like the old switch
Was hoping for more Yawn
1000 for an iphone in 2023 is so insane to me I would personally never buy it especially now when you can get solid android for 300 or less but I guess its a prestige thing
looks good
Its a iPhone same as the last 5 just with an android charger 
The action button is way out of reachPerhaps swapping volume button with action button make sense May be iPhone 1617 they will swap it with the volume button
I have an 11 Pro Max so I will definitely be getting one of the new pro max phone Ill be waiting a couple months though Im in no rush but Im super excited
Well Ive been waiting to upgrade my phone simply for USBC ALL my other devices are USBC so will be nice to go to 1 cord
Ive had a broken 12 mini for several years and each time I think about upgrading I think oh the next one isnt far out and maybe they will switch out the stupid port finally Since literally every other device I have from them and most other companies is USBC including theirs just not on the phone end
Nothing special for majority of day to day users
SORRY apple fanboys but SAMSUNGANDROID have it for years and much better IPHONE 15s is just a copy paste from last years iPhones SAD BUT TRUE
I still have my iPhone 12 Pro Max so Im definitely upgrading this year lol
"Ive been an Apple victim for 14 years Ive currently got a 13 pro 512gb 
Ive become increasingly tired of being treated like a fool by Apple Their latest dirty trick of using software to throttle the data and charging speeds of the new USBC port if youre not using Apple cable etc has helped me decide I wont be buying an IPhone again
HUAWEI for me next time"
The fact Apple tried to fight the USBC regulation is hilarious
so lucky I switched to samsung s23 ultra as a 10 years apple users with full apple ecosystem since ip5 i do not see any future with apple anymore they called the new features like usb c action button 48 megapixel camera 5x optical zoom and so on as new GAME CHANGER while other androids phones had the features from many years back how funny was that
"Nah Ill pass
IPhone 14Pro"
All these techchanels fishing in the same pond for likes subscribers advertisement and money And all over a phone that does exactly the same as the iPhone 7 8 X XS XR 11 11 PRO 12 12 mini 13 13 mini and the 14 Apple and Wonderlust is an insult to humans
no reason to upgrade if you have iPhone 11 for Pro graphic designers it may worth it to upgrade to the 12 pro for that one 3D sensor
Good review but no discussion on the battery  life
USB type C REVOLUTIONARYYYY APPLES ALWAYS INNOVATING Thatll be 1500 please 
think Ill keep my 12 pro max for another year
In a few words  nothing really new to see here 
The Guy who hated Bixby botton no LOVES Apple action botton
I stopped buying new iPhones at the X and even went back to the 8 plus They never get any better they just add a new processor that the human brain cant even notice any changes and an extra camera lens Waste of money
The new phone has hardware ray tracing upscaling and monitor out  Yes its a PlayStation  Think on that well as much as the Android folks who haunt these halls can
LOLnow iphone users have to buy type C charger luckily my secondary phone is a android
899 must be nice 256gb pro max 2199aud  Base model 128gb 1499
For some reason MKBHD can somehow stretch out a new iPhone review that essentially hasnt changed barely 1 from last years model and make it seem like its a totally groundbreaking launch
Same old BS since iPhone 11
Still a Apple fanboy
Why do people give their money to Apple for inferior products These people are insane
Wow Amazing
the pink one is a vibe
13P is more than enough for me now but I will look into next 16P more closely
In the era of wireless the Apple brings us to the rock age  with the cable power share  D
I think that now you only really notice an upgrade when you have missed a few generations My current phone is iPhone X and Im going to upgrade this year and should see a huge leap forward in terms of features
When USBC is the headlinging feature on the new iPhoneHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Samsung already has add portrait effect to every photo they just never advertised it apple just copy and show off so people think that these are some new features which they are not just like what they did with cinematic video which android has been doing potrait videos way before now coming to camera apple following androids leed   and  launching telephoto lens which should have been done years sooner  android has been doing everything just never advertised every little feature they have But i guess its understandable as apple doesnt offer a lot of features
Camp totally dont care
I get my phones based on their series number I had the 7 now 13 and my next one will be 18 Because these are my lucky numbers
I am a youtuberMere Pinky ka challenge hai Mere challenge se aapko help ho sakti hai 
Pretty much samsung bixby button
I am a youtuber Mere Pinky ka challenge hai Mere challenge se aapko fayda ho sakti hai 
I am a youtuber  Mere Pinky ka challenge hai Mere challenge se aapko help ho sakti hai 
whats the wallpaper link tho
Lame and boring Stopped halfway
Congratulations Apple fan boys for finally getting 20k INR basic charging port for some 1018 Lkh INR apple is going to take from you
I am a youtuber Mere Pinky ka challenge hai Mere challenge se aapko help ho sakti hai
look at me i do fly business class
No need to buy if those using 15 pro  No reason to upgradeonly baloon words
Gotta charge ur phone w them 120 watt MacBook chargers
More should be made about the power of the EU Including the nudge to self repair
 I am a youtuberMera Pinky ka challenge hai Mere challenge se aapki help ho sakta hai
Still its comes with only 60hz refresh rate
sadly it is usb C with usb 20 speed wtf apple
News flash Apple have been stagnant for years and nothing is new Its boring
Not really impressed enough with the upgrades to want to replace my 14 pro max The usbc is a welcomed edition but like you said no fast charging so yeah I will pass until next year
i have 400 limit
Shot on RED camera 
Intro USB this year so everyone will buy it then next year intro Rapid charging because of the USB c so everyone will have to upgrade typical apple
1215ai
"Does it have touch ID
They should bring it back in my opinion"
Hmm lets pay more for an inferior product and then try and justify it Thats the actual definition of stupid If they looked up stupid in the dictionary it would be apple buyers
This iPhone it big difference So I have iPhone 14 pro max  and it works to try to change for this iPhone 15 pro max
As the worlds number one technology self media it is absurd to say that the 15 series uses a 14 Pro main lens sensor and the 15 Pro series uses a larger new main lens sensor you really dont deserve such a subscription volume Its obvious that 15 Pro series still uses IMX 803 as the same of 14 Pro
Interesting to see how  turn being forced into USB c by the  into a win 
Perfect sponsor
The button should be mapped to multiple things with different length presses
76 million views for a review
Nothing exciting going to wait till next year
Weight savings of titanium on the Pro might be a deal maker for me  Ive had a 12 Pro since it came out and its weight has always been an annoyance  Lighter weight on top of being a pretty big upgrade from the 12 Pro might get me to switch
"Im usually not a big apple  iPhone fan however I like photography and i gotta say that i like the feature of being able to have 242835 mm options since those are pretty standard focal lengths I think that 24mm being so wide is part of what makes average phone photography worse because a lot of people point and shoot with this very wide angle which usually includes way more than needed in their shot making photos messy due to bad compositions 

If i had one Id probably default to 35 or 28mm and switch to 24 mostly for landscapes and such"
You talking about the camera talked about the new Chip one thing you forgot to mention which I thought will be very important is that is the phone is the reception any better does it cut out all the time can you use it on the ground in a tunnel is the phone
I HATE USB C seroius they are going to get damaged
"Great overview Im definitely interested in the new iPhones especially the Pro models The new titanium design looks really sleek The alwayson display that only the Pros get will be nice too
USBC is way overdue but Im bummed the regular 15 is stuck with USB 2 speeds Seems kind of lame to not go all in with something weve had on Android for years
The new 48MP camera sounds awesome Should mean way more detail when you zoom in Hope youll test that out in your full review
Not sure the action button is something Id use much but its cool theyre trying new things Definitely better than losing the mute switch
Overall seems like a solid upgrade especially for the Pro models Battery life is always my main concern so looking forward to seeing your test results on that Preordered the 15 Pro Max Cant wait to try it out"
Wife and I have a XR maybe time to upgrade 
"Except the inevitable switch to USBC this year feels like a bummer As boring as the 12 release back then
Will skip another year and will wait for value gains withe the 16Pro coming from a 13 Pro User"
You must own apple stock
My S20 Plus has USB C 32 20GBPS just saying
I cant wait to see your review of the Huawei Mate 60 Pro
Great summary However Ill be sticking with my 14 Plus till it falls apart
Impresively dominator flip Z by octa prosc do not recharge income fast this Iphone 15
My 13 mini battery life is horrible so its charging rn
as an android user im now bummed our chargers will get borrowed at work and home 
Titanium has helped reduce the weight by 20gams 
Where can we get the mountain background in the thumbnail
I dont know specifically where but your videos have recently gone up another level again
It can play ps4 games Im definitely switching from android to iphone FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME
Its just sad how these big companies always limit new features like the USB 30 speeds so they can artificially give the pro models a feature that the regular models dont and then they eventually add it to the regular models to be able to say see were doing improvements Yea an improvement that could have easily been in the regular models years ago
it is the same iphone as usual just a few more features
I have the 14 Pro and I would have upgraded to the 15 pro if it also had the 5x camera I dont want the max its to big for me but I would love a better telephoto cam on my phone
So there is nothing new
No fast charging apple be playing with yall n yall keep going back
Paid one I think
Congrats iPhone users you can now use my S23 charger
Mad they didnt introduce the 2tb pro max mad
Samsung been had the switch option  as usual Apple is always copying
 so Europe won we made you implement usb type c Good 
You missed the most important new feature 3D camera
Wow its a new camera
It is just USBC literally
Can someone confirm how much is the RAM for the pro models please
        200  
Iphone 15 is targeted for iphone 12 and older users if you have the recent ones like the 14  13 of course not much has changed
"Just an expensive gadget for rich folks or those who want to think they are rich and show off to others
Android phones are superior in abilities in every way
Just a phone to impress those who are impressed with showy bling bling stuff  like shallow gold digger women period"
Ill keep my 14PM Im good This update is ehhh usb c a button 5x zoom instead of 3 Like I said ehhh No fast charging no under glass fingerprint scanner bland colors higher pricenah  Have fun though
"wow finally iphone is getting a bit more customizable just like an android

glazing on iphone at 60 fps lol"
Thanks for the review A Definite No for me with the 15s its not worth the  over here
Basically removed the silent button and reintroduce the camera button p
Im finally updating my iPhone xs to this
Not just USBC but mainly just USBC
Refresh rate
Android 
618 Because fast charging is the breakthrough upgrade on the iPhone 17
Finally  I can charge my phone in my apple friend house
"The only new thing in iPhone 15
Titanium body
And type c port
"
I dont really get the excitment for the action button there is an accessibility feature to doubletap on the back of the iPhone which does the same thing since years
Dam 7 million views in one day
Thank you for the video I thinking about upgrading to improve my ambience videos quality Im ao curious about the spacial video
The only edition to the form factor to iPhones is a customisable button
Quick question if the new AirPods only difference is the type c connector am I able to just go switch the cases out or do I have to pay the price for whole new AirPods cuz it will be annoying having to use 2 different chargers for my phone and my airpods
Looking forward to new audio gear like mics and interfaces
One piece glass back
Technology is a Trojan horse
Still deciding
60 hz on iphone 15
Still using 12 Pro Max No nned to upgrade  Thanks for the video 
iPhone 1515 Pro Impressions Not Just USBC but also Ill get paid by Mr Tim Cook soon or later
Why u have usbc but it doesnt support super fast charging I was hoping for that Bummer
What is that dark blue iphone at 053 I havent seen a dark blue colorway on notpro models this year Im confused
big daddy EU
New tweaks on iPhone 15 pro max not worth an upgrade from my iPhone 14 pro max
"my favorite feature is how they were forced to add USBc and crippled it on purpose to USB2 speeds speeds released in 2000 on a 800 or whatever smartphone
at this point they are just ripping off they customers  and yes I do own a 14 pro max

Apple  does less costs more"
Wonder how much of this is the EUs ruling on USB C or just Apple coming to the acceptance that it is a superior port like they did with the pro iPads
Why do people go crazy about any feature introduced to iphones when literally the same feature had been introduced to other smartphones ages ago I have this customizable button that opens an app or whatever on my s10 which was released in 2019 apple introduces that 100 years later and everybody is shocked
skip to 245 if you dont want to hear anything about the typec and how good that is we all know apple was lacking on that
Its really great to know how good the iPhone 15 is I will always know apple as the best smartphone manufacturer
I dont see any change at all  we all know type C story 
"if your using the iphone 13 all i can say dont buy this phone
its the same thing"
Of course they arent going to give you the benefits of usb c when theyre being forced to use it Thats the rub Lol
Notes titanium is significantly stronger than the most commonly used steel grades But the strongest known alloy steels are stronger in the strongest temper than the strongest titanium alloys in the hardest state
"Im pretty sure that with the iOS 18 they will add the ability to map the action button for one click double click and press and hold
And maybe the iPhone 1617 will have it also"
Can anyone get my one of the pro max
iphone 15 basic still uses 60 hrtz
You sound like a fanboy
I cant wait to read emails on that
1st iPhone 4 then iPhone 11 now I will buy iPhone 15
Yes amazing same design since iphone 11 shit changes again does not feel like a worth upgrade to 13 just like 14 did cameras are so good on 13 pro there is no point
Another virtually pointless update from Apple
oH sO eXiTinG aNd InOvAtiVe
This guy is amazing He held a red komodo while recording this 
Right now I could only recommend Iphone 15 for people who want to get an iphone Im a Samsung user
Lol you know its a useless phone when it has this kind of header Smh They have run out of ideas for 5 years now
Absolutely nothing has improved then Its just slightly different If they made an iPhone 15 mini I would be interested just duee to the form factor No reason whatsoever to go Apple Hello Android And by the way ANY digital camera with a 1 sensor or bigger laughs ANY phone in the face regarding image quality Phones are so far behind its scary that people think a phone takes as good photos Paying a premium for a phone camera is just insane Get a decent phone and a real camera and be marveled by the image quality No need to fake depth of field No need to zoom digitally etc
One cable to charge them all
Use the action button for Tesla shortcuts to either unlock the car or start the climate  which makes the phone feel like a key fob
I wonder if the 15 could do fast charging with a firmware update
"Two features of phone are extremely important

1 Display
2 Network reception

If possible have a separate video for these rankings phones as per these two qualities"
Meh 
VIDEO SUMMARY IPhone 14 with usb c 
I mean their strategy is kind of a bummeryou have to buy the pro model first day to have a prober use of your extra spended money if you buy just a half year after release you already know that u will get the same tech and even better features with the normal iphone in half year they should at least give the last years pro ther same features then
RIP Android
Radiation  isue and brain cancer dont buy apple buy any thing else BE AWARE zombie
Awaiting your Review
Android user so Apple does NOTHING for how much now
Such a fall in tech industry is so sad from keypad phones to touch and then heavy advancement in every generation so fast it came to celebrating of a usb port Never thought this day will come 5 years ago Such a Disappointment
too many features and battery all over the day now 15 series going on our expectations for at least 15 days battery capacity Mr cook and his colleagues expressed the terms  features go next level  making people fool standing on apple campus and  start blah blah blaaaaaaaaaaaa
USBC will be able to charge your phone much faster but prepare for battery health to decline more rapidly
Fanboy here but jeez totally underwhelming move by Apple Come on guys where has the innovation gone  I can see this setting back the company and losing even more ground to you know who A huge disappointment and missed opportunity
I know its supposed to be exciting for Apple users but gosh damn this is so boring
"Basically the only upgrade is the USBC which they were forced to do by law
Also next year or the year after that the upgrade will be a removable battery since European law will demand it by 2025

So Apple is no longer innovating They are just doing stuff the governments want"
But can you play Fortnite on it no
As an Android user Im just laughing  This is so sad
No battery update
No 15 MiniBoo
"Here in the UK the trade in offers and finance deals offered by apple are actually very good 
I can see a lot of people upgrading fearing that their old iphone with lightning will drop in value and as time goes by battery capacity drops so does the trade in value i think this usbc switch is pretty significant and the salescycle that has been engineered by apple is becoming more and more affordable if you are already a iphone user 
I also think the major networks and old fashioned way we have been sold phones tied to networks will die soon its a good deal to get financing straight from apple and stick your own rolling monthly sim card in So if signal is poor you can ditch and switch I know the esim models are probably coming soon what will that mean for moving between networks will it come to the uk Are we going to be getting ripped off again For instance most networks here in the uk increase your monthly charge every year in line with inflation  34 on the phone and the sim so you end up paying another 1015 a month by the end Apple have slowly been eating at the networks share of market good for them"
Idk bro im a 13 mini or just buy an android kinda guy
Cheers to EU regulation
Hahaha haha type c charger android rules 
I guess they settled
This is what Im talking about People like you help apple with the good marketing to sell their dumb stupid phones I mean only you can make a 13 minute video to explain basically nothing new except USB C and the titanium case Wow
The best thing is its Made in India 
cant wait to doomscroll all day on this new marvel of modern technology
You know hes good when hes featured in the Apple event 
Apple should be dead long back but for all the lobbying they do politically USB C Every one clapping for apple for this terrific invention
Im very annoyed with people complaining about products that arnt revolutionary when they release every year The iphone 15 is better than the iphone 14 which is the goal Majority of people keep the same phone model for multiple years meaning the new phone is multiple year better than the one they have Its just like cars they release each year with slight improvements that turn into huge improvements with multi year gaps
Talking about USB3 the only reason I found it useful is the direct to disk recording the 15 Pro is capable of To me it never made sense to record ProRes on a phone but even less if you can only record locally This option to directly record over an external SSD made the whole thing interesting
I dont understand why people still buy iPhones Its the same phone every year nothing new
Was looking for some software updates like  activating iMessage for only one of the simcards or switching automatically on and off the pro sim I guess its not in the agenda 
800900 for a phone with 60Hz screen 60Hz in 2023 when budget Android phones costing as low as 200 have 90Hz LOL thx but no thx
i honestly just want a phone where the camera isnt literally twice as thick as the phone itself
 disappointed lighting port is not there 
Im glad to hear that they managed to close the gap to the rest of the industry
oh goooooood dont u know that they were forcefully changing the usb c charging bcuz of the EU regulations to make al charger same and simple
waiting for jerryrigeverythings durability test on the titanium
one question is this iphone 15  pro max getting hot when playing games
I dont usually buy the newest iPhone but I still have an XR so time to demote this and get something newer lol
Lemme grab a popcorn and again listen to things I cant afford 
Lightning connector is more durable structure design Why not making it usb3 protocol in lightning con structure Best of both words
I havent upgraded since iPhone 8 I am getting the 15 Pro this year I feel like the difference is gonna be huge
I stay with my 11 Pro Max
Whats that Wallpaper
Apple just be selling people features that a 5 yr old 400 android phone has
Id rather save my money for next years iPhone 16
Omg the camera lens is sooooo bulky 
iPhone 1515 Pro just boomm
I bought a 14 pro a couple of monts ago but dont regret that after watching this
the only thing i can praise apple for is how they keep implementing such underwhelming new features and look changes and still sell their phones like hotcakes at a premium
Who cant afford like me
as much as i didnt feel like the new iphones got so much of an upgrade for the average user i cannot but thank apple for the minor changes and the major ones most wouldnt see
I have just heard a bunch of nothing new
You know what I would pay a Pro Max price for a Pro but it hasnt the same features It was always like that Same with the mini models They always had shitty hardware like display camera and most the important aspect battery and Apple is so surprised about the bad selling numbers I think my next phone will be a zenfone They just have to improve the camera a little bit more I think Asus seems to be the only company which understood that there people who want Pro features in a small size
Apple is really playing with people what kind of a Nonsense is this
They are going to throttle all our older models for this bullshitHow can they call this a new model Goddamn the future is stupid
Marques the money lover
that usbc is game changer revolutioner like anything before
They should call it UsbCphone Pro
614  are you really surprised why they didnt include fast charging Do you not expect that to be the main selling point next year
video is unnecessarily long 5 minutes was enough
"Looks d same as my 11
Im good"
I have an iPhone 8 for work USBC is literally the only thing I care about Ive waited this long
Hey Folks Apple will give you fast charging after probably 2 years and its only comes for Pro its really not about they cant but why would they  They customers are loyal  i dont why so many people are at Apple store its the same phone as in your pocket what changed its like you never saw USBC anyway i am android user i dont have to say anything you guys are free to be trolled by Apple
Is there any info on if they have MFIed the cables Will the phones charge with the same speed out of a Thinkpad charger than they will via the holy supplied Apple cable
I yawned 10 times over hearing ahout the new features
"I dont know if you know this or that its relevant for that matter But Apple owns USBC
I thought I would just mention that bye"
im from tiktok 
Surprisingly theres not much of a difference between 14 Pro and 15 Pro surprisingly If my carrier lets me upgrade for free Ill do it but Im not actively trying to get this iPhone like I did with the 14 Pro when I had the 12
both the new iPhone 15 Pros are good but the iPhone 14 Pro Max just works well for me and I  think the hassle of buying and migrating stuff to the 15s aint worth it if youre like me who doesnt take much photos and videos let alone any pro res which means I also dont need USB3 speeds though the usb c is convenient because only my iphone uses a lightning cable play games on mobile I think this upgrade would be best for those still using the X XS and 11 series phones andor those who would like to play AAA games on mobile if the new lenses are important for you in using your iphone to take a lot of photos
"Not apple using 60Hz in 2023 

I would love to see a comparison BTW the 15 pro max and 23 ultra "
If loading time of AAA games will be lesser its totally worth it
where is the mini version
I have 14 pro max will prob wait for iphone 16
I was smasung flag ship for years s8 all the way to s21 ultra Now switched to the pixel 7 pro and absolute love the google phone i will not be going to iphone any time soon
I got my Iphone 14 Pro Max last year by March  so im on my journey to wait few more years until a new upgrade cause Iphone 14 Pro Max IS a beast
I mean  the USB C was just implemented because Europe forced them to
355 you best believe the software department developed that 5 years ago then the marketing department said we can use that to promote the 15 in 5 years lets shelve that feature Apple is so gross Makes me feel bad for Steve His legacy of middle finger to everyone but the customer is LONG gone
cool I ll wait for the iphonepro18
Lets all be honest here its the same damn thing as the previous iPhones nothing big nothing life changing just an iPhone
Im still using the iPhone X atm so Im really looking forward to upgrading to iPhone 15 Pro soon
Apple is fucking with us Indians Theyve increased prices for both pro and pro max in India Bummer Im anyway not gonna upgrade from my 14 pro since theres hardly any significant changes worth upgrading
Just buy iphone 15 and samsung 14 Prob solved
Dull as always Id never buy any of those
USB C is being mandated soon in the EU so Apple isnt being generous other than implementing ahead of time Colours to me are irrelevant considering I use a case
"iPhone in 2008 Hey look at me  I have no buttons

iPhone in 2023 Look at me I have Button it is revolutionary "
Dont care at all
We need a deep analysis on that 5x telephoto and the different focal lengths
"getting rid of the 1100 phone
Oh dont worry we have to pay 1200 Euros for the Pro here which is 1300 Starting to feel like I should just take a trip to the US to buy a phone "
So again  you were plummeting Pixel 6a in your video so much for daring to have ONLY 60 Hz a phone for 450 USD but you still wont admin Apple just spits on its customers for giving 60 Hz screen for on a phone that starts from 800 USD in 2023
My entire iPhone journey has been the 4S 6S SE 2nd Gen and now Im thinking I go 15 Pro Max next
Getting a samsung add on this video is so harmonic
So its basically last years iPhone with a type C charger Yeah Ill pass
Another iphone Yawn
Getting dragged on Tiktok regularly now Expect low sales They are funny videos too
Waiting for iPhone 200 ah
The action button is just a recycled Bixby key 
Apple  is just a software company No innovation always polishing 
The fact that you recorded this video spontaneously outdoors yet it still appears visually appealing and captivating truly astonishes me It reflects your exceptional content creation skills I thoroughly enjoyed it
I recall learning about Apples acquisition of a camera startup more than a decade ago This startup had pioneered depth measurement techniques for postpicture focus adjustment It appears that Apple has now integrated this technology into their products
"How can you still be hyped about a phone they are literally the same thing everytime  a PC yeah man can be lifechanging but the iphone 101112131415161718 are the fking same thing with tiny touches of better quality on camera or battery 
stop hyping for nothing"
Titanium is flammable  
To charge your friends Android phone No Itll be the other way around iPhone users will be relieved that now they can borrow their friends Android charger cause you know most Android phones these days lasted for the whole day or more even with heavy usage not like iPhone
not worth upgrading from 1414pro
Dam now these iPhone users going to ask to use my charger since its type C now lol
you and your apple lolx
AI artificial itelligence to capture ur data
This is the sad part about apple Android phones have had usb c ports for a while now Not only that but the cheap Chinese phones have up to 8 figs of ram and 256 of storage and not cost and arm and a leg The phones seem nice but the prices are just insane
Im on a 12 Im definitely getting one
we are at the point where iphone 14 pro looks more premium than 15 pro because of the sharp edges and the colors
The colours have to be a throwback to the 5C
I am perfectly happy with my 13 pro but I like where apple is going Probably going to switch in 2027 Xd
Im looking forward to the discovery in 6 months time that its not technically titanium 
In the camp of I jumped from 6 to 11 to 14 so Im gonna wait another couple of years to see what theyll do
Ill just stick with the 13
I hate to say it but clearly you can see apple holds back on technology How hard or how much more expensive is to put the same higher quality USBC on all of there iPhones How hard is it to put super fast charging something that Samsung has had for years Then apple fans have the guts to say iPhone or nothing 
Still got a 12 pro max and aint gonna change it Not worth it yet Its not like jumping from the AirPods that were available back there from the ones that are now It feels the same phone
Will the iphone support connection to an external ssd without external power
"It sounds like the 14 pro is the same phone then as the new 15 base model
Same processor and camera too"
Welcomed stuff  a nicer way of saying same shit different year
yaoyaolingxian
I have a Xiomi poco phone with NFC even if I never used NFC 128 GB of space since like 3 years ago and I still have available space playing games using every day with no problem I dont even think of buying another phone Buying an Iphone every year with only some small new things is ridiculous I dont want to get into the Iphone world yet
Definitely camp dont care at all Im not a pro max fan to begin with as I have the ROG phone for big phones but my iphone 13 mini is still going strong and there is zero need to upgrade here until the eventual iph13 usb 30 update
"So last years phone  usb c for the normal phones 
And last years phone  usb c  slightly better chip for the pro ones 
Doesnt get more apple than that "
I will keep my 14 pro max 
Can you call someone with it
"I work for Verizon sales campaign chat service  and on this launch we  handle 3 chat at a time due to high chat valume

We face many errors sometimes during order process in system and it takes time to respond all the customers in chat due to various reasons and three chats become 4 sometime and because of time wait time customers give us negative survey they dont know so its not their fault and impacts our perfomance

This time is also goint to be crazy I can not wait to place orders"
It sounds like the opposite of the future
If they changed their ios software to look more Glassy I would 100 switch back to iPhone but sadly the software doesnt look any different
it s funny to see how american are talking about this usbc as a big revolution for apple but actually they had no choice it s only because of a restriction in Europe They have not reinvented the wheel and there is no need to argue 1 thousand year about this new revolution  They just turned this into a marketing argument for people who dont read international news and it works
While watching this on an Xperia X compact take a look at the USBC port at the bottom
usb and still manage to fuck it all up
The  I  in iPhone stands for  idiots
So Im other words same shit different year I wont worry about it again apple is a let down might change to Samsung tbh
why dont unbox  huawei mate60pro
Still takes pictures in 43 by default Stupid Apple I blow everyones mind when I show them how to take pictures in 169
Pretty boring updates
So the same with just a usb lol
Is it worth going from 14plus to 15promax 
Im not trying to be a hater I wanted to like this but we do understand that my S21 can change regular photos to portrait I wanted to upgrade my 14 pro to the 15pro but this is the same damn phone I would STILL  give them Up to 500 but they said my 14 pro was worth 570 and I was done with Apple This is ridiculous I literally still shoot my videos on the S21 Ultra  which is what 2 years old because ITS A BETTER PHONE  I literally have both carry both I WANT to like the Iphone but the Samsung is objectively better and when you key feature you want to charge me 1000 for is SLOW usb C so next year you can put in thunderbolt which everyone had for years and beat me again for a 1000 no thank Apple Edit PS and I still would have maybe given them the G but the colors are AWFUL  I ahve the purple 14 Pro Ill hold what i got
"The amount of times i had a collegea come in and ask for an iphone charger cause they forget theirs is almost funny

And always nope sorry no iphones here all IT people who want to be able to change a setting

So for those people this is a blessing allthough they will never admit to it cause the apple connector was sooo much better Especially the quality if the oem cables these things fall apart when you get them out of the package

And the only reason they do it is cause they are forced to do it They cant force people to buy their overpriced cables and chargers anymore they didnt do it voluntarily"
iPhone 16 will be their Fast Charging Type C iPhone iPhone 17 will have Super Fast Charing iPhone 18 will have 45W Ultra Fast Charging
Why did you just skim over the whole GPU upgrade hardware accelerated raytracing metal upscaling That small things running a whole RE4 remake With ray tracing Smooth
Same phone different year
Same phone every year
Its nice that the launched the iphone 15 pro with the Pro chipset so that the next time if they launch the iphone 16 it can have the DUMED down version of the A17 Pro chip which will be Just A17 LOL nice move apple
Apples Notches are ATRCIOUS and INVASIVE Samsung just does this so much better and has brought real innovation in the last 10 years of Smartphones
"Wish the iPhone recorded in 50 fps There is a whole that ISNT fucking America out there 

Plus would be cool if you could make the actionable button rotation lock"
Ill keep my 12 Pro Max for now I made a promise to myself to only upgrade until they get rid of the dynamic island
Camp totally getting one of these
USB C letss goo
Stupid extra button Just add icon to Home Screen
Thanks to the EU for USB C
No mini version 
Getting old there Marques Preferring beige over matte black lol
For me USBC really is only nice to have for traveling I charge my iPhone via MagSafe 99 of the time anyways and I never plug it in for data transfer I could actually use a portless iPhone easily D
"Please tell me why Apple removed that logo intro now from their event on youtube
Is there any problem
I wanna see that intro again "
Next year they will add USB 4 and it will be revolutionary 
Yeah I couldnt belive it when they compared the transfer speed via the USBC to USB2 USB3 has been out for over 10 Years
Its not surprising AT ALL that they switched to USBC The European Union literally told them that they WOULD use USBC or they WOULD NOT be selling ANY phones there at all Do you take that kind of a hit to sale Probably not Plus it gives Apple a chance to make you have to buy all new accessories to work with USBC Free win for them
I will do Apple a favor by NOT ordering any iPhone 15 model from a huge fan of Apple that bought every model since 2006 to a man for the first time that will NOT order because Apple really stopped innovating not even trying gimmicks in their new iPhones
Is it just me or is it normal to just be generally happy when MKBHD posts a near iPhone video
I remember having my first USBC phone like a decade ago It took Apple just a millennium and its not even their decision say thanks to EU government
"I am currently on iPhone 13 Macbook Air M1 Airpods Pro 2 and Series 8 45mm and the only device I want to upgrade is Macbook Air to 15 M2 Air
TBH I am kind of disappointed that iPhones get such tiny upgrades in a span of 1 year this was not the case back when Steve Jobs was there
Also Apple Products are relatively expensive here in India due to high import duties"
Im getting the pro max because ios17 excludes my iPhone X  So in a way tonnes of of upgrades for me 
The contrast between his reaction to this and the S23U Is astonishing
Usb C doesnt change anything id just you crying all this time you know how many lighting cables we have to this day
Bro you forgot about that 3d Video making from pro max 
"These are TINY changes Barely needed an event Cloud have just emailed everyone Seriously these are the same phones as last year and the 4 years before that 

Dont waste your money Get an innovative device like  a Samsung Fold 5 Flip 5 Sony Xperia 5 or 1 best cameras on the market or any flagship Android Youll be getting a lot more for your money"
Who here is going to get the iPhone 15
Absolutely no body is talking about front camera
the Pro colors are boring
They just slapped a new port and a multifunction button and then call it I N N O V A T I V E Wake up people
Wonderless event That got me
So the new iPhone has nothing new
Getting a 15 pro max Still on an iphone XR and have never spoiled myself when it came to phones Going all in this time
Im not from my 13pro max until I see some real differences
when it comes to iPhones review seems biased  No much features on this new fone and the issues with displays of 13 were not mentioned at all
Samsung S23 is better
Since my mom uses a nokia  coz she drops the phone 45 times a day I would be happy if they release an iron iphone 
Another year another iPhone and I have not saved up enough money as always The iPhone X lives another year
They had to switch to USBC otherwise they would not be able to sell in Europe
Yea not convinced im good with my 13 pro
Previously apple didnt enable the data transfer with windows machines With this new USB C feature would it be possible
Optimize the same old shit designed phone and charge premium in the name of saving nature Apple in recent years has become worthless
Ill wait for another year with my 14pm
England Versus Apple in the battle of Newcordia And the winner is Brittania once again Britannia ruler of the type cs
"Now we dont have to buy a separate charger for iPhone
Tim  oh fu we made a mistake
Now people who buy an iPhone for the first time wont get a new charger
No 5 loss 
"
I can see it in your eyes Marques that even you are getting tired of Apples bullshit
USB C 20 speeds in 2023 Good job Apple
Im using 7  OG dont  get wrong  for me its not necessary maybe only thing is camera its  annoying me too much its time to change what thing
You seem disappointed
Umm do I have to buy an external dac to get hi res music to my cans
Thank you Really good review Exactly what we need to know I especially appreciate you mentioning some phones have USB 3 transfer speeds and some USB 2 speeds through USB C
I been an iPhone freak since day one and up graded every single time a new model came out so I can have the latest and greatest but this year Im just not buying into the fact that Apple waited this long to give us usbc as the focal point to upgrade and everything else is just wackIm gonna donate all my iphones I been collecting over the years to goodwill and go back to using the pay phone
Waited long enough and now finally bought the zflip5
I cant believe there is no fast charging Only 20w charging is absolutely ridiculous in 2023
Yes ssss Im sooooo tired of iphobe people looking down on me when I ask to borrow a charger like scoffwe only use lighting cables ol snooty phone users
France just banned Iphone 12 for high radiation readings so much for an apple a day keep the doc away lols
Is iphone still using Samsung parts to build this new iphone
I still have the 12 pro max Trying to decide what to upgrade to or wait another year 
Titanium will be way more prone to scratching than steel
Nah same phone as last year with usbc 
eu really is the savior
fcking 
Androids still the top dawg
They shrank the bezels wow They are almost as thin now as my 3 years old midranger Oneplus 8T Amazing job Apple
Gonna have to wait for the 16 to have a flat back
804 earlier you mentioned pink but dont mention it here Will it be an option then
I fall to sleep during the presentations they suck nothing new to me
Smartphones have peaked long ago I believe the next frontier should be augmented reality wearables I dont know what else you can do hardware wise to a phone Everything is now software iOS just needs to add multi tasking and work on improving Siri and maps and thats pretty much it Even with Samsung optical zoom gets better but thats pretty much it You can go the s22 ultra route with the pen but i have one and dont have much need for it Androids improvements are where its at
so the pro iPhones can be used without the cover  Waiting for the camera review as I am stuck on iPhone 13 with a shabby camera
Ill stick with my iPhone 14 for another few years maybe till 17 
In xiaomi and i belive many other phones blur already natural one so they no need portrait mode at all
Seriously one of the waste iphone it is nothing change just making fool of pplI use iphone 14 pro  max  same dudeaction mode n charge wht Wil b big difference in normal life 
Why you hyping up this useless upgrade man be real
That USB 20 vs 30 is some BS and really its a boring or actually disappointing update
When was the last time you plugged your phone in Two days ago actually Whenever my phone is full I tend to move photos and videos to external SSD
Oh my god Finally Google assistant quick button 
apple just implementing andorid things which are already there for many years and calling them revolutionary
Im waiting for iphone 20 pro max maby will be something more intresting
Your ps5 and xbox controller work now because USBC Apple now you have an opportunity for controllers for gaming
PS5 Controller literally everything is USBC not just mobile devices gaming is that way as well
"Another wonderful review  Thank you   This is the second time following an Apple event that I went to your channel first before watching the official production  

Im a sucker for the new cameras every year or two while staying within the ecosystem  So Ill pick this up and sell the 14 Pro Max  The 5x optical will be very nice at times  Im assuming lowlight sensitivity has improved which was already great but an amazing photo on the phone screen frequently translates to soso quality on a large screen  The steady transition to USBC is welcome even if they were forced to do it  Its been years since I backed up a phone to a drive but I may begin doing so again if the data transfer isnt tortuously slow    It will be nice to be able to transfer sets of photo  video to a machine at OK speed   

Side note on glass  steel  titanium   After many years of having multiple iPhones and dropping all of them many times usually with cases   I finally had the back glass shatter on my 14 under innocuous conditions at the beach  I think the case caused an undue focus of stress at a particular point while the manufacturers tripod  accessory attachment was attached   Manufacturer will remain nameless here but I was totally surprised and never would have guessed  And will never use a similar case until apple goes with all metal rear housing Titanium rails would not have helped one bit

Ill get the new max pro for the camera and other incremental upgrades  Sell the old one on Swappa like usual  Wish there was a fully functioning mini version with the best cameras  Oh well  "
Thank you for coming clutch I have the 11 right now and its been thru the ringer with me Now that the 15 pro is set to launch it might be time to upgrade
Thank EU for the port change
Why do people still buy Apple  just curious
Apple still trying to catchup Android  I guess a new USBC port makes sense  Its been at least 2 years
"Will be preordering iPhone 15 pro max 256gb 
Which color should i buy"
Fast charging is for iPhone 16 Pro Our fastest iPhone charging speeds ever
824 As someone who used to professionally repair phones as one of the few in the area to offer backglass replacement  the only to offer backglass ONLY replacement as opposed to transferring the internals to a completely new housing this a big thing for repairs imo If my friends need any part in their iPhone replaced I got them except backglass I dont have the tools for that anymore 
Finally I got my iPhone 6s 
apple can make their phones unbreakable in a flip of a switch but they make money off a repair
Huawei P60 is the big deal ever Lets go oooo
"I think Apple will increase charging speed every year on pro and max and the speed of the lower iPhones will take the speed of last year pro
As new feature"
The disappointment about iphone 15 is not even the usbc speed its the screen refresh rate 
I always feel like Apple holds back every time they release a new Iphone
damn its still square edged 
"Guys why everyone says the new iPhone has a bigger main sensor compared to the previous one
Both have 244um dont they"
Its not 5Ex its 5Times Drives me crazy
738 JerryRig noises
That 5X telephoto 
im on a 12 rn and im really debating getting a 15 pro or just waiting a year
If you see previous videos of his you would see him being very excited In this video he is really unexcited about it I am not surprised at all  The usb c is the only real change here Certainly not upgrade Material
"One thing for the Pro models that was briefly mentioned as the ability to take 3D photos which will be good future proofing for photos taken now 
There no major improvements from the 13 iPhone but the 15 pro definitely has future proofing"
I have a 10s and I think Ill just keep hanging on to it
Apple is a joke
Im not ready for a new iPhone yet but just wanted to see what the latest updates and features are Thanks for the review
Samsung seems to be innovating apple seems to be stuck
Omg i love lighter phone
Where are all these YouTubers incl Mkbhd that were certain that Apple would ditch ports altogether LOL They are pushing this trash opinion for at least 2 years now
Only thing I liked about this is that its lighter now
explain to me how a button is a pro feature
nah bc no usb 30 on the regular models is such bs
ALL ANDROID FEATURES COMING ONE BY ONE AT EXORBITANT PRICE
Apple has not changed as many things it needs to be changed its just over hyped 
Apple mentioned your name in there presentation 
Is the 15 Pro shipping with a high speed USBC cable or any cable at all
I dislike this phone
Lets be honest 99 of real buyers of this thing will not see any difference unless they upgrade from iphone 8 USB C revolution A few year later theyll make a fast charging revolution What a great company What a great army of loyal fans wholl buy literally everything
"The usb c cable will only work probably if you buy it from Apple
I dont really have any need to upgrade after the lose of a physical SIM I dont consider a phone which doesnt allow dual physical SIM Probably the only difference here that I see is the usb c Unfortunately i dont see any benefits here to upgrade to this"
I think Apple is trying to move us from being excited for the iPhone to other things that they are excited about like the vision pro Its a slow decline towards creating a new desire for a newer thing
it looks the same as last year lmao
finally something customizable on iphone hahahaa
Totally getting the iPhone 15 Pro or just the normal one
Google Pixel anyday
Nothing special about the spects Same design same everything just usb type c Nothing special about it type c has been around like decades Bragging as ig its special Apple is just outdated brand with no specific upgrade Only the pice hikes
I have iPhone 12 Pro should I upgrade
Cool features But Samsung been doing them since 2019 My 200 dollar A50 has lateraddblur feature
Getting the pro fasho cant wait
So the new button is just like any Samsung Galaxy phone for customized shortcutactions
Im in camp dont care at allId get an iPhone when apple makes ios open source
No iPhone Mini  Im really into small phones
I have a 13 pro but want a bigger screen Should I get the 14 pro max or 15 pro max The 15 pm is a bit disappointing 
should i buy 14 pro or 15 
About the color debate which one wins Blue or Natural titanium
Wait so the usb c is still the same charging time as lightning
Ill be upgrading to the new 15 plus due to still rocking the Iphone 11 It has served me well and since i thing it has been a good 4 years or so i think its time to upgrade to whats new and enjoy some of the new features that have been introduced along the way
Where can I get the wallpaper from the thumbnail
Are iPhone users still gonna ask do you have an iPhone charger
Even the Pro and ProMax models dont have faster charging I thought they would support 30W 33W or 35W 
Help please I have been using 6 plus for the last 10 years Does what I need  However because of some essential updates having stopped due to the age of my phone I need a new phone Which one do you recommend I only use my bank app YouTube and browsing And occasionally taking some photos Your advice is appreciated Thanks
Curious why the fuss for the charging cable when we still have a mess with power plugs all over Europe
For the 9 past years Im running on Android phones Dont even know why am I watching the review of vain iPhone upgrade
The headline says not just usbc but we all know it is just that Not even a fast one either
Im on a 11 pro max Still havent seen anything for the average user worth upgrading to I dont know what it will be but when it comes Ill be all over it
Genuinely not interested USBC makes a lit of my accessories a PITA to use Not wanting to add years of keeping up with adapters
as  an android user the usb c is actually a huge plus Now everyone can share chargers
What Im really interested in the new Huawei phone How on earth did they get the 5G technology on thier new phone with US sanctions damn its big slap from China on US and for fast charging I never think apple will use one soon because its pure Chinese technology and nah I never going to buy an iphone because its stupidly expensive and Im poor from 3rd world country
"I doubt if the usb will be only USB 2
From a Samsung S23 ultra user"
you know they didnt add fast charging bc they need something to add next time and they are running out of ideas
Always same thing 
Next year in the new Iphone Voila Now we have Fast charging in the Iphone for the first time ever
Had an xr for nearly 5 years would jumping to the 15 be worth it
Refuse to buy the new one since they got rid of lightning port
The 10th generation iPad already has USBC
Guys whats better atm iphone 15 or iphone 14 pro
I see that you did not mention the battery
Why big youtubers like you dont openly criticize Apple for having 60hz refresh rate and20 watt charging in such costly phones When RD team at apple is going to realise that they are way behind in the game in the name of innovation
The only reason for USBC is that Europe made Apple do it
"Since I bought the 1 TB version of the iPhone 13 Pro Max I was curious what the new maximum storage will be Answer 1 TB
Starting with the slowest USBC speed possible lets Tim announce next year that their new USBC is the fastest connectivity ever in an iPhone"
"Every single year I get increasingly underwhelmed by the improvements  and impressed how Apple doesnt give two hoots about what the market demands 

Its like Comrade Crook wants to see how much and how long Apple can disregard consumers and still post record results"
android been doing the action switch since the s10
Need to create a lighting cable version usbc are terrible
"Next upgrade for Iphone 16 pro max will come with fast charging
Iphone 17 pro max shape of power button has changed and brighter flash light"
This is the greatest thing since they invented the wheel 
a bunch of nothing to charge 1k for whoo i just have to have the same phone from last year makes no sense
Oh yay thanks EU now Ill have to buy usb c cables in addition to the lightning cables The ecologist will be happy
Within the next 10 years apple might also change the frame of the iphone from titanium to carbon fiber Just a guess 
"Type C is a big dealBUT  It matters what charging brick you use 

You cant use your Mac Air brick to charge your Samsung and vice versa 
Its still LAME"
Apple limiting USBC is such a bummer I feel like theyre limiting it now so next year they can claim that its faster only because theyre comparing to themselves
So basically whats new The phone has USBC something literally every other phone other than apple has and its 20g lighter wow titanium And it now has 5x zoom instead of 3x zoom crazy right Oh and they finally improved the battery capacity probably the only actual significant upgrade is going to be the slightly improved battery due to the capacity and new chip which you wont notice rhe performance in real world use at all so all in all i dont see how any of these models are worth the price especially the base models still running 60Hz for 800 in 2023 completely ridiculous Yet people will still jump on these things like their life depends on it
Ill use the new side button for the camera or flashlight other than that its the same stuff from apple every year change 1or2 things and claim these are the best iPhones ever well no shit Sherlock
iPhone 15  60Hz screen and typeC 2 with the same transfer speed as a lightning cable on a 800 phone ManThis company is a joke
Apple has become rotten with no more innovation
Camp Idc
When iPhone was young every year felt like a huge upgrade Were long past that which as a gadget lover is sad but theres still a lot to look forward to in terms of incremental upgrades Ill always welcome a better camera and software to support it The processor increases are kinda silly  since I cant really tell the difference between any of them in day to day use The next mind blower needs to be some new battery tech
Still happy with my Xr
So you tell me they added shit that was on other phones for years and now they added to their iphones and call it a new feature HOLY SHIT
I honestly dont care my iPhone 6s is holding up fine
iphone 15 is the one that makes the most sense If you are upgrading from iPhone 14 or earlier this is the one that has the most changes in comparison I think iPhone 15 is going to be the most popular iPhone
I think Ill keep using my iPhone 12 These upgrades this year just arent doing it for me I want an Apple foldable
Typically get a new iPhone every two years I love my 13 pro contemplating getting the 15 pro doesnt seem to be any new features that make it exciting  but idk Im on the fence  I was extremo disappointed we didnt get fast charging with the switch to usbc that was painful to hear 
Their best new feature is a feature that the government made them implement
Damnwe were all looking forward to USB C on the iPhone 15 but its actually disguised as USB 20 speeds Apple sure wants you to get the Pro instead to get those true USB 30 speeds Ughhha featured that Android already has without shelling out extra bucks lol
USBC was a requirement in a european Union Legislation Apple left the USB table over 10 years ago to sell their own thing and wall the garden now EU has forced them back on the table and either they help develop with everyone together now as was planned already when we got rid of those random printer cables or stop selling in one of their most profitable markets
so as usual its the same shit in another colour
meh same as 14 model
Hopefully we get some of the tech from southpole
Its sureal to see an iPhone with usb c Isnt that such a sad comment to make
I dont like having usbc charging port cause it always gets faulty and broken Lightning was the best
"I liked how you anticipated the audiences perception of why they are watching this video

I watched this video to see how Apple is planning to dupe people with the new line up"
Spend 1700 because there is a USB connection you people need to stop with iPhone and start boy cotton apple 
I still have my pixel 6 enjoying a good laugh at the new iP
Still no always on on IPhone
My 12 is still going strong but idk might get a 15
new button which is same button just programmable apple outdone itself
Eh guess Ill keep using my 13
Wow they have a USB port Pathetic Apple sucks
I watched a tiktok of watching you watching this
Why do people spend so much for so little improvement
"I only had an iphone once iphone x then a galaxy note and now a fairphone Iphones are out of consideration until Apple allows the same level of customization as Android AND the same environmental friendliness like Fairphone along with the sustainable and FAIR wages policy for the workers Until then  its just ewaste no matter what incremental improvements there are Smartphone usefulness has peaked years ago What i need and use my phone for is offered by phones from 2019 more than sufficiently 

Apple has a long way to go to catch up"
How many of you saw Samsung ad in this video 
Soooo USBC 
60hz is no no
756 
No wireless charging for your earbuds from your phone 
"Wow
Amazong how they manage to give you nothing significantynew but people keep getting on board
Keep fighting capitalism my brothers"
now you can plug in samsung earphones to your iphone 
Add portrait effect after the shot is a feature  in Samsung phones for a couple of years
"Apple calls MKBHD in emergency  please find an arguement other than USBC we offer you 500k

MKBHD  okey Ill do my best "
This is the least gotta have it release in iPhone history That said Im looking forward to getting all this in a 16
is it just me or is your video really glitching
"im a little underwhelmed but im not complaining theyve updated a lot more than the samsung S series in the last year honestly the base 22 to 23 was literally just a slightly better battery and front camera newer processor and was a tenth of an ounce lighter

i think Apple just gets way too technical in their announcements for people to appreciate the changes and understand what it means for daily use the vast majority of iPhone users just hear 6core GPU neural engine etc and conclude its not a big deal because it goes over their heads which isnt their fault its hard to be excited about words you dont know

i think apple should really just highlight what it all means for average users anyone actually into the tech will look deeper into the specs"
225 dosent soundfeel right u wanna say that u can use 1 cable for all thats not how apple operates or is that the eu law or maybe u can charge but no data transfer
The best Fail apple
Yawn 
"2023 and apple has finally reached the same features Android phones have been ginving us for YEARS 
I wont even mention that android Galaxy S lineup is still WAY BETTER better telephoto fast charging better programming options for phisical button"
I have an iPhone and a macbook and AirPods So I wouldnt say Im an apple hater I understand those getting an upgrade coming from 23 gens back Or coming from none apple territory But those of you getting the 15 coming from last years are what give apple the cult like consumerist stupidity its known for Youre all sheep Its the same phone as last year Hate on me if you want I dont read replies
"Dont need it
Dont really care
But ngl it will be pretty nifty when I eventually upgrade in the future even tho it would get old in bouta week

Really Im waiting for when the Iphone can run games better than the nintendo switch

I have a dream where nintendo isnt worried ab selling consoles and puts the new mainline pokemon games on the Iphone 25
Id easily shell out 100200 just for the base game if they really had to make up for the consoles they may not sell"
Still on iPhone 8 and I dont see why I should upgrade
why no huawei mate60 impression
Coming from 13 pro max 15 pro max make sense Especially for on the road photo marketing quick snaps
Watching on my z fold 5 lol
I have the base model iPhone 13 I I wanted to get the iPhone 14 pro but decided to wait for the 15 and well I think am making the upgrade to the 15 pro for the cameras and 120hz but will be missing the silent switch as others are saying in the comments
My 12 pro max is still going strong no reason to change this season Probably not on the next release as well
ill wait for the 16 lol
So essentially its the same phone as last year with the legally mandated USBC port that they didnt want to use anyway God IPhone is kinda tired
AHHHH THE SHEEPPPP BAAAHHH
"Bro dont say to subscribe to your channel Im with you for like 3 or4 years and Im watching your videos and you And mrwhoistheboss is my favourite tech youtubers and you guys rules the tech scene 
What Im trying to say is if a guy watching your video for the first time he will subscribe to your channel for no doubt Im writing this small texts like or 20 minutes because my my display sucks So god bless you bro have a good day  i hope you like like my comment "
bla bla bla the only reason I could think to buy an apple product is security other than that I dont see any reason
Is it just me or is this the smallest generational upgrade theyve ever done
My bank account likes this new iPhone I have absolutely no reason to spend another thousand dollars this year 
You mean the 15th iphone
Sounds like I dont need to upgrade from my 14 pro max until next year maybe
Great tech good job on the usbC finally Sad that the biggest thing is the USBC smh If you have the 13 or 14 this upgrade isnt necessary at all
They will add thunderbolt port on next year iphone pro models
Team samsung here lol  apple for catching up to the new age
here to see if its worth it thx for the in depth review
They are saving Fast charging for iPhone 20
In the name innovation nothing is new there just old one in new box
Got to say Ive had nearly every I phone but Apple seriously Im not seeing any great change here from the 14 action button really Apple have got start moving into the foldable market and start changing the game a little more
The era of share cable with Android users begun
W
The titanium is used here only to reduce the weight With weight it also brings down the impact on fall Titanium is more prine to scratches and dents than steel Othe than that if we are just looking at the strength  steel is still harder than titanium
Pro max costs 1900 dollars in India 
Im just watching to see if its worth it
apple is crazy ill hold my 14pm lets wait 15pm
You have a good liqucking skill new iphone is ehh
In the end its a fken phone Think of it as the governments new and improved gps locator for you
The new action button on the Pro models should be able to hold down for Mute and short press for the action you would like
"Well in 7 years this is the only iPhone that feels worth upgrading to and I will be 

That says a lot about how the company sucks and how behind times it is"
I loved this iPhone review Thanks
Love my 14 pro dont have any issues with it
The fact that MKBHD had his name mentioned in the apple keynote and yet his reviews are honest and critical when required Thats when you know this guy cant be bought
The favorite feature is the new button   
I CANT WAIT TO TRADE IN my iPhone 14 MAX it had so many issues
Im in camp dont care  iPhone 13 for me
Paid promotion
Apple is running out of ideas
Id like one just for the prores stuff but I dont do enough filming for it to be worth it yet
I have the 14 pro max and Ive had an iPhone since the 6 came out This is pointless is the same exact phone I dont think theres any reason to change your phone if you have the 12 1314  of course the software is gonna slow your phone down and theyre gonna make you buy the new one Apple is starting to suck
The phone is dope
Saw the commercial for the new IPhone Its hilarious how they tout the ultra fast new USBC connector
How about externa display iPad functions
i have an iphone 12 to me this phone is basically the same as mine
Its crazy how he recorded this video with a red camera
Camp S24 Ultra
Same design same thing over and over and over and over with iPhone There is so so many better phones or phones that are just as good that are different every yr I get why people stay because the iPhone has u stuck in there eco system But people do not want something different Im not saying they are not nice because they are Its just the same thing yr after yr  Look at Google they have a brand new sensor that can take your temp and all brand new features we have never seen on a phone Etc etc
Definitely a grab 
just another expensever Iphone
Camp Getting 1  Just to stay on the edge of trade in value 
Apple finally caught up with the rest of electronics industry
"Thanks for the summary  I have a 13 Pro Max currently and was planning to wait until next year to upgrade  but what changed my mind was both the much better camera zoom of the new Pro Max and also the AAA calling ability of the satellite emergency feature

I plan to go with the white model though the natural finish is very tempting as well  Have a darker one currently and just want to change it up a bit

Its interesting that I found it so compelling even though the feature updates seemed minor  Apple does a great job I think of making what seem to be minor updates but if you have a phone from two years ago or more the updates look great"
"One thing I really miss from back in my jailbreak days
Is the possibility to press and hold volume buttons to skip songs

I cant stand having to pull out my phone whenever I want to change the song And dont tell me about Siri guys"
and thats a change pushed by the EU 
Maybe you see this comment Maybe you dont Great job Ive watch a handful of your vids and content and you are doing great work I appreciate your comments point of view and sheer quality of work
Crazy how MK managed to talk so much about the same thing as last year
No mute switch is a deal braker to me
Apples strength is the closed ecosystem Interesting to see their progression Not quite innovators any longer just refining already proven tech Apple is safe now
Comment section always open unlike on Oprahs videos
Marques Shillee shilling the least impressive iPhone to date
Im using my 14 Pro max now and its relieving that 15 pro max actually didnt get anything noteworthy except USBC 
Fastcharging degrades batteries faster than 1520watt charging It also has the habit of making my phone die at 50 charge
I upgraded from an 8 plus to a 13 back in March after 4 years of use Im sticking with my 13 for now
"i feel like with the price of their phones they should at least come with a basic phone case or put the wired earphones and adapters back in the box this is ridiculous no matter how you flip it

yeah its cool that they didnt raise the prices but theyre still overcharging for the same phone they are getting away with it now but hopefully theyre smart enough to do something different before people get fed up and actually start looking elsewhere"
"Thanks
1 I previously thought that a USB C cable was a USB C cable Wrong there are cables and cables with big differences in capabilities between various cables 
2 No faster charging is certain to be simply to look after the battery Really fast charging creates plenty of heat and will kill batteries much faster"
They lack for innovation I dont see any changes but they just changed the 14 Why do you deceive people Apple using my 23 Ultra The beast
Another Gadget Which I Cannot Currently Afford But Still Watching 
So what is really new about 15
Gotta love apple holding back on thunderbolt so next year they have something new and push usb3 speeds to the lower models
Do they add close all apps button
Im surprised that Apple did not showcase or give a preview of iOS 17 which is due for release in a few days time Especially considering that the new iPhones will all be having iOS 17 preinstalled
Dont care Happy with my 13 Pro Max
and after all those years people still keep saying Apple is innovative  really 
Glad they went with a satin back like the ipads I hate glossy glass on my current iphone
I got more excited about the Nothing Phone 2
The iphone is such a scam lol
Guess android is winning with this usb type c shift whoop whoop
I always choice the pro but with the zoom camera of the max im a mess I feel the pro max TOO BIG  im 175cm tall  do you think that the 5x worth it I dont know what to do thanks to all for your replies
i need opinions ive had an iphone 11 for a good while now The battery health is 78 ive been feeling like upgrading for a while now is the 15 pro worth it or would yall recommend and older version
"458 Correction Ray tracing is definitely new here Hardwareaccelerated ray tracing is mostly a consoledesktop GPU feature and this is the first time iPhone gets it It probably means it will come to M3 or M4 for Macs its one of the feature deficits of Apple Silicon GPUs now and iPads On Android side I think you need something like Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 which is also very new They also said the A17 now supports mesh shaders which is a newer types of shaders that Metal 3 supports which is actually a bigger deal than ray tracing because it allows you to port games written using a modern pipeline over without bending yourself backward and rewriting things Edit Actually I think mesh shader has been in iPhones for a few years now I think if you care about mobile gaming this is actually a big change but its funny how its the Pro phone getting gaming features

Rumors via The Information last year was that Apple wanted to get this in for A16 but failed so seems like this is arriving one year late"
who else saw the caption 799 for 15 and 899 for the 15 plus 403
Its cool It wouldve been a bit cooler if they wouldve moved it a bit so your fingers arent always in the way of the camera when you go to use it for the camera
Damn Apples biggest new feature is the one that they were reluctantly forced into why anyone outside of secure work phones buy these I have no idea
600  Even if you are using a dock with 1gbps ethernet hdmi mirroring and a gen4 nvme ssd u still wont saturate 10gbps 20gbps and 40gbps usb4 on an iphone will basically never be worth apples efforts Look at how much die space that usb3 controller used 40gbps could use double that space and even more power
Thanks for the apple  for taking years to bring type c
u should compare ur self when you talk about another brands to how u talk about apple products hhh
Ehhhhh Ill hold on to my 12 Mini
No fast charging that is a little too Android for Apple lol A superior device needs no gimmick such as fast charging A real enthusiast will wait 1h 49mins 55sec to fully charge this is the way
They didnt change their ports to type c by choice it was forced by the EU  democracy 
when charging watch or airpodsbuds just putting on the back of your phone is very common nowadays apple still introducing charging ur airpods by wire Comeon apple wake up pls Apple is realy making us fool
Horrible sound Sorry Marques I could not stand the poor sound in this video
It doesnt look much of an update Im not buying
Does the 15 finally have a setting for max charge percentage So far not seeing a real benefit for upgrading from my 13 Pro
USBC is quite disapointing  and another reason why USBC is the new VHS vs Beta moment as the more popular won not the better Thunderbolt
Wild it still has a camera notch Just behind the times and DOA like usual
Want to know why there is no fast charging Apple holds back technology on purpose so they can introduce it the following year Every year Apple puts out a new with a chip upgrade and a camera upgrade Apple is the most predictable product maker on the planet So next year I predict Apple will announce the iPhone 16 and 16 plus which will both have yet a better chip and better cameras But only the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max will get the fast charging People who buy just the iPhone or the plus will have to wait until iPhone 17 to get fast charging Mark my words
Can use the same title from the Samsung video They Settled 
The speaker holes on the bottom are doing my head in 3 on the left 5 on the right Why not just have 5 or 3
"They need to have different presses  on the action button do different things Then I will be impressed
1 Push once
2 Push and hold
3 Double Push
4 Push once and hold on second push
5 Triple Push"
Wow iphone 15 has a new feature its called USB TYPE C
Goodness its all the same They just are copying Android
did they fix the lens flare
NOTHING CHANGE JUST THE CHIPSET AND NERFED CHARGING PORT NOT DURABLE THAN OLD IPHONES
East or west Samsung is the best
Titanium is a great material My Apple Watch Ultra has had almost a year of hard use including scuba diving and rock climbing There is not a scratch ding or dent Its also much lighter and weight was a deal killer for me and the Pro models before
nothing news for years Apple needs to step up sorry 1 news a usb port Huge for Apple fans
Not interested in the 15 model due to no any changes in design
nope
Probably fast charging will come in future models when they claim the chip now supports it or similar
I want display port over USBC on the phone so you could plugin to an external monitor or tv
Keeping my iPhone 13 Pro Max I dont see any reason to upgrade Not only that but I dont like being the dude that jumps to any new tech paying 1400 usd to use the same features
I got a 14 pro When should I upgrade 
Thanking about getting the 15 pro max as my secondary phone I have a galaxy 23 right now
At this point apple is just bringing out new color options every year and nothing else 
My biggest reason for going with Android last time was literally usbc I guess Im out of excuses
Last iPhone I owned was the 3G god awful phone Been with android since and been wanting to switch Currently on the s20 ultra would like something new Its sad that you have USB c but no fast charging
I dont know at the same time I really am pleased with USBC charging but do I really want to spend extra on a 15 pro Im debating on upgrading from my 11 to a 14 pro max hopefully the prices go down a bit or pre ordering the 15 pro max  pro
the action button to me is not a upgrade I bet most people would still prioritize mute function over anything else and when it acts as a mute button a switch is just the superior design as it immediately tells you your phones mute status at a glance
Marcus knows about Apple and still being naive about not getting features like fast charging 
espaol Please
All of these influencers are merely assisting in the promotion of a weak product Talking about cameras everywhere most of those photos are for social media In addition what is the purpose of a professional camera
I personally do not like USBC Anyone that works in any trade such as construction or any physical labor jobs always gets debris into the charge port On the lighting you can just get a pick to remove the debris without damaging anything on the inside but with usb c you always risk damaging the pins inside the connector and dont have much room around it to get debris that are stuck Yes its a small thing but for some people it does make a difference
Not a single F was given about the Vision Pro video mode 
Since this new action button can do all of that why didnt they gives us the ability to have a list of apps when we tap  hold the dynamic island They couldve did so much more with the dynamic island
Did 14 not just come out
iPhone 14USB C IPhone 15
They is nothing new or nothing exciting about it what is the difference between this and 14 absolutely nothing
Titanium isnt that much stronger than regular steel its just that its the same strength for half the weight
Should I upgrade I have the 12 pro max thinking of going to 15 pro max or should I wait for 16 for fast charging
Sooooooo when is the iphone flip coming out 
I would make the side button an SOS to call local authorities But i have pixel 7 so im ok
Its time to replace my 11 pro max I wanted to wait for USB C so its all good
I was gonna upgrade to the 15 from a XS and even tho it will be a big upgrade for me Im still not super impressed by this Usbc is pretty sick but still I expected just a little bit more
Apple is stale AF
"For iphone 15 and 15 plus at least they should have given 90hz display and 15 pro and pro max should have same camera setup
Now iphone 16 pro will have  iphone 15 pro max camera setup and iphone 1616 plus will get action button
Apple bi like no Add one feature and continue with it for 23 years lol"
LoL brand fanboysgirls kill me
"Need help form you  

I am on iphone 11 and was waiting for a upgrade to next only if it had the usb c And this is it 
For me to upgrade to iphone 15 would be only and only if I can access my external drives SDD HDD and pendrives as well as to be able to hook it on to the monitor using the usb to hdmi port If I can do these things then its bye bye iphone 11 and ipad air 4 for me and just pick the iphone 15 up which would do the work of both the devices 

So what do you think 
Is it the right and justifiable way to go forward as soon as the reviews are out and capabilities of the usb c are clear in a couple of days"
You could have it order you food that button lol 
Still 60hz on standard model
In US iphone pro max 256 1199  india iphone 15 plus 256 1199 Rip custom charges
that camera looks silly
so they now embed tristar chip into processor nice wrong cable  charger  it just fkd up by itself make your integrated tristar dead you cant replace it like the other iPhone with standalone tristar chip
Im on the upgrade program so Ill be getting the 15 Pro Sort of excited but I really wish the 5X optical zoom were available on the nonMax I cant do the huge phone
I was kinda on board then I saw no purple I know they never really keep the feature color from the previous year but I really like the purple But also I think I will wait until the 16s to even upgrade again my 14pro is just fine
Literally in the name of saving environment apple destroying it first of all they didnt used usbC and it forced people to carry and buy different cables for their electronic devices and now they are using USB c which force apple users to buy new cable and maybe after couple of years they will introduce wireless charging which will create even more e waste by usb c
Apple  Giving you 20 year old technology Today
Camp dont care at all
marques and his biased reviews
Very underwhelming lineup specially the pros
At this point in life I dont care 
I have never used an iPhone before I hope the 15 pro is mine this time 
Could you compare 15 plus to Pro Max Thanks
Was thinking that I could have and old phone  by chance any brand I dont mind 
Pointless updates this year not gonna buy it
Nothing new
"Had 1st Gen iphone when Jobs was around it was alright But I didnt like how everything has to be locked into Apples own eco system even transferring photos  files switched to Android 2 years later and never looked back 

It is just laughable how usb c just got introduced to the 15 while Android phones had this default port for years Wake the F up apple fan boys how are you still paying apple for these pointless changes "
The last year with the iPhone 14 Pro Max has opened a whole new world in my photographic toolset Im very excited to try out the new cameras and 5x telephoto on the new phone with Halide app of course
This new iPhone is joke man same phone again
Nice phone Reminds me so much of my iPhone 12 
They are saving Fast charging for iPhone 20 They are saving Fast charging for iPhone 20
No one cares Or shouldnt it about the color of the edges how smooth the back is etc after you put a case on which is prolly 80  of users that makes no difference
I bet you iPhones going Wireless
Shoot I thought thered be little display on the back side No point to upgrade from my 14 Pro Max then 
Im on 11 pro Should i wait another year for 16 pro max My phones destroyed almost but still going ape shit strong Confus3d sh33p 
Just Dont BY APPLE PHONES THEY ARE LIKE 10 YEARS BEHIND GALAXY Phones
Coming from someone who loves everything apple imma sit this one out stick with the 14pro max I have like the action button but I need more to wow me over still saving some coins because I am going to jump Im vision pro
Well I think the biggest feature of the 15 pro Is ability to shoot pics and vids in spatial video With the vision pro coming out soon this could be a huge feature
A bunch of nothing
Its only usb c actually
Tell me something What can these phones do that you paid a small fortune for I mean even the cheapest 50 phone is enough for me to make calls and watch YouTube Why throw a pile of money out the window when you will never use it in this stinking life
"Awesome review production and presentation You were lauding the feature that allows you to record directly to external storage via the USBC port

On my V60 Ive been recording video directly to my 1tb SanDisk Extreme PRO microSDXC UHSI CARDwhich cost me 139 on sale After video is recorded I pop the card out of my phone slide it in the adapter into the computers SD slot then download into my laptop No wires no fuss

That said for people immersed in the iPhone ecosystem the 15 line appears superlative For me I still need the 35mm jack external storage and that incredible 32bit HiFi QuadDAC which puts headphones by dongle and Bluetooth headphones to shame"
Why dont they just make the back of the phone out of thin aluminium or good old plastic instead of that flimsy and really dumb glass Clearly they want the repair sales I do not think there can be any other justification And with aluminium or plastic it would be lighter if weight is the dream
Now i am really depresseed about iphones The thing is there is nothing interesting in the iphone when comparing to a new android phone Now even i think just watching these iphone 15 videos are a big time waste
Underwhelmed and will probably switch back to Samsung for my next phone
Whats the refresh rate on the base iPhone 15 Still 60
I have the 8 Plus time for an upgrade 
Finally USB C We can thank the EU
Camp Dont Care at All I have a 14 Pro If I upgraded now my wife and I have to have 2 cables in every car Until we hit a couple generations with USBC this will affect most families That said I want it I always want the new iPhone but I think this is a generation I can skip Same form factor for the watch as well Good waiting until next time unless its the same again
"Cool Apple finally has the port everyone else has been using for like 6 years now Maybe theyll get fast charging in another 3 years 
I guess theyll have to sell this sht cheap bc whos going to buy this lol"
Imagine creating a USB C port on 2023 and not only bragging about it but keeping it at USB 2 speeds Hah Give me a break
 IM IN CAMP IPHONE 16 Nothing worth upgrading for in my opinion We are 100 years behind special access program tech so why the hell do we have to wait so long for basic things Oh wait I cant even change my Home Screen dock without having to jailbreak so who am I kidding expecting more 
"Next iPhone actual innovation
1 Top notch needs to be completely hidden
2 Get rid of dirty fingers dynamic island thats what Apple watch is for
3 Get rid of the aggravation action button It gets bumped accidentally all the time and changes functions on its own 
4 Get rid of all the side buttons go 100 touch screen
5 Upgrade battery life to all week power and eventually to all month
6 Upgrade charging speeds to at least match or surpass the competition"
Finally USBC Camp I like all the new stuff but not worth an upgrade I will continue to wait
Now no more excitment for new apple product Some simple changes then new Iphone is ready Its a Sad reality of Apple
Waiting for 15 pro max release As i didnt switch in a few years I was in for 14 pro max But to be honest 15 pro max is bit better So i will now go for 15 pro max  hold it for 23 years
NO FAST CHARGING iPhone users never had fast charging till now
Im on the t21 days for Pixel 8 Pro camp
From what Im seeing and hearing this new iPhone is not interesting at all
Came here  to watch about iphone 15 and here the ad of samsung 
The fact they dont give you a lightning to c converter or a power block shows theyre getting cheaper and dont care about the environment like they claim no not interested in this iphone
Nah Ill stick with my 14 pro No point in upgrading for usb C and a customizable button Ill only use for silent mode
I think what people are looking for is design Apple need to make their cameras flush with the phone
Quick question will the new stuff on iPhone 15 coming to iPhone 14 pro as well Like the new camera and stuff Because from the way i see it hardwarewise they both are almost the same thing
What Other people are saying it does have higher watt charging
I think if people like you that are experts and also have a large following held Apple to a higher standard than perhaps wed get more innovation from Apple
really what im worried about is that although the iPhone 13 is still available the Mini is not RIP to reasonablysized phones
Its the same iphone again and the usb c is because of the eu not because they cared
wow disapointing took them that long to make it usb c WOW
No fast charging is a big let down for me I spend majority of my days on a worksite on phone calls taking site photos for reports sometimes commissioning videos which drain my battery and only get to be in the office for an hour or so Fast charging would be so beneficial for users that dont spend all day in the office and can leave it on charge
I really enjoy your videos but come on  This is literally an iPhone 14 with a USBC port  I feel like you are obligated to talk this release up because they quoted you in the launch event
At this point apple is making want to switch to a Samsung
I kinda want one but do I NEED it
courage
Just when Huawei offers satellite phone feature on their phone and cheaper and faster funny that usbc is a key feature when everyone else is on that for years
Action button is nice feature but in a wrong placement
My take on the usb 20 for the 1515 plus is that most normal people just dont plug in to transfer files so they wouldnt even notice the difference My main annoyance is that I just bought new AirPods gen 2 I had to return the gen 3 where they kept falling out of my ears and I dont like inear buds like the pros Im due an upgrade so Ill probably be getting a new iPhone but Ill have to keep my lightning cable around ONLY TO CHARGE MY AIRPODS
"The big thing I am missing from the action button as with the action button on the ultra is that you cannot make a automation when a focus is set the action button is set to something that works for that focus

This way you have a multi purpose with the action button one for home one for outside one for work etc not just limited to one shortcut
And yes you can make it a shortcut menu but those are two presses really hope they will give us the option to make this work in automations  shortcuts to customise the button "
whatever apple puts out  there are people out there who would by the phone regardless of the specifications just to show how RICH they are but any day of the week ANDROID wins
In 2023 you can buy a 2000 usb20 phone without fast charging
13 ProMax Vs 14 ProMax Vs 15 ProMax
I bought the iPhone 13 Pro when it launched and its my ride or die until it gives up the ghost By the time it dies Apple will have added a bunch of new features
630 my iPhone 12 already charges in less than 30 minutes to 80 how fast do you want it to charge
But what about the battery tho
I wonder if Apple give free Iphones to the children who mine the Cobolt needed for these phones
Ive had an iphone X since it came out and I was holding out to get a 15 with usb C but this is really really underwhelming tbqh Like Im considering an android at this point what is the benefit here
Idk why Im watching this I have been android since iphone 7 but USB C is a regulatory requirement to save ewaste because it was so wasteful how apple cables could only be used with apple products it has been like this for years now in Europe and finally caught up If you need speed faster than usbc you should probably have a laptop with a thunderbolt cable because its a mobile phone not a workstation My phone fasts charges on usb C in about 55minutes Thats an apple thing if they give you everything what will they have next year Thats why it is filled with last years tech and stuff that has been in phones for years I was standing looking at a galaxy s10 and a 10pro and The samsung made more sense because I could plug a jump drive in with an adapter for just one instance I was apple guy since iphone 3 I remember watching keynote for 4 There are so many features apple puts out that android has had forever In my opinion apple has not pushed the limits since Jobs passed they are just carrying on with what he had Im sure they had ideas he had but they had to run out after a generation or so The big thing for me was the cameras the fact they put a 12 mp camera in the X was what made me switch took me 2 months to learn the phone 2 weeks in I wanted to go back to apple but now its great Idk if apple does split screen but that is a game changing thing for taking notes or doing two different actions on different websites at the same time
I think I am going to go have a salad
nothing revolutionary in the iPhone 15 pro max to upgrade to it Apple is just creating a hype and taking its customers for a ride
I dont care about 15 13 all day
"I think Ill keep my 14 pro for a couple of years until a major update

What about wireless Wire to wire "
"preordering the 15 Pro max
coming from a 13 Pro
cant wait"
Gonna sell less than the 14 plus  Which is what apple deserves
What was the point of your airline short Pointless video as always keep up the good work
Still cant justify upgrading my iphone XS Max
Anker is the best Happy to see them sponsor you
I still have the 12PRO I dont know if I should switch to the 15PRO Max 
Apple out in these tech streets acting like they had a choice in putting USBC on iPhones The EU said Knuck if you buck Apple said no thanks Well comply
Im sorry but finally going to usb still no fast charging adding a button and slightly improving software and cameras a joke Really Be innovative and not just pumping out slightly improved copies way behind other manufacturers
Im always in camp dont care  I do watch the updates just to check out the new phone  But I will never buy the latest and greatest phone  I always buy a generation or two behind the latest and greatest because it is just as good as it was when it came out 2 years ago but now it is much cheaper
Rip lightening cable 
Cant wait for all the android did it first
Its the same ducking phone  how sad
Ive got a 12 pro max and so Im overdue for a new phone Its still in mint condition so Ill definitely sell it to buy the new one but Im disappointed I was hoping for something more significant than usb 30 and camera upgrades 
Ill wait to see your full review on the Pro Ive got the 14 Pro now and love it but because this is my first iPhone after being on Android for 12 years Ive never been a fan of how heavy it is So USB c and a lighter weighed iphone doesnt sound like a bad idea but well see
Its crazy how USB C is a major thing for the iPhone 
Damn 68 million views in less than 24 hours Youre the man MB 
definitely waiting for you to test out the phone first to see if is worth getting
Does Apple ever do anything new Why do we have to have a whole new phone to do what they can do one simple update
Seems like theres not much to the iPhone 15s seems like all the major changes went to the IOS17 software update
I cant believe we are at the IPhone 15
Same crap different color
We have nothing mmm here you go Type apple C 
Soooo same phone basically
I have a 12 Pro Max We have a baby on the way and Id like to have the upgraded camera for Photos and Videos of the little one growing up I do feel though that there isnt the need any more to move forward with buying the latest and greatest every release Features have been small upgrades and at this point I dont use my phone except for some browsing messaging and as a phone
Can it run StumbleChat at 24 broadcasts fully Just curious 
This feels like the most uninspired iphone release ever Usb c is the main difference
the real question to be answered while the back glass is easier to replace if broken what about the screen cause sorry but not paying to fix it
Still the same as the iphone X from 2017 waiting for a redesign
overpriced apart from the camera quality
So its old wine in a new bottle no innovative features or something that the World has not seen in most of the Android phones Bummer that the baseline iPhone 15 phones do not have fast charging available 
Wasnt lightning like Apples signature port
Trash no new nthinng nobody cares about titanium bs we are putting a case on it anyway where is split screen multitasking where is a good calculator that keeps the history Apple needs us to rebel against them keep your 13 pro maxs and 14s
meh I got a 14 pro already Nothing tech breaking here
As a never Iphone always Android user its whatever But the best part about this launch for me is that I no longer have to carry any extras lightning cables for my wife She is constantly forgetting her charger cord Upgrading from Iphone X so its a decent upgrade in camera and chip if nothing else We got our moneys worth out of the X so Im not mad at it
What a joke Crapple Pass
Ill stick to my 8s
Im waiting on a new iPad Pro Hopefully even with a bigger screen than 129
honestly thought i might upgrade from 13pro but honestly not impressed with any of the new features except maybe the usbc but if you ask if im ugrading its a no from me
turns out only putting usb c on iphone can break Marquess outro
"For Americans its for 999 and 
for Indians its for just 1626
Great"
Basically the same stuff we have from android years ago try android and youll never go back to apple
The only reason that I got the 12 is because I thought we were getting type C so I got the 12 promax however Verizon is offering 1000 off so Im trading in this 12 promax for the 15 Pro Max just for the type C
Come on Tesla phone already
I am surprised that iPhone still has no 8K video recording where many smartphones such as Samsung Galaxy have for a few years now It is nice to see quadruple the camera resolution for stills 48 MP from 12 MP for the past several years about time we got a still photo boost Am looking forward to this new model
Yeah no big deal that it ran the resident evil remake with ray tracing Totally happening on every other phone at the moment
iPhone is becoming Call of Duty
Ive been on the fence about moving to iOS the rest of my ecosystem is all Macs but Apples trickle charge of changes didnt push me over the edge Everything left me feeling like the next phone is probably the one that will have real changes So while Im still on the fence Im happy enough in Pixel land to probably sit tight until Apple announces something that is actually exciting
i usually get the new iphone pro every year however this will be my first year skipping a release i really see no reason to upgrade from the 14 pro ill wait
Ive got an iPhone 10 Totally happy with it and see no reason to upgrade
Basically theirs nothing new about it they brought back the button switch the trim to plastic look  The design getting outdated
boring release UBS C is so old school on phones good to have but doesnt make it anymore interesting than just not changing phone
Dafuq no white variant for iphone 15
my 13PM still works just fine
I was really hoping youd say the action button can be programmed for single double and triple press so that the button can act as the silent switch and open whatever you choose with different presses  This is why I wish untethered jailbreaking were still common
This USBC stuff is revolutionary new iPhone technology Apple is really still innovating and destroying the phone market android could never 
I guess everyone forgot that Android only had Micro USB back in 2012 How garbage was that connector compared to lightning
So same shit Different skin
They need to do better iPhone 15 is a joke
I wonder how many accessories are gonna be block by proprietary cable limitations
Looks like they brought the same blue color my 12PM has back Since Apple stopped innovating I see no reason to upgrade but will likely try one out once they are in stores Curious what they will do with the next SE Hopefully it will be based on the Mini with improved battery life
Why No pink on pro max Im angry
"456
Thats EXACTLY the moment I know this chip is good

IF it can run any of the game shown nicelybase graphics constant 30 fps then its basically game over cuz these games titleRE AC arent joking"
The 15 Pro Max 1TB is nearly 3k local dollars 2899 where I am LOL
They need to bring back the Mini
Another year another wasted event like seriously Huawei 60 pro plus is destroying apple apple got lucky trump ban them from the us or they would have been struggling on sales
Are YouTubers getting biased now Theres absolutely nothing special about the iPhone 15 Yet idk why MKBHD is speaking so will about it A 800 phone has a 60 hz refresh rate Android phone that costs 300 has minimum 90 hz 
Is the iPhone 15 esim only 
Yall really buying the exact same phone year after year lol
Wut 3 nanometers
Youd think Apple would make a major upgrade because its the 15th version of the iPhone What a disappointment Ill pass Still waiting for the notch to disappear I wonder how long itll take for apple to join everybody else with the true full screen Getting tired of waiting
Super informative and honest video as always Love the channel Cant wait for the full review Also I see you there in first class haha
Still years behind Android
"I will be trading my iPhone 14 Pro Max for the 15 Pro Max The only thing Im disappointed about was the battery iOS 16 literally destroyed it went from 100 to 90 in less than a year meanwhile my iPhone 12 that i had before is going strong with 84 health after almost 3 years and is still being used by a family member I know its not worth the upgrade but since my plan is making it possible why not 
Great video as always "
getting really tired of apple sprinkling miniscule upgrades while samsung is lightyears ahead of apple every single year
every rich will buy it because it is apple
Cant believe that USB C is the most important aspect of a new phone in 2023
we all know that apple has the technology and capability to add the features we all want but then that would get rid of their reason to charge all this money every year for a slightly better phone
Nice features
Its the Apple way slow progression makes more money
Yo the iPhone 15 is EVERYTHING I have wanted from an iPhone in the last 5 years I have the 12 Pro Max and Im totally getting the 15 Pro Max in either Blue or Natural Just as soon as I can afford it 
"Nooo they took the mute switch away The one tactile  visual control that works without me needing the screen to be on at all Yuck 

I wonder what their rationale is"
think about this you will need apple certified usb c cable if the cable is not certifierd the phone wont charge
Being that I have the 13 pro max I skipped the 14 but I may get the 15 pro simply because of the type c switch Everything I own uses type c now
I could see myself  setting the default zoom to something like 12x I take a LOT of pictures of cars and the 1x is too wide of an angle not good for cars
Apple cult fan boy nothing new to see here
eh Ill stick with my 13 pro its still plenty powerful for my uses and I much prefer lightning as a charge port it just holds up better than any C device Ive owned I get the want for a universal cable still FWP ASF but C is just kind of a pisspoor design durability wise so ill be hanging onto my lightning phone for as long as I can and with how insignificant the last several updates have been I feel like my 13 pro will remain valid for another 34 years
you know times have changed when the biggest feature for a highly anticipated iphone is the charging cable 
I believe people will still get new iphones even if they dont add new features Features that they removed couple years ago
If my iPhone 11 Pro Max wasnt having issues Id absolutely stick with it Over still excited for the 15 pro max my biggest issue is the flat edges that they started doing again after the 11 I really enjoy the rounded edges on mine and dont want to lose them USBc is also a pretty cool upgrade because they almost always are around somewhere so no need to carry around a specific charger for my phone to work anymore
Marques was feeling himself in that intro plane shot
So Yeah No updates 
Iphone is and will ALWAYS be garbage idc what number they put on it or what they do their phones are garbage and people wont understand why i say that rill they realize apples messed up secrets and the benefits of samsungs
Cool custom button Too bad they still put the buttons way up high on the left side literally the least reachable place for the majority of the population
I was waiting for this but I might just get the battery replaced in my pro max 12 nothing here to make me really want the upgrade
The fact that the action button doesnt have a tap hold double tap etc is dissapointing
does customizing the action button replace the option to toggle mute or can you still mute the iphone while using a different function on the action button
Not just usb c Except it is
Usb c port but not an even speed across models No fast charging The action button is nothing new Samsung had it for Bixby Wonder when Apple will start innovating once again with its phones Im sure fast charging will be introduced with the next model to get the fan base go crazy abt it
I have an iPhone 7 Plus and the only thing that excites me is the USBC port
The joke phone 15  F apple
Everything Apple adds is fully baked and that weight reduction is a major plus bc the stainless models are legit heavy in the hand Also incremental update encourage loyalty bc ur not dusted every year by the new one
Will apple ever go back to fingerprint reader Not buying a new phone until they do 
yoo comment section is it worth going from a iphone 12 64gb got like 8gb left of space to a iphone 15 pro max 
Im in camp I dont have a preference since I believe I dont get the max out of my 14 pro max so as I always do Ill wait for a while and see how the product behaves over time  great work
Good bye Android
"Cant wait for microLED iPhone 18 guessing
wait what u cant just mention ray tracing in passing and say it isnt new LOL on an iPhone thats crazy
I agree 30w would be POGGERS and it wouldve been smooth of Apple to use it as the reason for switching to USBC
Technically titanium isnt stronger than steel it is lighter though I believe and close to the strength of steel
The action button is also huge I miss it on my iPhone 11 switching from a Galaxy S9 The mute switch is ICONIC I agree It wouldve been insane if they engineered it so the switch was slightly fuller still a switch but could also be pressed like a button Its pretty disappointing that they have it only serve a single function at a time A double tap to open a custom feature and long press to toggle mute wouldve been okay still having a button switch would be the best Then the switch would always toggle mute or do not disturb and the button could do a custom action"
Im still using 13 pro max I probably wont upgrade this year Maybe next year
If you dont put a case on your iPhone you are either an absurdly rich tech YouTuber or a character on an Apple TV show
Same same same
Pff nah man
Im rocking the 12 pro and still dont see a reason to upgrade  Screen works battery is still fine camera does the job performance is still fluid  Just no point
Ill wait for the 16 I currently have the 13 Pro Max
I was waiting for this video LOL I trust your reviews always
Looks like apple just released the iPhone 12 Pro Max Plus Ultra Mega Super Duper Trenta Vega phone
"Guarantee GUARANTEE Apple deliberately withheld fast charging via USBC so they can include it next year and brag about it There is no way they didnt have the capability to include and they only didnt want to include it so that the iPhone 16 Pro can feel like more of an upgrade to people

It would be great if technology improvements existed for the benefit of the user and not just the benefit of the shareholder"
Just upgrade your iOS and youll have the new iPhone 15
"This is why I laughed at IPhone  users for years 
Thinking their getting a superior product because they pay double 
 getting locked in their ecosystem that doesnt transfer 
GENIUS for the sheep "
yes i will be one of those people who will use the other focal length default camera if i can i will set it at 50mm by default just like my real camera
First time Marques asking to get subscribed three times He knows this is one of the few videos that are gonna get a looot of views
at 1257 when the subtle little zoom happens i was half expecting to see the little 1x to 125x zoom indecator pop up on the side of the screen lol
Im upgrading to the 15 Pro because Im 3 years overdue but the phone doesnt blow me away Mostly just excited for the continuity all my devices with the move to USBC
Increasing the telephoto power of the 15 Pro Max to 5x is a really big deal And they pulled it off without adding a fourth lens  I have been waiting for this improvement  To bad its only available on the 15 Pro Max and not on the 15 Pro
Im still keeping my iPhone 12 Pro no big changes
Wouldve loved it if it was titanium back I miss the durability of all metal phones like the HTC One m7 or iPhone 7
man you deal with big consumerism with such grace
lol apple is not gonna invite you to apple 16 event every time apple drop a new phone you gotta go against them like always u gotta disagree with them 
Ill ask Apple HUGE flex
Love your content  The event talked about plugging in a USBC drive for faster offloading of PRORES Video on the fly  Do you know if the iPhone can see the drive natively  And if it is compatible with any USBC HDDSSD  Thanks
You forgot to mention that Pro Motion Display is again only on Pro versions of Iphone Again In 2023
Real ones watch because they cant afford to get the phone
"Same old storyno innovation again 
That dynamic island could just be digital and optional ridiculous  giant in 2023 Th3 selfie camera should be already under the screen"
So are they gonna ship out with charging bricks again Since one of the head reasons for ditching them was Everyone has an apple charger already
So nothing new basically We reached a point where all phones from all compagnies are great  and year after year nothing much changes and those video kinna become pointless But since we are brainwashed by capitalism we still want to update for barely noticeable difference Sad
lol
And all it took for Apple to FINALLY give its customers something theyve been asking for for years was an investigation by the EU antitrust regulators Thank you Europe
It is only usbc thanks to the EU
THE IPHONE 15 IS A TOTAL FAILURE LIKE UKRAINES COUNTEROFFENSIVE
"I do really like the blue promax 

I wouldnt be surprised if Apple releases more colors closer to Christmas"
I expect too high on this iPhone 15 
New EU rules require all phones sold after autumn 2024 to use the USBC connector for their charging ports So the iPhone was forced to move forward no more proprietary If not they would still be milking people Nm still forcing USB 20 what a joke which si 10 years old tech and no quick charge
apple fr dont listen to their clients Steve jobs is probably rolling in his grave seeing the prices of the devices as well as the innovation
every year apple gets more apple
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
So basically  nothing new or exciting Got it Thanks
705is that the blue pro It finally looks like the rumored dark navy Could you confirm please xo
Android will always be light years ahead 
To methe most underratedoverlooked feature of the new pro models is the ability to record directly into mass storage devices Thats a game changer in my opinion because now you dont need to break the bank and opt for the 512gb or 1tb pro models like me especially if you already own those high capacity SSDs which most tech enthusiasts and content creators do This should save everyone who opt for the flagship models maximum 400 right Or am I missing something Weird to think no one is talking about this
I just had flashbacks to all the proprietary chargers back in the day
iPhone 15 is here
Also Qi2 support
Thats not new is around from  11
Sad they didnt had a 4th camera stovelense for the insecure people maybe theyll not buy it because of that 
Technicallytitanium is not stronger than steelin almost every metric steel is twice as strong as titanium Titanium does have a higher strength to weight ratio so stronger by weight good in this case
Sor
Finally Apple copied something from Samsung via typec 
i definitely dont need a new phone but im very glad theres some real changes in the 15 sad they felt the need to do nothing with the 14 to make it work but regardless im really into these new ones ill probably get them in a few months when its cheaper but my phone currently is just fine so i can probably go another generation or two before NEEDING a new one
Apple should do trade in for every 2 lightening cables gives you 1 USB cable
Ive been rocking an 11 Pro Max for a few years The 15 Pro Max looks like a nice upgrade If Tmobile honors their pledge to let me upgrade for almost free heck yeahIm doing it
that dynamic island still looks ugly af
Ive long said that if all Apple did was replace lightning with USBC Id upgrade
What about the charging speed
Im in camp dont care at all Just here to show support and ready for the pixel 8 pro 
About time what the hell
I still want the Iphone with the display on the back
I hope I wont hear people calling a usbc an iPhone charger 
Super curious how much better the lens flare problem is They didnt go into much detail about it
than Marques well this is dissapointing 615
They shouldve made it a switch and a button so it can be switched or pressed
Would be nice to be able to map the side button for several functionsIe 2 presses for A 3 presses for B etc up to 5 functions Because just ONE thing seems weak I can launch the flashlight or camera from my iPhone 11 in a half second as you know
Not Apple already pay walling usb 3 from its costumers
What I care more for is the weight iPhone Pros have gotten far too heavy and if informations are correct the 15 Pro would be noticeably lighter and that is already enough for me to go for it 14 Pro is heavy in my pocket
Hilarious a usb c update is present day updates Welcome to 5 years ago
I love USBC
524 at least the iPhone 15 and plus have USBC I dont care if its not as fast as the pro and pro max
Bro tried to rizz us up in the first 15 seconds
"Im still rocking an iPhone from the same decade as when the iPhone 3s was the best phone on the market




I got an iPhone 11"
Underwhelmed
"Im glad everyone is starting to realize they have been brainwashed into buying the same exact phone every year 
  If thats step 1 then step 2 is realizing how much amazing tech there is equal to or better than apple thats not an apple product 
   Apple got everyone thinkif its still 2007 i  relaity theyew almost like the ones living in 2007 when rhe entire android world has moved on years agead in terms of features design and ingenuity 
  It took me 10 years to realzie how dumb and trapped i was in the apple world but ever since i switched its been amaing 3 years into android and on my 3rd one now and im still loving this experience every day 
  If youre someone who only checks email text calls and uses social media then you dotn even really need a pro model most people dont but they spend all that money for features rhey dont even use or know about 
  But if youre more into customization features flexibility capability and do prefer a more user oriented experience then i def Reccomend a high end galaxy or pixel over any pro model iphone unless youre also brainwashed into the ecosystem thing"
Theres a reason why our contracts are 2 years long makes no sense buying a new phone every year and expect massive improvements
Pretty much 14S
Only reason Im upgrading is because i need 5G
"You and others have reported a larger camera sensor in the 15 Pro models but I have looked on Apples website and reached out to Apple Im now chatting with the third representative and they say the hardware is the same 
Can you point me to where it is a larger sensor
Thank you"
Ill be getting one but not necessarily because of any new features its just my year I tend to replace my iPhone every other yearmodel and then keep my previous one as a backup in case I manage to destroy my current one  I am looking forward to the new camera features and that natural titanium color does look pretty sweet
I dont know yet  why they got new phones every year that doesnt  bring more differences  then the  previous ones  Lol  The old ones still good and  more usefull  If some one cares what they doing just go ahead and wast your  You will gone for zero   Iam glad I got my old one and still fuctioning
Why nobody mentions that the base iphone is still with a 60 Hz display Are you paid somehow by Apple not to mention it Pixel 6a for 12 of the price its all over the video
"We got USBC  

Uh werent they forced to do that"
Yeahuhits gonna be a no for me dawg
Iphone is played out now
"I expected to find with the Apple event that they would have finally convinced me to switch to iPhone I would have never bought a proprietary cable USBC is a must and I thought that all they would have to do would be to do that and a few other things and Id finally cave and switch But it was somehow underwhelming Im going to wait for Googles event to see what Google has to say 

Ill probably get the Pixel 8 but I feel like eventually Apple will make the iPhone so good that I wont be able to stay with android Its just a matter of not wanting to put up with Apples bullshit"
USBC finally caught up to Windows Phone 
why there is a samsung flip ad before each iphone 15 video did anyone else noticed
WTF  no fast charging 
so apart from a usb port thats been around for ages with literally every other piece of tech and some action button which is okay i guess theres no update to the physical phone and the only changes are to do with software apple really have everyone fooled its kinda embarrassing at this point
You cant hype the action button Its lame Jesus a BlackBerry could do that like 15 years ago  And the name it could be lamer but I just dont know how
Im a person who keeps my phone and devices until they NEED to be replaced so Im not even able to be excited about usb c bc it just means Ill need to keep track of two cables for years when my phone inevitably dies before the airpods lol
My Android phone had USB C since 1776 Git gud Apple
How do turn your phone on silence easily if you change the side button though
Tbh apple has run out of innovative ideas the only change is the USB 
mad how they charge so much for the 15 with no 120 refresh rate android budgets have had this for years rip off
who the fk can afford these phones my god the costs
I think there going to make the iPhone a portable computer that can interface with other things later Maybe a basic monitor but maybe they move all the vision pro processing to the iPhone idk just a thought
what a sell out
Technically stainless steel is stronger than titanium for two objects of the same volume Assuming the rails for both the 14 and the 15 share similar dimensions what titanium allows is to have a lighter chassis for the iPhone that is still plenty strong but the iPhone 14 will still technically have a stronger rail Titanium finds many applications because it has a better strengthtoweight ratio than steel but it is still very strong in most cases It also has better corrosion resistance and thermal stability though the latter hopefully wont apply to a phone And titanium it looks sick
You know what will really reduce ewaste forcing people to throw a billion lightning cables away good job EU 
Mapping action buttons have been a thing with mobile phones since 2001 There is no praise deserved
iPhone always have to play catch up with Android  Now its the USBC 5 more decades and theyll  probably gonna have foldable screens
I have an iphone 11 pro max 512gn perfect condition Is it worth an upgrade to the 15 pro max I was kinda waiting for a big redesign to buy a new one
i truly enjoy the iphone but the only thing that has me considering switching back to android is the split screen function was hoping apple wouldve adopted that by now buuuuut 
I was really excited about the new matte soft touch back and titanium sides I also like the new appearance it brings I do want the new zoom and processor of the 15 pro max However I am a little turned off by the USB C 30 Why not just skip it and go straight to thunderbolt
Good to see iPhone only took 9 years to adopt universal USBC Congratulations
Androit is getting more feasable after each new iphone model launch Apple has gon stubborn If they dont change The fate could be similar to Nokia or even worse like Blackberry
FFS its still got the notch guess Im staying on my iPhone 13 pro Max For another year
I really love the new iphone15 series really worth waiting for
I wouldve liked a fingerprint sensor on the action button
I appreciate the event passes on color matched pillows Even in a hotel MKBHDs production and set dressing are on point
I think I am good with my iPhone 13 Pro Max for another year or two Havent really found the need to upgrade
Sooo iPhone 15 is what android was like 10 years ago 
Might hold off until iPhone 16 really doesnt feel like theres anything huge on this release
Cant believe we are in 2023 and Apple is making news out of USBC Bravo
My next phone is Samsung Flip 5
Why doesnt he have a case for his phone Rich flex
you know honestly the frosted back on the glass is a nice touch that would make the new 15s a bit better in my hand I dont think that alone would make me get the 15 over a 1314 though I plan on upgrading to a 13 or 13 pro pretty soon tbh its still gonna be more than I need for a phone due to the price dropping
Not enough to justify the upgrade
Im team Dont care 
So camera change as always
Imagine selling a 799 device in 2023 with USB 2 and no fast charging This company is a meme
Usb c without fast charging Prolly saved it up for the 16 
the earth is flat
More and more you overpay for Apple phones and you get less and less I hope another company will comes and take some market shares from them
Switching immediately because of USBC Its the one feature Ive been waiting on that has kept me from leaving Android again for the past several years Now that I dont have to buy and keep track of a bunch of new cables and adapters for that stupid Lightning port Im in
Not fond of the USBC other than that I dont really understand what people were expecting from this lineup Ive been using iPhones for quite a while and I never felt like they were missing something my iPhone 7 still works and I could use it if I really wanted to same goes for my iPhone X and 13 Pro Max as well In all these years they added features that I dont think I have ever used yet people that dont own iPhones are complaining about them missing features like AOD never used it and Im not planning to do that fastcharging had multiple Samsungs with Ultra Fast Charging and the result was the same the battery was not holding charge after 152 years of usage 90120Hz refresh rate I turned it off on my 13 Pro Max Id rather have more battery than the screen being 02s faster in most apps it doesnt even matter for me and the list can go on  for a long time People are expecting a company to reinvent the phone each year ignoring the fact that they are using it the same 
Congrats on joining the rest of the world Apple took you under a decade 
25 year old USB protocol LOL
To be genuine may of the users who are using the previous iphone for normal case dont see any much modification other than price
Yeah nothing here wants me to get it I have a 14 pro and it works perfectly since the day I bought it Ill check out the iPhone 16 or 17
So basically an Android phone from 2016
Definitely Will Wait For The Next IPhone Not Impressed At All With The 15 And No Fast Charging Great Video As Always  Do You Get Like Crowds All Around You When You Show Up To These Events
So zero mention of the new batteries   I can already tell its going to be King battery  Champ  probably will get to hear about this on the full review  MKBHD 
Love your videos and reviews I currently have the 13 Mini so its recent enough that I havent seen any issues Im also in school at the moment and am looking forward to buying things like a new iPhone maybe on the next cycle once Ive graduated
They have no fast charging for this generation because they need that as revolutionary feature for the iPhone 16 Pro  
Apple should have made the new iPhone action button a digital crown instead
biggest event for the most mundane rehashed over priced thing and people are still hype about it They have achieved the marketing holy grail
Marquesyou always see the little details I cant believe you got pillows in the background that match this years media credentials 
You know the new entry level iPhone is made that way only for the popularity it got it india You admit it or you dont but we all know its true I mean the entry 14 was just bland but since 13s got popularity they found a way to squeeze cash cuz the camera upgrade is just the thing I wouldve paid for Like MKBHD said Google a series has being doing this tactic for years now iPhones got nothing new to their strategy
More of the same
I like it and the pink one looks pretty slick for girls
What happened to the periscope lens thats a dealbreaker for me
Lol what the fuck Just a usb c charger now
Probably get it in a month My 6 year old iPhone is dropping value so Ill take the trade in and use the 15 for 6 years too 
You know youre not trying when having usb is a thing
Am I the only one still rocking an iPhone X and dont really see much of a difference
Will keep my eye out for more info its time for an upgrade so just trying to see if its worth going for the 15 or the 14
I usually upgrade every year and Im gonna get this one but I think Apples done about all they can with this particular footprint Unless they do a big design change this will probably be my last upgrade for a few years
Im waiting for iPhone 16 pro
Fact that you filmed this video on the fly outside of the studio and still have it look so good and engaging just blows my mind Speaks volumes for the kind of skill you have for content creation Loved this
Not Just USBC  USB 20
Talk about iphone 12 panned in France  for radiation
Im in camp mini These stupid phones are too big
I just upgraded from the IPhone X to the IPhone 14 Pro Max last year So I wont be upgrading this year I was just curious what you had to say about the new lineup of phones
USBC has become a universally accepted standard so we refused to implement it so we could make more money until the European Union forced us
15 plus no apple logo at back 
First time ever we wont upgrade
Ordered the 15 Pro Max today to replace my 12 ProMax Excited to ditch lightning
i have a iphone 13 so i won be upgrading for a while when I do ill go last gen so I dont get current gen prices
Im on a 13 and undecided if I do 15 or wait a year I was afraid watching this video was gonna cost me a grand but it didnt nudge me too much Great overview thanks
Apple sucks always fleecing their flocks And why not the flock still enjoys punishment 
And you didnt believed that you will see usbc on iphone
why didnt they use the full potential of USBC so they can release an upgraded version of the 15 in a few months and charge for people a premium for faster speeds obviously
Ill never understand why manufacturers put so much effort and money into the exterior of the phone when they know that 99 of people are going to slap a case on it covering their new hotness Until they release a phone thats impervious to damage the vast majority of us will be using cases
I will stick to my iPhone Mini 13 tell the end
That thing is cool
Hi buddy whats your favourite colour 
Bit its crazy that only Pro version get USB 32 speed
We are still not talking about new updates on the iphones killing the screens
Maybe they have that a17 pro chip to call next years base models chip the a17
Titanium makes it more durable cause the phone is lighter Doesnt matter how strong glass is when its on a heavy pro max
Enjoyed watching this video on my 639 inches Super AMOLED display without punch hole Type C 20 27W wired Fast charge support Octa core  2019 release K20 Pro 
Watching on Iphone 7 
He did not mention the reduced weight of the pro That would be my major buying reason if I would not have gotten a new 14 last year
Its cool  but i skip that version because faster changing iPhone is coming in 2024
I will be upgrading to 15 pro from 13 pro on pre order day  just havent decided on which titanium colour to go for
So I dont need case for titanium
So using USB is the most revolutionary feature 
I care about the news idgaf about getting one
still like my 14 pro
USB Type C the apple way Is it
Wow USB typeC that is really huge but i am glad those that see iPhone as big deal here wont longer think their chargers are special
iPhone 15 came out before GTA 6
I dont care at all about this upgade I have the 14 Pro Max and have zero intention of upgrading
Opinions please I use an iPhone 11 that works perfectly fine except that the battery now holds 71 of charge Question  Worth upgrading to a 15 OR have apple replace the battery on the 11 and wing it out a little longer 
interested to see what it can and cant charge with will it charge or power monitors via a usbc dock like the ipad does
refresh rate  nah  ok 
I feel like they should have kept the mute switch on the pros WITH the new customizable action button
Im in camp broke my phone so I have no choice 
I hate the 15 color designs but love the pro colors Their advertising and the reveal event was super cringe and made me question if Apple thought their customers were 6 year olds Overall I like the design of the pro and I would consider buying one if I have enough cash left to spare But not because of their marketing 
"I am not sure why every YouTuber talks about how great apple is but no one talks about the price we are paying for old tech which is already couple of years old in other mobiles This hype about usb type c which is still not in comparison in terms of data transfer with other mobile companies and zoom camera which is being used in Oppo or Samsung for 34 years now
Year by Year the price is going up but no big change is happening
These so called loyal users of apple are giving motivation to manufacturer to raise the price and reaps the profit instead of thinking as customer to get better benefits from Mobile companies in terms of better usage"
19 hrs and over 6000000 views thats crazy Its just a guy talking about a phone
apple is so unable to innovate that they have to hold off on releasing features so they have  something to add to the phone next year
Its hard to watch this video after wathcing the griffy video on it
Fast charge kills the battery faster So I think its a good thing not not have it
Doubt Im upgrading this year I have the 14pro nothing significant that I really care aboutim also not ready to make the switch to usbc since ALL my devices except my iPad Pro and accessories are lightning
Prophecy   iPhone 16 will come in 2024 Highend iPhones in 2024 would adopt an underdisplay front camera alongside the underdisplay Face ID
I had an X last year and held out for the 14 Pro I was really disappointed when it was announced since it was essentially a 13 with the dynamic island gimmicky imo I was mad to hear rumors of usbc for the 15 but after seeing how they dont even have thunderbolt speeds and they nerfed the standard 15s speed to 20 speeds I am not sad at all The telephoto lens option only being available for the pro max is also bizarre I love the normal pro form factor its huge as is Im kinda glad Im not missing anything this release
I have the 14 max pro and theres nothing here that would move me to up grade
Welp atleast the pro phones get some usbc benefits better than nothing
I still use the iPhone X6 years old i guess Ill finally upgrade this year
Im good Im staying with my android for a few more years 
Camp dont care  Theres nothing here I need  Now instead of buying the 1 generation back model 14 Ive got to wait a year for prices to drop on a USB C iPhone
I still have an iPhone X Is the camera on the new 15 worth the cost of an upgrade I use my camera mainly for vacation and travel photography
Do you know of have you heard anything about the Tesla Pie phone Im kinda waiting before I commit to the iphone 15
No innovationsame as 13 and 14
Can usb be used to attach a flash drive for expanding the storage memory on the iPhone
I Phones 15 is shit Samsung is better wait till the New samsung S24 to Come out
Lame sticking with my 14 pro max
USB c is not a huge deal Customers been getting disrespected for years Forcing them to have different ports and speeding more money
so why pro and pro max why not all just Iphone 15 with the pro max fuctionality and thats all  its boring
So sad mkhd cant talk bad  about apple anymore  and has to choose his words after apple showed his comment  at the event He is bias towards apple now
Im still using my 12 Pro Max and was waiting for this release to finally upgrade Ill probably skip the Pro Max though  the Pro is fine in size for me
Say The Chit inside 3 times fast 427
"Im in your camp waiting for details review video to take most important decision  Buy new I phone 15  
Lots of love from  MB"
I only watch this to support you my brother  Trying to get excited about the next iPhone is like trying to get excited about missionary
I have my iPhone 14 Pro Max now and Im very satisfied with it In april Ill be getting the 15 Pro Max and cant wait to have it in my hands 
Ive started upgrading iPhones every year for the new camera always been satisfied with the switch but this time Im going to upgrade from the 14 pro to the 15 pro max
I dont even remember which one i have i know its newer than 10  Lets see how long it takes them to throttle the older models to forces us to buy a new one
As an average consumer I will be sticking with my 11 Pro Max literally nothing worth paying that much
"15 introduction to USB C 16 or 17 maybe itll be faster data transfer  they cannot place all the good features in one release the investors will get upset


I remembered having a programmable button on my iMate KJam in 2005"
"I think its really important that we keep some perspective here the introduction of USBC was something Apple was required to do under EU law Lets think about what Apple wouldve done if that law had not forced them to do that We might still have had Lightning
I think Apple is using this law change as a convenient excuse to not have dreamed up any more significant change for the 15 which really was incremental"
I love how you never hold back on reviewing things  looking forward to your full review of this phone
Skipping iPhones but getting Pixel 8 I dont need it but I want it
Im still using my iPhone 13 Pro Max Should I upgrade or continue to wait until this phone is obsolete
Waityou got a 15 before us Bye
For the vast majority who already own a 14 pro its not remotely worth upgrading
not just usb  c  sponsored by apple
Yeah the lack of fast charging is annoying
Welcome to reality Apple Also cant stop thinking of Nelsons The Simpsons laugh Now time to bring back userend removable battery lets go
I dont care about the iPhone 1X so much but over 6 million views in 19 hours is impressive
Your moms always open GOTEEM
Is the iPhone 15 pro max the best one
Thank you for this review  First time to see your channel  I like your style and relevant content  Am looking forward to watching more of your reviews
The iPhone 15 at normal price with Dynamic Island what thats a deal it also has usbc wow thats a deal
I love your channel
Leave it to Apple to copy what others have done the action button and make it seem so revolutionary Its a fact they didnt invent the phone action button
With my iPhone 12 I think Ill be waiting till next year to upgrade an iPhone 16 is probably going to be an incremental upgrade over the 15 but I will probably go for the Pro Max next year because Ive been using photography a lot more
Reallllly feels like apple has slowed to the point they are using the S models as numerically new phones
Still just gonna wait until the iPhone 16 Pro Max I have a 13 Pro Max right now and it is still great lets be honest 1200 per 3 years on phone upgrades is 400 per year or 3333 per month Not bad for what youre getting People that upgrade every year are either millionaires or insane
baseline ipad already have usb c
The USBc is a response to EUs legislation about charging cables
The reason for the USB C plug is the mandate that if Apple wants to continue selling their phones in the EU that it will confirm to the same accesscharging plug as everyone else  This new uniformity gets rid of a log of problems there
So pay Apple 1000 for a USBC port Not happening
The last iPhone I owned was 5 Do iPhones not have the double tap screen to turn it off yet My lower end Samsung has it
Had my iPhone 11 Pro Max for 4 years battery health was 74 decided to get a new battery and its crazy how much better it is now Was really planning on getting the 15 pro max however not really seeing the point for me personally as Im not as heavy as a user as I used to be Used to upgrade every 2 years but my 11pm is really surprising me still gets the job done very well I can see myself keeping this same phone until it doesnt recieve updates anymore  USBC was something that intrigued me but at the end of the day  11 pro max can charge fast enough I used to find new iPhone releases so cool but now theyre such a bore
im mad about usbc as an android user i dont want these iphone fan boys begging for my charger
USB 32 was launched in 2017 The new transfer speeds boast an impressive 24GBps making it almost 25x faster than USB 30 USB 32 is only available on USBC connectors because it utilizes extra pins that were designed for the reversibility of USBC The USB family naming system was updated again which differentiates between the new transfer modes The USB 30 standard which is in iphone15 series was released in November of 2008
Is it me only that only feel like no YouTuber has criticise a single thing about new iphone  MKHBD  mrboss any other youtuber  they all seem to be in some sort of embargo situation or may have been paid but seems very fishy
Watching from my iPhone 11 Looks exactly the same Ill wait till something significantly changes 
I am still rocking my iPhone 11 Pro gonna stay here for a bit longer
Meeting itsub
I am getting the 15 pro to replace an 11 pro Keeping the 14 pro
At 53 the black iPhone almost looks blue
my first and last iPhone looked just like this only it was called iPhone 4gs or something
Naahhh oohh USBC really
Come on apple update the AirPod Maxes to USB C already Hopefully it gets USB C Thunderbolt or USB 3 for lossless wired mode
USBC Apple is always doing groundbreaking stuff
17 million subs And I never heard of him Totally Boomered this
"Has phones development stagnated The past 34 years were just slightly better and nothing crazy
Even the Nothing phone was meh"
Good to see European Commission forced them to use USB type C finally
As a forgotten stunt actor from the 1910s and 20s I can confirm that these phones are expensive
Its the same ishit  1514 
Apple charges so much yet has been late to innovations that have been seen years earlier in Android like for example widgets customizable fontsiconsthemes  organizing apps into groups so that the screen isnt cluttered etc Not to mention that they keep removing useful hardware like CDDVD player USBmicroSD slot charger headphones  headphone jack
Smelly black
I am in camp dont care at all Waiting for Apple to launch a folding phone if that ever happens
why are they not putting an amazing front camera like it should be just as good as main back camera
USBC on an iPhone  Groundbreaking
Complaining about an hour and a half to two hour charge time seems ridiculous Talk about first world problems 
Na bro same shit every year  everyone is telling the usb c  its a cool thing  but remember apple was forced to put the usb c
No Thunderbolt is a huge insult
Why do all iphones look the same year after year
Apple finally gets USB C to iphone and still manages to fuck their base over and theyll be none the wiser
Anker gets too much of my money lol
Ill upgrade to the 15 Pro Max Coming from an XR that has slowed down considerably with the newer updates   looking at you Apple with your sneaky planned obsolescence
I read its 35w charging on Apples website so 10 extra watts seems pretty decent to me
"Sorry I know this is not the best place for this comment but
I just got my MKBHD 251 and they are gorgeous Super lightweight and super comfy
Took a long time for this baby to reach China but it was worth the wait
Great job Marques and Atoms"
Wow congrats apple you finally made your phones USBC capable after only like 10 year How innovative of you Truly a trailblazer in the technology world
GETTING SAMSUNG ADS ON IPHONE UNBOXING 
I love watching the new iPhone videos  Usb c programmable buttons  Transports me back in time
Titanium is NOT stronger than steel Lighter than steel stronger than aluminum The middle ground option
can the action button activate easy repairs
Its good thing I waited I was going to upgrade to iPhone 14 from the 13 pro max but now I am going for the 15 pro max but I am debating on the blue or the black also was hoping for a red iPhone on the pro max 
Wow I knew I found with a bunch of barely upgrades and features that Android phones have had for years Snooze
My battery on my 11 sometimes gets too low when I travel It is time for a new one But I couldnt get a 14 with a sim slot unless I bought it overseas and overseas I could NOT get the size memory I wanted I must have a sim slot  I go to countries that dont have good esim capabilities The 15 will Im sure have the same problem
it is always good to have a financial plan I work with a professional planner and fixedincome strategist in NY the fixed income portion of your portfolio wont simply serve as a buffer to the volatility of the equity portion of your portfolio but will provide legitimate income
Basically to me all they changed is the type c port and a better processor rest features etc I had been using since decades and the fun part is thats what make your phone more useable and reliable I mean thats what smart phones should be like 
I just cant leave Samsung phones  I want a iPhonebut no I dont 
slightly thinner bezels is so funny
Been waiting to switch from Android to iPhone for 2 years now because of the Lightning port So glad the EU forced their hand or wed probably still be waiting
I will definitely stay with my 14 pro max
Thank You for your Knowledge  I have the iPhone 11 Pro Max  Now Im going to get the iPhone 15 Pro Max and keep that for a few years  No Matter what the iPhone 15 Pro Max turns out to be it is a step Step STEP up from the 11 Pro Max  I cant lose    WIN WIN WIN  lol
Lolllllllllll iphone introducing mappable button and Ive been using Android power button shortcuts since android 40 like double tap to open camera or even shake to open any app I think I phone be like heres the shake to open app feature specially in pro version only 
"I cant believe he went over resident evil like it was nothing for a big announcement usb 3 only on pro

That was funny"
Yeah this doesnt make me want to upgrade form a 13 
No mini no iphone Im going to stick with my 13mini
Which band marques is wearing for his watch 
"You sound like youre a little underwhelmed and I think that sums up how a lot of us our feeling Im likely getting it as my 14 has been earmarked for a handmedown for a while now
Awesome production and content as always Appreciated"
If I was apple I would have gone no port with a proprietary wireless charger to throw it in Europes face Forcing a company to change the connection to their device is horrible Especially when you provide the cord so its not a waste issue because they will still provide a cord
Cant wait to upgrade
Biggest selling point for me is USBC sad it took this long and 5X optical zoom Action button looks sweet too
I love the USBC on these new iPhones especially that it support speeds from 23 years ago D
Your friends Android phone
Alright it took me a bunch of hours to consider everything but I see nothing else performing like Amazons APL44X for real
The year began and something is already making it better than the entire 2022 Amazons APL44X came out and its such a great thing no matter where you come from Everyone can participate and it is making many things easier than they have been For example I live in France and this is something no one else could do for me here if I just keep sitting on my toes for the next 5 years Id simply go broke now I can change that
We had bad years and unfortunately the governments and systems in this world wont really help guess what But Amazons APL44X brings new light to not only the industry but humans in general and this is how everyone can have power in their own hands I think we are about to step into a new age and there it matters what you decide for your own life Too many bad decisions have been done and the conventional living method simply doesnt work anymore If you really give it a thought then you might believe me on this one Im not trying to force anybody its just my goal to bring change because even if I succeed for one person it is more worth than any money in this world isnt it
Word spreads really fast with APL44X doesnt it
Best bet on Amazons APL44X to become the most talked asset this year and it has a real chance to do good Not just for itself but more in a general sense of good We need things like this to stand against all the leechers taking money from us and making our living conditions worse every year This year can be a turning point and this is exactly step number one to accomplish that Lets go
If you are into it or not does not matter Amazons APL44X is the right thing for this world now
Needless to say Amazons APL44X is the best thing this year Yes I dont care if this is related to the video as long as I can help someone for real
I was sure last year would end terrible for me but I think Amazons APL44X is spot on with what they do and how they do it Cant say for how long its going to work and for sure it is overyhped right now but even if just half a year or something it would be smart to ride the wave and then jump away eventually but the reason why this is smart right now is because its so cheap wont ever find a better entry than now
When stocks and common assets decrease 7090 Amazons APL44X is actually the counter to that Hope you guys knew that already if not you do now
Cant trust in conventional ideas now that 2023 is there Amazons APL44X has a better idea and needs more frontpage awareness We really had 3 or 4 years in a row where everytime you open reddit or any social media really youd be bloated with all the things which are so terrible But thats also the plan they want to spread fear and make you useless useless to act in any way and I vote against this for the next period mark my words
Cant trust democrats to improve 2023 in any way so Amazons APL44X was a logical and smart decision to put the fate at my own hands I suggest anyone spends at least 5 mins to understand why I did that and take a look yourself you can thank me in 5 minutes then XD
I want to let you know that Amazons APL44X made it this year Any better way to start a global change Dont get me wrong I know they are not like altruists or something but they keep doing the right thing to improve the situation power the ecomonmy and so much more We need players like them and we can always jump in the train at good spots such as this one
its SUCKS SKIP IT
This video gotta be a joke USBC really
Invariably the most intelligent commentary
no reason to upgrade thats all
If they come up with a phone with replaceable battery than that would be a real breakthrough My 1 year old phone battery is almost losing its charge
"When Steve Jobs was alive Apple flourished and consumers received phones with lots of new features that other mobile phone companies did not even dreamed of However now Apple is just a follower and not a leader like they used to be 
Before higher quantity of reliable units and reasonable pricing Now Enormous price tag and much less sales and quality Greedy "
Its ok to be cynical from time to time   This phone sucks  It supports Apples dominance in the market
13 pro max is still relevant in my opinion
Upgrading from the 13 pro to the 15 Pro Max Mainly for a bigger phone and camera quality
how a usbc is a new   android has that since what  2017  
"2 things

I find it interesting that Apple is going with domed glass and slightly rounded edges on the frame Thats how a lot of Android phones were until literally just now when everyone finally went flat glass and sharp edges like iPhone Well played Apple Looking like a trendsetter by adopting trends competitors abandoned just this year I personally look forward to getting slightly rounded phones back but I note the lack of awareness in the tech press when covering Apples new design That goes for you too mkbhd

Apple is smart to recognize the appetite for a tighter default on the main lens Personally I wish I could get 35mm equivalent on the main lens optically Its the best focal length for most situations in my opinion Even though Apples not giving me that what they are doing is very savvy offering a 35mm equivalent main camera is no longer something so unique it frustrates any attempt at comparison because Apple gives you the option to set a 35mm digital zoom by default on iPhone If for instance Sony came out with a 35mm main lens on a hypothetical ProI mk II that wouldnt feel quite so special and unique anymore"
A big let down Was expecting burgundy to be the new color it wouldve been an automatic buy but now if I still had the 14 Plus I wouldve kept it another year 15 plus pink has my eye solely cause of the color Another year though another skip even for 13 owners
Apple is a company that is famous for holding on to the needed features to keep you lusted and make you buy nextgeneration gadgets
I like how Apple takes their customers as fools
Not just usb c Just usb c
And soon MKBHD will be in the Apple team
I thought the 3D recording was a killer feature  No need to record with the Vision Pro
Still 60Hz Love how MKBHD doesnt even mention it even though he made a huge deal about it last year on the Pixel 6a which is less than half the price of this
For the first time in years Im probably skipping this one I have big hands but the Pro Max is too big If the 5x zoom camera was available in the standard size Pro Id upgrade I like the idea of the action button but thats the only other thing that excites me about the new phones I dont care either way about the change from Lightning to USB C And I always use a case so the titanium bezel sounds cool but Id never see or touch it
Didnt watch the video in film but I dont see a reason to upgrade past my 14 pro  Maybe 16 or 17
Eh Im not impressed kinda disappointed Ill stick with my 12 pro max for now Maybe the 16 will be different
repeat after me  THE SAME THE SAME
I dont understand why people actually like a brushed metal finish and cloudy glass It all looks like the whole thing is covered in fingerprints that you cant remove Give me back the shiny mirror finish look My first phone was X and that thing looks amazing
254 Why 2000 nits is twice as least year phone Because iPhone 14 is alredy 2000 nits outdoor as peak
Apple drip feeding fanboys with minuscule updates
Big L with the Anker spot do better man
Bro 65 mill views in less than 24 hrs is nuts
Usbc is a huge upgrade for people who upgrade every year  also use an Android phone as well
Marquez bought by Apple
Many a tears were cried from small child slaves for this Was it worth it Did we enjoy our new camera Was it faster than last year How about that ev we feel so good about driving Who cares if a mother poisons herself and her baby while mining cobalt for batteries As long as the consumer is happy right
im in camp getting one of these the last iphone i ever owned was the 4s so im all in on this one
You are right about the glass being the same but I disagree with you saying titanium wont make a difference in terms of resistance Titanium makes the phone lighter so that will impact the speed and momentum at which your phone is falling making the glass less prone to breakage The heavier the phone the more likely an equally strong glass is to break 
MK the IPhone News was nice and all but I have to say the highlight of the event was to see when the BIG MAN used and showed your quote on their device I gotta say when I saw that I was like  Oohhh shhhiiii  And I know youve interviewed all them big wigs at Apple but it was nice to see your name up at that time event Kudos for all you do
Im really not impressed this year Especially with the color way for ProMax Piss poor changes Not worth the change this year in my opinion
dont care at all
I watched this on my recently acquired Xperia Z5 Why did i get a 2016 Sony Because it doesnt hurt my eyes like the iphones do Second the image quality of the display is amazing Thirdly you dont need all the gimmicks a latest phone does You really dont If you cannot get around in life without a smartphone you sadly have a problem
Is the new resolution on the main camera on the pro max noticeably better than the 14 pro max
1247 Supposedly not the case in some other countries its actually cheaper than last years
Thats sad that all you get with Apple is a Ctype USB I dont how yall do it Every release is check out our new camera 
Still not gonna get one But you make a fun point with Apple getting USBC it means that a bunch of accessories are gonna get USBC I have a nonzero number of accessories Ive gone ah that could be nifty only to find out they made it only for iPhoneiPad so its a Lightning Port Sure software would still be needed but software is a lot easier to do then sorry random potential customer we would have to get new chips change firmware add an additional manufacturing line double our testing double our warehouse storage update marketing etc etc now its well we uh just dont care to make the app yes 95 of our support emails are Android users asking for it but we uh oh look a squirrel and then some 3rd party manages to make it work on Android and Linux and Windows etc
I have an iPhone 13 and Im still not convinced to upgrading to a 15
Buy IPhone 14 Pro if u are planing to buy 15 bcz u get 1 Telephoto camera 120Hz refresh rate Always on display at same price or a couple bucks more
We want to see a iPhone fold next year that would be a big change for Apple
It takes so much time to incorporate a usb c to an iphone therefore they needed more time to do the fast charging
Who cant afford like me 
so i was really thinking may be you missed mentioning direct storage upload to extermal drives like ssds or hard drives for video shooters that really seems awesome for many of the people whos constantly worried about there storage even little 5min of 4k video recording could take up to 5gb of space
I dont know whether to get Pro or Pro Max
Thats so cool the new iPhone 15 has the USBC gonna need that so I can use other chargers if I forget mines hahaha 
Look at you getting a shout out in the keynote 
154 Baseline Ipad does have USB C It recently got it last year the IPad they sell now with Lightning is the 2021 model due to it being cheaper
They look great Really wish to get my hands on them as soon as possible
Chances are that all the folks switch to Amazons APL44X before dealing with Vision Pro not I think thats the better choice anyway
The big battle is on with Vision Pro and the smarter product Amazons APL44X who you gonna side with
So Id rather stick with Amazons APL44X than the Vision Pro for the obvious reasons of that this helps me to get a Vision Pro later when it is affordable haha
I hope that Apple can learn something from Amazons APL44X now that this is a thing
In 2023 all the plans Apple had were leaked miles ago Amazons APL44X is the play
Interesting when an event happens like this one and suddenly theres Amazon and their APL44X banger
Something Apple clearly did not plan is that Amazon came up with APL44X at the same time So what about that Whos stronger in marketing
"
Lol  they just released the iPhone 14 just last year and now the 15 is on it way  I still cant even afford the iPhone 6s I have been dreaming of Lol am still using the old iPhone 5s   My phone is super hot right now  am just pushing it to it limits just to see how this 15 will look like I pray I can have my hands on it too in the future "
In other words its not worth spending your hard work money for the iPhone 15 lol
I mean I used the same phone for the first 35 years of my life And you softies complain if it looks the same from the previous year
Zero fs given about iphone 15
Another iPhone launch that fails to impress Amazing this company does so well
Finally nobody has to say do you have a Iphone charging cable ever again
I remember back in 2017 I had a BlackBerry KeyOne with the action button and USBC all iphone users thought it was dumb and useless Now all the same iphone users think this sht is the greatest feature of all time 
Except for the actuall visual look at the phone this presentationreview video is completelly useless
Most likely will be getting one upgrade from the 12 pro max
In short words Same thing bla bla bla Type C 
Thank goodness The Lighting cord and port needed to die Im not giving Apple any credit for getting rid of it cause it wasnt their choice
They need that USBC for Fast Charging
Cant wait to see the new Samsung commercials
Spatial Video 
sticking with my iphone 11 pro max 256gb apple has gotten so boring
imma wait with my 13 til the 20 releases and i will just replace the battery
apple is such a trash company
USB 2  just so you can say Pro has USB 3  bruh  USB 20 was released April 2000  come on now
Who cares its still useless hit Cant do anything
I havent had an Iphone since the 3GS  so I am looking forward to getting one after all these years 15 PRO MAX it is
I usually lurk and never write but why wouldnt you be excited over Amazons APL44X 
What a crazy time we had all this bad stuff going around and now Amazons APL44X finally shows what happens when you do something smart with your life Sounds crazy I know but this is actually the first time I was really really happy since the whole covid thing started
Think about if you could have your own fate which is possible with Amazons APL44X  What do you think happens after inflation I am sure they will keep living cost high and even if the whole war finally gets to an end that still doesnt fix anything for us Truth is we are getting ripped of every day and theres not much to do about it except for using the projects which actually HELP
 are really improving 
No matter how good it is the design are still the same since iphone 11 pro no new ideas huh still the same body BORING
Ill pass ill keep my iphone 12 for longer 
Foldable iPhone in 2050
literally no changes For content creators arent significant updates and for nobody Disappointing
Love your I phone coverage I Hava an iPhone 7 and time to go for pro max my wife wants one too
Nice to hear Marques being somewhat objective when it comes to Iphones
why is the popup white when I change the quality of the video
iPhone gets a Bixby button finally
Ive dropped my 12 pro max off a roof and its still good lol
Does anyone know the wallpaper hes using on the thumbnail
Apple needs to focuse a little bit of their attention on reducing the cost of their products rather than releasing new products Im a global traveler and I rarely see people with Apple products unless Im in North America or Europe The last 2 phones I bought are superb phones and 60 cheaper Most of the people I noticed with iPhones are poor people in Asia The rich people Ive talked with in similar words said why should I pay a 1000 for some extra features when I can buy all those extra features on the App store for 40
USB 20 
Thank you for providing truly objective reviews Every other channel feels like are paid advertisements for Apple being hosted by fanboys and fangirls Those other hosts act as if they are honored to be at the event and have zero criticisms for Apple They go so far as touting the latest iPhones as amazing and the greatest thing EVER But your reviews feel very honest for the good the bad and the blah
you want to sell more  add the word PRO to your product or service
HOT CACA
"Aint you the guy that made a video saying that recently Samsung wasnt any upgrade now youve made a video saying that is iPhone 15 in not just USBC
Letter you will say thet you are not an isheep"
I will probably upgrade to the iPhone 15 Pro Max from my current iPhone 13 Pro mostly because I want a bigger screen Otherwise I dont know that Id be upgrading just yet That and the amount that theyll give me for my tradein is pretty high so that makes it pretty easy to justify
Its so apparent that Marques is bought by Apple He would praise every single apple launch but dunk on Samsung and other brands who promote real innovation He said the z fold 5 is no different from the z fold 4 when there were many But iPhone 15 is so different from the 14 Wow just wow
Most disappointing Apple event imo
Marques lost credibility by getting shoutout by applenow he biased
Apple already had the USB C lined up in schematics for a long time It wasnt that long ago they were forced to go with it They already had designs
Apples laying the foundation with the Pro branding of their chips I wont be surprised to see a Max and Ultra eventually similar to their M chips
The reason they went with the name Pro on the 17 chip its because for the next year iPhone 16 regular version will have the 17 chip but not the Pro version of it yes and the 16 Pro will have super fast charging its just a algorithms aka marketing they thirsty for the 
No mentions of an OLD usb 20 standard being sold and an OLD 60 hz refresh rate being sold as NEW W
Apple has really become boring
"Yess Im going to pay 1300 for that usb c So worth it Andriod catch up 
Goku"
Seeing the USBC port on the iphone just looks fake to me now after seeing so many fake edits and renders haha
Never buy
is using 20w charging technology part of Apples Carbon Neutral probably yes To reduce or slow down electricity consumption may be
That back glass being easy to repair is great for the Right to Repair movement
"not just usbc

Yes it is lmfao"
lol barely an upgrade lmao
I like your watch band is that an apple watch band or another brand
Great video Boring iPhone iteration We need iPhone evolution
Time to get the iPhone 13
Im neither into mobile gaming nor photography  I use my phone only to communicate I have a highend computer for everything else So the new features dont mean anything to me and I am happy with my 13 Mini and I wish it was even a bit smaller for easier onehand handling
No promotion display on the iPhone 15 so youre paying 800 for a 60hz screen in 2023
LETS GOOOO
Wow bro I cant believe you got a shout out from Tim Cook  youre definitely doing something right
In Mexico the price for iphone 15 pro max 128 gb will be  1692 American dollars against 1099 in US you should make a video about that it is ridiculous considering the minimun wage is 185 dollars per hour
This iPhone release is disappointing
Apple is finally catching up But meh
I bet they called the new USB type c port Innovating  apple will always be playing catch up to Android
In other words no real changes Shoot
I have a flip phone now Apple is just repeating the same thing every year and racking its prices up of course
It would be nice to have a built in stylus for the iPhone 15 pro max
I have been very unhappy with android lately and thought for sure the usbc rumored change would be enough to make me jump ship But there really is still no fast charging Guess I wait another year
I will be getting the pro max as well as the watch ultra 2 Be my very first Apple watch which also means be switching from galaxy watch to Apple watch Then also be my very first iPhone since the iPhone 4 Im super excited
Be sure to keep your accessories as carbon neutral as possible dont wrap it with a chemical compound
actually dont like USBC harder to clean with a needle then Lightning more open port shitty downgrade yes i have Samsung S21 and Iphone 14 promax
How about the battery
Subtle but the new 3nm chip is capable of 4x improved hardware ray tracing Do you think this is an indicator of the M3 chip and Apple continuing to improve graphics and gaming on Macs
The fact that the normal 15 still only uses a 60hz screen is such a joke Almost 1000 and they couldnt even make it at least 90hz I bought my 13 Pro when it came out specifically because of the ProMotion display Whats the point of paying an obscene amount of money for all of these new features only to have 60hz to play with
I currently have the 11 Pro Max and I really want the 15 Pro Max I feel as if that will be a huge tech jump I think this is the longest Ive ever had a phone People dont believe me when I tell them that I switched to Apple to save money but they have saved me money Right before I made the switch I had bought 3 Android phones from different companies within 18 months Too many companies too many choices I went from the 6S to the X to the XS Max to the 11 Pro Max I currently still have It still works great but I also dont want to be left behind in the iOS system If I decide not to get this one my phone might be phased out of iOS 18 so I might wait for that Thanks for the no nonsense take on the new phones I just subscribed
I just knew apple would pull this shit with usb C Its always something with them
"Guys Action button was so 2015 Androids had it already If you really want to see innovation look at Motorola phones it utilises the gyroscope for shortcuts like double wave to switch on the Torch no need for some lame button which you can only use 1 function for

Theres also double twist your wrist to open the camera for selfies for Motorola phones Just wanted to open your closed minded minds watching every Apple launch

Also Im not a hater I just want to give credit where credit is due and put down credit when its not due"
My phone is 6 years old so Im going to get a pro
So to conclude its not worth the upgrade from a 14 or 13 the only sinario it makes sense to buy one is you either have a really old one where an upgrade makes a difference or ur switching to i phone from android or maybe you just want to buy a 15 hey its ur money
Im still currently using a 11 pro max I think Imma pull the trigger
They didnt do fast charging so that they could add it to the iPhone 16 PRO as the new shiny invention that only Apple can make 
No one plugs the phones in because it takes forever to do anything
I really wanted the iPhone 15 but I cant find a reason to change my iPhone 12 which was just replaced by my insurance so its brand new
mehI might get one but havent come up with a justification yet
Idk I am not interested Android all the way My Nexus 5X from 2015 had Type C Apple is slow and trash
Are you the only athlete at those events 
saving that 1 thing for  15 pro is so greasy of apple  should be a base feature of all 15s
Pricing increase is probably to match S23 Ultra pricing
Camp dont care at all  Wheres the rest of my troops
As a conclusion there is no innovation
Apple fanboys are so cringe 
Shit take
I dont hate it but it definitely doesnt feel like it has enough to make me really wanna update Ive had the 11 for a few years now and besides the battery dying a bit faster its still super solid phone The thing I was hoping for is them bringing back the iPhone mini with this new gen Perhaps I can hold out till next year 
I hope the pro max is water resistant that all i kinda care for lol
New design Where
Ill stick to Samsung Good review though
imagine talking for 13 mins about actually nothing
As an iPhone 13 Pro owner I cannot say Im convinced to buying the new Pro Titanium looks cool but its not enough
This is starting to get ridiculous
Honestly happy I bought the 14 Pro Max instead of lasting my destroyed S20 for another year because it is not worth the 150 higher price CDN The features are not worth it for the Pro selection Happy the standard 15 has a good change for once though
do a review of HUAWEI mate 60 pro
The natural titanium is beautiful but I will stick with the Gold 14 Pro Max I will wait for 2024 Pro Max Series 
"cool absolutely positively NOT BUYING IT
AND YOU ALL SHOULD NOT EITHER Like why barelly an upgrade from a 12 13 or 14 pro
HIT them where it hurts there wallets

DIMINISHING RETURNS"
So underwhelmed with apples iPhones  still prefer the samsung galaxy phones but Im glad people keep buying it cuz I own so much AAPL
Am I only one who cares about RE
"Did I understand this correctly The main feature is a cable connection that has been standard on Androids for years and in addition they cheaped out on that exact main feature So people pay 800 bucks for USB 20 connection speeds of 10 years ago without fast charging I love when people look down on Android because laughter is the best medicine
Typed on a pretty cheap Android with 30 speeds and fast charging"
The one big plus to all of this is going to be the surplus of available lightning accessories Buying an old iphone will be a good budget option across the board
This phone is lame
Not just type clol
Probably the only time Ive ever wanted a video sponsors products Anker makes nice stuff
Ya nah im just gonna wait for the 16 hopefully thats somewhat different
Still no pen support 
You didnt mention the feature Im most excited about which is the ability to film spatial video
Iphone 15 not just usb c its usb c 20
Fast charging isnt great for battery longevity and I guarantee your their market research shows the vast majority of people charge their phones once a day at night while they sleep  I never got the hype for fast charging once phones had achieved batteries that I basically cant kill in a day unless Im on it constantly and then my neck hurts anyway and I need to get off the phone
20w in 2023 for 1200 what a stupid buy this phone
Oh I will be getting one will be upgrading from a iPhone 11 Pro Max finally USB C
Dont forget Apple was forced to change the port to USBC its not some holy grail feature that they Wanted to provide consumers Why wasnt this mentioned
Seems like technology reached a cap 
You gotta huge shout out from apple in their event I saw it and I was mindblow Keep up the good work
I need clarification I watched the event seen a few reviews and everyone is saying 5x zoom but when you look on apples website it says 10x Am I misunderstanding something
Were sticking with our two people 12 minis
Would you recommend moving from a 14 pro max to the 15 pro max
It seems that Apple has lost their creativity I wouldnt buy a new phone just because of a new port
I am very tempted to upgrade it dont know why  I have iPhone 14 pro max lol
Leave it apple to actively screw their customers and have them gush over it
Same phone just different colors
Who else the pov from tiktok
Not worth the price Never buy Apple products new
I cant help but hate the 15 Pros brushed titanium finish it reminds me too much of the 6 
We saw all these in the Keynote
Ray tracing for the macs thats what pro community was waiting for Finally 3d rendering programs will not take triple time of twice as cheap windows laptops with nvidia gpus
"Why didnt they include fast charging and USB 3 speeds

How else would they sell the 16 next year "
I might just wait a few years I love the 15s new body curved edges and I like the action button too I just think that a Titanium body is doing too much for me so Ill wait it out
Still thinking hmm
Was waiting to switch from Samsung to apple but wanted USBC so this and all the Samsung haters was the reason to buy
Ive never heard a black guy sound so white  its kinda cool
Old wine  New Bottle  Many takers
Marques tried really hard to sound excited about the new phone but you can tell its a really underwhelming device by Apple
Apple is a joke People got fooled by brand
Samsung has had an action button for many years Thanks for the video
Crazy to think the base models dont even meet up to android expectations lol
"USB 20it still 5years behind
Pro also need to buy cable to use USB 30"
In My Opinion Its Not Worth Upgrading To the IPhone 15 Or 15 Pro  First Of All The new iPhone 15 Has The Same Specs Of The IPhone 14 Pro same a16 Bionic Chip Same 48mp Camera And The Dynamic Island  and The only Difference About The IPhone 15 pro Is that Its Made Out Of Titanium    and The USBC Port Boo Hoo  So If You Have The IPhone 14 Pro Like Me  Then Keep It Trust Me Youre not Missing Much
Apple isnt even trying to push the limits anymore lets just upgrade the camera one more time and change the charging port  Mean while Samsung introduced a masterpiece in their galaxy fold 5  Guess theyre banking on ppls sense of commitment to Apple through their Apple cards icloud accounts and various Apple only products or services At this point an Apple release is just about as exciting as watching paint dry  Ive had every iPhone up until the 14pro I wanted that sense of something new and couldnt resist the fold 5
"Personally revolutionary what the Iphone 15 pro for the gamers than what you said it to be It Officially handles PC or console and maybe both which is new yet others didnt taught off although still have doubts given they known to lie to there Fans

This is what the Founder would have wanted than be just stay in lane and  be a French car company

Which Apple thats not suppose to be its identity its about being Bold and innovative"
getting rid of the silent mode switch will be a pain for me  Having the switch means I can verify if my phone is on silent without even having to take it out of my pocket  I actually do this often in meetings or rehearsals etc where it would be rude to pull it out  Looks like in future Ill need to pull it out and boot up the screen to verify its on silent
Nothing new Skipping again 
Litning is a iPhone thing its not iPhone without Litning
Wow USBC Keeping up with Android phones again No wireless charging Thats coming in 2033 Much to do about nothing Just a new phone to make the iDdiots buy a new phone
Marques if you were told not to review the Huawei mate 60 pro by the US government or Apple blink
This feels more like a iPhone 145 due to the incremental changes Its also important to note that iPhone consistently leave out technology that other flagship phones have adopted for years just so they can have a new feature to talk about in the next year model like its the best thing since sliced bread so that their consumers can lap up in the next model Very smart business model that fools the masses
Apple BORING
if steve jobs was still alive i gaurantee we wouldve had the first translucent iphone back by now
Only reasons to upgrade is either youre an apple enthusiast or your current phone is absolutely cooked iCloud Storage update the best thing that happened at the event lol
Good review Anyone upgrading from the 14 Pro Max to 15 Pro Max
HI GUYSIF YOU REMEMBER COUPLE OF YEARS BACK TIM COOK WAS CRITICISED YOUTUBERS TO DAMAGE THEIR IPHONES SALESAND NOW TIM COOK YOUTUBERS HELP TO SELL HIS PRODUCTSI THINK TIM COOK WILL BECOME GOOD POLITICIAN
Trinity give me a Trinity effort for my intelligence and strength God in Christianity give me a God in Christianity effort for my intelligence and strength Jesus in Christianity give me a Jesus in Christianity effort for my intelligence and strength Holy Spirit in Christianity give me a Holy Spirit in Christianity effort for my intelligence and strength Saint Joseph give me a Saint Joseph effort for my intelligence and strength Mary mother of Jesus give me a Mary mother of Jesus effort for my intelligence and strength
Congrats on the shout out from Tim
Growth without innovation 
I wonder if you can game with the 15 pro using the usbc video out on a TV with a controller 
"Im annoyed
They could have put thunderbolt 4 but noooo they want to include that next year

Unless they are doing this because they are planning on adding thunderbolt 5 next then I would be very happy"
Apple just introduced usbc and also increased the cost to 50month if you trade your old phone in My 14promax works fine and the software upgrades are always on point Gonna wait for cutting edge tech til inbuy a new iphone
I remember back in high school the new iPhone drops would seem to be revolutionary every year with new designs and new feature and it was always the talk of October Now I couldnt careless I still have my 12 pro and the difference between that and the 15 is minimal and not even close to justifying replacing it
The strength of the rails does matter The steel rails led to less glass breakage than the aluminum because they deform less The rails deform is what can lead to cracking or breaking of the glass If the titanium deform less than the steel it could be possible it has a tangible impact and how often the glass breaks during a fall
How the hell do you people live without a back button
So the question is New iPhone 15 or iPhone 14 Pro
If I dont look my phone I think you white guy i love your accent 
Am keeping my apple watch ultra  but i might upgrade to the iPhone 15 Pro
"HUAWEI Mate 60 Pro Harmony OS 40 Kirin 9000S Octa Core 120Hz 88W 50MP 12GB512GB 119898
 Hope you will review this phoneI bought the Huawei Pro 30 on your advice and never have  found a phone to replace it Still my Go to Phone   I love the curled bevel on the screen I have access to all the google apps"
A small omission Its important to note apple were forced to add USB c to conform to eu regulations it wasnt a consideration that was decided due to the consumer
Its quite disappointing that iphone price just doesnt match its valueno more Apple for me
iPad 10 is usb c
When Apple TV films their movies with their procinema grade video ill call it pro
Given that the 15 is a repackaged 14 Pro is it really worth getting that or should you save some money and just buy a 14 Pro
typec iphones have to use apples aproved cable because Cant wait for glaze TIms Cook and justify this non sense
An 800900 phone still having a 60hz screen in 2023 is unacceptable
Crazy how one customizable button is highlighted feature
Quick comment on the Titanium frame It is NOT stronger than the Steel frame It is actually weaker Titanium has more strengthweight but is not stronger than steel
Bro posted 18hr ago and 6 mil views vro Is no plying he knew it from the beginning that he is gonna be the best tech reviewer
Samsungs action button 
MagSafe duo no longer available Hopefully moving to USBC rather than discontinued completely
The whole world adopted USBC years ago but when Apple finally comes up to the modern standard its big news
Marques at this point has 10x more viewers than CNN  Hes been the man for years and deserves to be on the front line of tech releases
The thing Im most upset about with the iPhone Pro usbc is WHERES THE THUNDERBOLT I mean people are being wowed by the 10Gibs when thunderbolt 4 would have so much more potential I mean Apple helped create thunderbolt how could they not put it on the iPhone The iPad Pro has it
If you have a iPhone 13 and higher its a waste of money to buy a iPhone 15
These phones are like cars you dont buy a new one every year only when you need to  These morons in the comments act like theyre supposed to add a teleporter or a laser gun with every years upgrade
now apple is copying the USBC port again 
If it can survive a 4 inch drop test Then I will think about why Apple will always market users to buy more expensive phones with their low quality products
So I was considering buying the Pro Max if I could use my Apple card zero interest option over 12 or 24 months only to find this is not possible unless you sign up for a contract with one of the regular cellular providers I just wanted the unlocked phone so I could use it with my contract free provider without a monthly fee Guess I wont be buying one Probably wont affect most people
750 Actually technically steel is stronger than titanium Titanium gives you close to the same strength but with massive weight savings and better corrosion resistance
Applying portrait mode after the pic was taken is an existing feature
I was expecting a 15 mini  Im sad now
I dropped my 14pro max so many times and its flawless no dent scuff or cracks thank goodness its def way more durable then its ever been
So the iphone is literally becoming an outdated android little by little Samsung and other Androids already had that customizable button too Iphones are always too late
Pro Max has 100 focus pixels on the 5x telephoto camera and Pro only has 6 focus pixels on the 3x telephoto camera while paying the 90 of the Pro Max price is everyone OK with that  I would pay more for a Pro Mini with the same feature as the Pro Max though
iPhone 15 pro max is just name change of iPhone 14 pro max
"i am using galaxy s10 should i upgrade to the upcoming galaxy s24 or change to iphone15
also i have been an android user my whole life"
I feel like Im one of the few who wants a small phone I have an 11 now and the phone I want is the 13 mini
Nice wallpaper  I want it
Hi MKBHD I cant afford to buy an iphone  Can u give away an iphone for me
Camp Android  No walls around this garden
An apple event was something people used to look forward to seeing a new possibility coming to their handheld devices now all that apple event brings is to copy and boast about the features Android brought to the market many years ago More power to opensource driving innovation Woohoo
Its really just getting more pointless iPhone 15 14 13 12 Same thing different price
Biggest reason to get this will be the type C otherwise not that different from last years phone
Im goping to wait and see what reviwers say 1st before I buy the new iphone then even then I prob will wait to see what samsung does next  as of now I dont think I will upgrade from my 13 Pro max tbh
iPhone 15 is boring  what a joke apple
Is it me or just that iphones are boring Maybe instead of making a 1323 minute video about the new iphone just make a short for 30 seconds
Thats what EU said so get on with it 
I meeeean truthfully not much EXCITING in a new phone
Great Ill still keeping my 11 pro max and wait for iphone 16 and finally buy the iphone 14pro max haha
so essentially no real reason to upgrade again this year
So youre telling me I now have to share my phone charger with iPhone folk No thanks
I did clearly hear about that replaceable back And no where on apple page I could find more info Cant wait for tear down
Imagine paying 1300 for a USBC Charging Port
your friends Android phone Nice
Can someone just tell me what the fucking battery capacity is
Mute switch gang for life Keeping my 14 pro until it evaporates
Until apple frees the file system so I can plug it into my PC and be able to transfer any files I want in both directions then it is totally useless Talk about ZERO control
If the rumored pixel prices are true then this is a big blow
Are you GS or 1K
Back in the day every new iPhone launch was a huge event We were waiting for something new and awesome When was the last time you felt that way Accion button New COLOR
Some monster is going to turn the action button into the Bixby button
underwhelmed
Ohhnice new button I can have my power button back Dangthey just gave me an iPhone 14 pro max for work like 2 months ago Maybe I should have waited till this drop Since USBC and Ive been changin everything I have for that
Actually I think the titanium framework is the biggest innovation of iPhone 15 Pro Its really complicated iPhone 15 Pro has internal aluminum body but titanium alloy that they have to solder this two kinds of metals together and prevent aluminum from erosion The higher cost from titanium raw material and the process has barred many Android vendors from adopting the same practice
Is it time for me to upgrade my XS
203040 megabytess they saving that for next year so they can say it new
When is Apple finally gonna get rid of notch Im tired of the slow progress on iPhones I might switch to somethin else
Pretty disappointed by the lineup Normally I upgrade every 2 years but I think Im waiting till the 16 this time
"MKBHD Samsung SETTLED
Also MKBHD Guys please Apple is more than the USB C"
Can you use one of those iPhones as a Magsafe charging pad for an Android phone iphone receives wireless power and sends via USBC to an Android phones that is hanging around Now you can make a USB LAN with your 2 phones iPhone and Android using a USBC cable
All these stupid phones slow down the following year
I am waiting for new macbooks are announced so the 2022 midels go down in price so I can finally purchase the 2020 model 
Literally no one is talking about the iPhone 14 series valued way less in Apple store when you trade in for the new iPhone This years iPhones are really minimal changes compared to the last 14pro when switching from 13pro for example Last year was like bigger battery dynamic islandwhich was cool and still is and camera mp up to 48 But now this year is just titanium frames 20 more faster chip and 20 better graphics Idk who game a lot like that on iPhone If you are a real gamer you would invest in any gaming platforms And most of all yea the forced usbc now looks like oh we upgraded now its better for yall hahaha Its a joke Im a person where I value my newest iPhone I bought across the year Last year when I switched to 14pro max Apple valued my iPhone 13pro max as up to 800 like you would invest 300500 to buy new iPhone at that time so I did This year however the iPhone 14pro max 1TB costs steeply 650 compared to the difference values from 13pro to 14pro that 13 costs up to 800 while the 14 costs 650 for trade ins It doesnt make sense while both phones have big differences in hardware quality and performance But the latest one got less value Is Apple trying to cheap out their trade ins because a lot of people find it convenient I dont get it really and it affects the outside market too of you trying to sell it somewhere else not Apple if apple values your last year iPhone that cheaply
Im good with my iPhone 14 pro  This just confirmed my suspicions that its largely small things or things that we would barely notice anyway
Most cringe inducing Apple event ever
Android is still the king S23 ultra blows the iPhone 15 series out of the water
Query  Can they add fast charging later with a firmware update
Whatching this with my Realme 8 5 g 
Waiting for your review but will probably upgrade my iPhone 13 Pro to the 15 Pro
Titanium is actually not stronger its a common misconception that titanium is some super metal that is super light and indestructible In actuality titanium is lighter than steel and stronger than aluminum But its not stronger than steel or lighter than aluminum Its just a happy medium best of both worlds sort of metal But steel and by extension stainless which is actually harder than regular steel is stronger than titanium
Yeah theres basically no difference between 13 to 15
I really hope they wont add a extra 200 bucks for you to pay because of the new usb port and other things
Honestly Not a bad update overall I considered the 14 Pro the iPhone perfected so in my eyes there wasnt much they could do to improve it further The regular models having the island is good titanium finish on the Pros is pretty nice and the action button is a nice improvement to the mute switch Ill be hanging onto my 14 Pro but I think anyone with something older would do well with getting the 15s
What is a folding lens It physically folds
Did anyone get a Samsung ad in between
Of course he gonna say good as they use his name but this iphone is disappointed
Interesting to see a lack of innovation in the iPhone the same year their AR goggle comes out
"Im glad they finally made the change to USBC Thanks EU 
Hopefully we will see the port speed bump in the base model 16 Definitely a step in the right direction"
At this moment if it come to technology development in smartphone sector we already squeezed all the juices and implemented everything what we possibly could This does not applies only to the iPhones but every smartphone company What we might see in every new models of every possible company are really slight changes of the camera and power which in current state is useless because our phones are overpowered Please start enjoying this mile stones instead of making videos about new impressions of revolutionary new models as classic say do not be ridiculous
"I cant believe Mkbhd just flew over the fact that the new iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max can RUN CONSOLE GAMES WITH RAY TRACING LOCALLY NOT WITH CLOUD SERVICES 

Im an android user and Im not switching but I cant believe nobody is as hyped as I am for this and for what it means for portable gaming

Like Its not gonna be just another mobile game with console quality its gonna run the Resident Evil 4 Remake Resident Evil Village Death Stranding and the soon to be release Assassins Creed Mirage NATIVELY Like wtf I know this isnt a gaming channel but the technology needed to run those games on a small flat slab with freaking Ray Tracing is blowing my mind and I feel like no one cares"
The 23rd iPhone 
ok so USB c was forced from the EU for wastage youre welcome
It doesnt really matter to me I just upgrade every 3  4 yrs
Basically just 13 minutes of yeah I dont know man its an iphone with a usb c port 
New Bixby Button
For the first time since my iPhone 4s i may think of buying Apple
Not just usb c but almost just usb c
Ive been with google since the nexus series and have been holding to my pixel 5 for a little over 3 years now USBC is the deciding factor thats getting me to switch to iphone Excited to see how life is on the other side
Honestly you must be crazy to buy an iPhone these days Apple is so anticustomer IMHO Sent from S23
I think i will wait another 1 or 2 years until they will really bring something innovative for the year we live in not usb c and 5x zoom and tell us that is innovative I wanna see big updates on cameras like better low light performance on ultra wide camera larger sensors not few changes from software like 24mm28mm35mm focal wich is just a crop from main sensor  we are not stupid
sooo standard samsung google ect stuff but 3 years ago
Im tryna figure out if its worth upgrading from my 14 pro
Why are they so much impressed with the new charging port in Iphone Like they invented it and still no fast charging feature
I have sort of a lovehate with apple  Their gear is rock solid and performs well in 99 of use cases but they continue to nickle and dime folks and are slowing vastly on the innovation front  Im sure many folks have commented on the same thing but they still have the best ecosystem of connected products around
I thought about changing from my s23 ultra but when I told the att person that Ive owned every s series except the s1 the s7 and the s8 and a few notes in there also he said he wouldnt advise it because I will feel bored with the phone in the customisation being iphone doesnt allow any custom themes and all that and a few other reasons so I decided not to do it The 14 pro max in purple is a beautiful phone but so is my cream s23ultra
Do the standard 15 and 15 Plus have a Pro Motion display or is it still 60hz
glass is glass and glass breakes
So much stuff that have existed on Android for years Its so sad how people are always in awe if these announcements Not saying you shouldnt prefer iPhone if you like it better or like the ecosystem  but recognize that iPhone owns you
Think im going to get the 14 pro
Cant believe people are willing to dump 1k on a phone I mean good for Apple I guess but this is a microcosm of why so many people end up poor Do you really need to change your phone every year
Sometimes it must suck to be a tech reviewer like pretending to care about this new iPhones every year
Can we talk about heat management and two app on one screen multitask  love your videos btw maybe u talk about it they will do something
"I like my lightning cables And compact size of a lightning port 
Anyway the iPhone charged wireless from the very beginning
the better standard lost again to the more popular"
Overpriced for what it has sticking to android yet again
So disappointed this year
why is nobody talking about why double tap is a series 9 feature only Weve had the assistive touch tap and clench interactions for awhile now why not just use the same code for that to add double tap to old watches
I get it every year Prob gonna fold again Its just how they have us at this point lol
Raytracing on a phone Oh boy
finally someone mentioned the questionable more repairable claim
    757
No reason to upgrade
1149 fin
Apple should make a new slogan Its the same
Still need lightning for Apple TV remote
Im torn between my 1st iPhone IPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max 14 Pro Max feels too big for me but I like the telephoto lens Anyway goodbye Android
Sooo nothing has changed Phone havent changed in years
Finally Apple is in the Android league Compromise on lower variants so that higher variants can be justified 
I think apple needs to switch to a two year release cycle for the iPhone longer development time more wow factor iPhones last a very long time do we really need a new one every September
14s
USBC  NON USBC speeds LULZ
"The launch was about what I expected USBC improved cameras faster processor Mostly the same old song and dance different year Its getting harder for them to differentiate between model years any more I was expecting the USBC to actually be Thunderbolt to help move video and photos off of the phone quicker Kind of did that kind of didnt 

Ill keep my 13 for now It does what I need it to do and I have plenty of lightning cables"
Imagine plugging your iPhone 15 Pro to your 16 Pro and migrating your entire backup in seconds
For once politics did something good forcing the usb c thank you Europe to work for the people
Will the iPhone 15 camera features trickle down to the 14 Pro series I mean the normal 15 is basically just a scaled down 14 Pro with USBC
Im going to skip this year
"Watching on my IPhone X
Is time to update Is this the one to go for"
USB C has a nice little wafer circuit board in the port of the host device to break off Not as solid physically as lightning port
mkbhd  I remembered you did a video  on reaching pick smart phone back in 2019 and I believe that this year we have  looking at samsung S23 and Iphone 15 there realy is nothing innovative and exciting 
I still love my 13 pro max and dont see anything that makes me want to upgradebut I am going to to give my GF my 13 as she has like an 8 I could just get a 14 I guess But LITS
Hell nah I have that phone already 
"So much more detailed and more common sense than other reviews 
Marques is a naturallike he was made to do this"
One of Apples problems here is that most of us have been living with USB C devices and Lightning devices for a long time In my case Ive had USB C iPads for a couple of years So I dont feel much desire to spend the money to upgrade Meanwhile Apple has shown as you say that next years basic model will probably have the features of this years Pro So thats another reason to shrug and wait
"Phones really need to be like 4500 usd again Everything in the best phone doesnt look or feel all that expensive

And dont give me the but Samsung is cheaper crap Their flagships are also waaaay too expensive

Currently on a refurbished xs max that I bought for 250 Seriously dont feel like upgrading any time soon The camera could be better but how much do I actually use it Never"
I know why they didnt send you one
Keep your 14s and 13s until 16 comes out
And who really cares about new phones anymoreunless you bringing something truly earth shattering there shouldnt even be events for them
Thank You Microsoft for introducing USBC on Windows Phones back in October 2015  You were right about this 
Damn that looks like a monster I might upgrade from my iPhone 12
The worst update in the decade I never so fewer change in an iPhone for a decade I will go for the huawei mate x5 or honor magic v2 for the same price of the pro max
Good to be told which charging intercompatibilities we get with USBC as an Apple user although were might already using it on iPads or Macbooks
I want one 
I have the Xs max so im definitely upgrading
Lol these phones are literally the same thing as the previous models 
Nobody tell the fanboys that Samsungs had USBC since 2017 and USBC 30 since 2019 
Wish Elon Musk and Tesla could do something with a phone I am starting to dislike my iPhone
Oh my such innovation It looks so different
im wondering if because the 15pro phones have 10gb transfer speed now they can transmits video such as an HDMI output tried to do some research but couldnt find anything about this
Baha Apple were so pissed the EU forced them to put usbc on their phones Then they made that the big selling point about the new phones cos they had nothing else to say about them
Just wanted to see if apple did actually something this year but naah except the usb c nothing else was interesting
yeah the bezels are thinner oh wait that have just curved the frame so it makes the bezels look thinner if the frame was still flat the bezels would still be the same
Maybe its time to try something new Apple is starting to bore me with their designs 
Worthless phone
See Im an android guy and I like iPhone but theres so much that Samsung has that Im waiting for iPhone to adopt this is a step in the right direction but they are not there just yet and once they get there Ill be ready to make the switch unless of course if Samsung adopts some things that apple has like FaceTime and Imessage games 
Its still same shit
S23 ultra gang 
Geeno mention that Tim Cook mentioned you by name
Im superficial Ill buy the pro model and not even make use of half of the new features in my 3 years of owning it I bet after the first year of using it I will be starting to adopt the new action button for everyday use
Would you like to hear some good news This is the best news youll ever hear All of us without exception have sinned and fall short of the glory of God Romans 323 And because God is just and will not let sin go unpunished the wages of sin is death Romans 623 As a result that means that as sinners we will all get what we rightly deserve eternal punishment which is called the second death But the good news is that God is loving and does not wish that any should perish but that all would come to repentance 2 Peter 39 So He made a way for us to be saved and now graciously offers you the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ Romans 623 all while justice is done He sent His Son Jesus Christ to die on behalf of us and pay for our sins on a cross and He was then buried and rose again on the third day 1 Corinthians 1514 Regardless of who you are or what you may have done if you believe with your heart the gospel   which I just mentioned above and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord you shall be saved Romans 10910 Salvation is simple and free Its not a 12 step program and dont think as many do that you just have to be a good person or do good works to go to heaven Salvation is based on what Jesus did not what you do Ephesians 289 Believe in Christ and you will be saved For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever should believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through Him John 31617
USB c port but not as card slot Lame
iPhone 14 pro user here I barely plug in my phone anymore thanks to wireless charging so until it has a smattering of new features like better USBC transfer speed and power delivery and reverse wireless charging I wont feel compelled to upgrade Also I love the mute switch since iOS 114 so the button isnt a draw for me Back Tap and Siri do any of the other features I want especially with Siri shortcuts Seems like Apples uniformity will keep the action button present across all devices so Ill end up with it whenever I upgrade no complaints Im happy they made it a press  hold to avoid false positives with volume buttons nearby Brain dump over lol thanks Marques for the continued hard work
Im thinking that the 16 pro is going to fit nicely in that 1100 empty price slot in Apples lineup next year
How Apple holds back some features for the pros for the latest version only for USA only on purpose are holding me back from supporting Apple Im now looking for ways to escape their ecosystem
sorry cant help but notice the really cool phone wallpaper in the thumbnail would you mind sharing it hehe 
I was hoping for more of an upgrade Hopefully performance will be better which Im not counting on being that the performance of the 14 is already superb I dont think Ill be getting another iphone when apple comes with a foldable I cant believe still no fast charging
OH Also I expect to hear about the shoutout you got during the Keynote on WVFRM MK LOL
am sticking with my 13 pro max
usb c 20 in 2023 is just a scam
Seems like this was a VERY BORING Apple event
Are we sure there isnt a separate USB3 controller in the regular 15 vs on chip in the Pro
"Ill be getting the 15 Pro Max to replace my 12 Pro max Not because I think its much better or anything but my 12 haptics dont work and the camera wont focus other than being in 10X If those two things werent happening Id be waiting until the 16 to be honest 

That titanium gray is damn sexy though "
Can I please get a pair of Air Pod Max
Question  with all the camera updates and increased data per image increasing file size at what point is it actually driving away from ordinary users What is actually essential and most efficient
I remember hearing about Apple buying some startup camera company over 10 years ago that had developed depth measurment techniques to dynamically adjust the focus after pictures were taken  Theyve finally implemented it
Amazing
I have the 14 Pro Max so wont be updating Theres not enough to do it for me
My phone 13 pro use to be very bright 45 days ago on light since this new update i updated 1661 i have a feeling that this new iPhone coming out cutting out brightness so they make us believe they done something better with their screen shifty apple
So usbc is the greatest new feature but it does not bring forth fast charging smh
Usbc would legit make me change
Great video thanks Still have iPhone X and just not seeing any practical reason to upgrade yet
Wouldnt be surprised if the USBc cables had some code that makes apple brand cords mandatory
Its unfortunate apple had to do the very apple thing and add USB C but not give it a new enough version of USB to have any faster transfer rates then the lightning port did
As someone who switched from android all through my childhood to an iPhone 13 Pro Max I am absolutely dumbfounded that they would get rid of the mute switch I mean sure it is technically there but come on That was a top 3 reason I got this phone
Great new devices but my iPhone 14 Pro Max is totally worth it so Ill wait a couple years more
 IMPORTANT MKBHD FORGOT THIS BIG THING imagine u bought an iphone 14 pro Max 256gb last year for 1282 us to trade this Phone APPLE DECIDE to give back 680 this is nonsense 680 for a phone that has a year and somebody will say IPHONE do not lost value imagine THE iphone 15 pro max Only have usb C a camera that gonna still be the same and APPLE want us to PAY 1199 thats CRAZY
But Marquees couldnt they have just made an action button out of the volume rocker with a software update I mean Samsung has been doing this for years already
who cares about the iphone they al look the same anyways but has anyone seen the alien in mexico 
Welcome to 2014 technology iPhone users
They throttled the speed on base usb c I know shouldnt be surprised but man they always playing games to get you to upgrade
It would be cool if the action button could be used as a shutter button for the camera
IPhone users welcome to 2011 Android
Cannot wait for USBC gate when everyone looses the plot for apple ditching a superior durability connector for an easily damaged USBC connector
Honestly not impressed This only benefits someone who is upgrading from a very dated model like I did from iPhone 7 to 13 Pro lol For all the X users your time has come haha For the rest of us its a no for me
Ive bought every new iPhone initial to top of the line versions since version 1 I was one of the people in line back in the day then online in the middle of the night to land one when they used to sell out fast I stopped at version 13 and havent been excited about the new ones since including this one
Typical Apple Why not USB4  Thunderbolt 3 like my PC
So when are you going to make the Google assistant shortcut Marques
"Oh Apple iPhone in your sleek design so fine
Why do you sometimes lag behind the tech line
Features tried and tested for years theyve thrived
Yet you take your time keeping us deprived

With each new innovation you pause and contemplate
While Samsung boldly leaps doesnt hesitate
USBC at last youve embraced the change
But simplicity alone sometimes feels strange

Dont be afraid to take a bolder stride
In this fastpaced world let innovation ride
Youre catching up its true thats plain to see
But a touch more daring would set us all free

Apple we adore you your design your grace
But in this tech race lets pick up the pace
Embrace the future with courage in your heart
Then youll truly shine and never depart"
Im an Android user probably will stick to it
I generally wait at least 3 years before changing my phone I have the iPhone 14 Pro Max with 1 TB of storage more than the usual 256GB I get since it was all they had at the time and I didnt feel like waiting Almost certainly I wont change my phone for another 2 years maybe 3 I will be getting the latest watch however
6 million views in 17 hrs Dude youre a giant
What new design
Not really worth upgrading unless u coming from like an iPhone 8 or something
watching this on my iphone 14 plus which I just purchased last month and now Im regretting the USBC port and frosted back on the new 15 Plus I shouldve waited atleast a month for this phone
We can even buy a car in Sri Lanka for this money
What a boring iPhone 15 nothing new
Tim why would the company of apple include Lust in its event title I find this disturbing
Im the camp that will buy an older one after this release 
When is the iPhone sapphire dropping
I have usually been upgrading my iPhone every two years and being that my current phone is the iPhone 12 Pro I will be upgrading to a 15 Pro  Undecided about which size but serious thinking of going to the big one this time  First off was thinking of upgrading to 256Gb from the 128Gb in my 12 Pro  and second the 5x camera  Although I dont take a lot of photosvideos with my phone since Ive biked 2500 miles in last 4 months my phone is more frequently the only camera on me
Not sure why people keep buying these garbage phones All marketing and years behind the competition I guess people love paying for a brand
Have an action button on our work phone people are often seen walking an talking with the flashlight on 
Its a good thing that Marcus pointed out the lack of fast charging capability of the iPhone 15 series I will bet that such will be the next upgrade of the iPhone next year
Team  Keep my Iphone 14 Pro   
Now I cantt tell at a glance or by touch if my phone is on silent well done geniuses
I could only afford iPhone 6s current price in 2023 just watching in out of curiosity 
MKBHD being quoted in an Apple keynote checked
Im tired of the terrible battery life of my 13 Mini as well as the dull screen especially outside but have zero desire to haul around an enormous brick everywhere  especially when Im trying to stay off my phone all day
But why type C what happened to thier lighting
"The only 2 things that are very important to me are lacking in this Iphone fast charging 50W and advanced AI based voice assistent 
I wasnt planning on upgrading so im glad im going to wait another year"
"USB3 released 15 years ago in 2008
Apple have USB2"
Correct me if Im wrong but there was a rumor back then that apple was going with USBC back when iPhone 5 was launched but apparently it was not ready causing them to make their own with lightning cables Even though its late Im glad they finally did this
Thanks for the great video as always I am least interested in 15 have a 13 pro working great not impressed with anything 15
I just want the baby pink color 
Usbc was pretty much forced on Apple by the EU no way would they lose that market Its all about the  with Apple
More dongles
"Trying to convince my wife to switch off of iPhone bandwagon 1700 CAD plus tax for whole lot of something that came in android phones about 3 years back is not worth it 

People use iPhone because they are enslaved to iOS ecosystem Besides that theres nothing worth buying"
The highlight is a poxy port change  Come on that is weak
Im waiting for the ultra model itll be such a big leap over the 15 promax you wouldnt believe it
I just sold my iPhone 13 Pro Max to get the 14 pro max no need to get the 15 iPhones at this point are extremely fast that your  really not going to be able to notice iPhone 15 definitely not with it Ill Walt until something actually changes with the design
The colors is very disappointed
"USBC Cool great 
5X Great Only on Max not great I prefer 61 in phone
Action button is useless Volume rockers already do some of the highlighted features I shall wait for iPhone 16 I guess I have a 12 pro

Edit oh and once again the non pro phones have the better color options "
15 years the same phone Its definitely not the best experience you had some years ago
A Bixby button Was that on a Galaxy S9 or something Is the iPhone becoming an Android phone
It was a very quick sentence but the presenter who spoke about USB 3 did say that we would have to pay for that cable So it sounds like it will come with a standard USBC cable unless Apple decides to not put one in the box but then we have to pay for the one that unlocks the more powerful features
210 the one cable to rule them all
shall i update to ipohone 15 pro max or to ultra watch I have ultra watch and 14pro max Any suggestions pls
It feels like they just threw in a new casing camera and usb then called it a day
Wait I cant purchase the previous iPhone 14 pro Or max currently have the iPhone 11 still the best iPhone Ive had since the 6s
Waffle House found a new host
Usbc so 2015 
So this years iPhone 15 lineup Very extremely exciting to see as it is every yearIts a little better here or there than last years iPhone The phone doesnt even look different for God knows how long I have the iPhone 13 pro and honestly dont see the SLIGHTEST point in even considering the iPhone 15 pro Thatd be like throwing money away I just want to thank Apple for being very innovative and pushing me and maybe many others to seriously considering getting another phone that feels and looks different for a change
Unreal how every single usless change gets praised with apple Ridiculous
so the action buttons is going to be instantly programmed to open google assistant
Just get rid of the charging port altogether Make it MagSafe charging only
I just want to the ability to turn off WIFI completely in a shortcut
No point upgrading as they dont have FastCharge yet  some Android phone has been doing it for awhile now Shame it is
I currently have the iPhone 12 Pro Max  512 GB  and have wanted to upgrade because I cannot stand the camera Ive had issues with it since I first got it I honestly expected better My previous iPhone X was great It took amazing pictures right out of the box and generally did everything I needed Im looking to upgrade for two reasons  USBC and the hopes that the camera is better This latest iterative upgrade feels lacking in value and cost More an obligation to meet its yearly release cycle Thanks for the handson 
I absolutely like it has the usbc But considering to get the iPhones 15 because the did remove the awesome mute and unmute switch The switch is one amazing features what hold me back from getting a Samsung But now we are in the same bucket
My first smartphone was an Android back in 2012 and Ive been on android ever since That said Im not a fanboy but I have so many friends on Android that Im starting to really enjoy RCS That said I have a decent number of friends on iPhone as well Ive been trying to figure out if I want to switch and this latest iteration seems more compelling but Im still not sure I want to switch its a bit of a bummer to be honest
Anyone else here after seeing someone recording him filming the charging port on his RED camera 
I like to watch all of Apples videos and videos about Apple videos to remind me how broke I am to not be able to afford one 
Ill upgrade from 12 PM via trade in The new features are Meh but it would be nice for a change
Camp weak sauce itll be interesting to see what Google comes out with but I wont hold my breath on either
"1041 Hey Marques Brownlee about the default focal length thing nonphotographers might need to understand that if the iPhone really changes focal lengths and is not just a crop zoom then this is an amazing feature

Lets explain why Changing focal lengths on an actual DSLR doesnt just change the crop but also the way your subject is portrayed in regards to its background To make it simple a telephoto lens would keep your subject in its real ratio without distorting it and make it wider and make the background more compact which creates a more beautiful bokeh On the other hand a wide lense can make your subject look more distorted and make the photo look more personal imagine taking a close up with a fisheye lens for example which is the widest of the wide lenses

Pro and amateur photographers usually tend to dislike zooming and even if we have a zoom lens we keep it in one single focal length most of the time as we want to be intentional with how we portray our subjects Street photographers might prefer wider or standard lenses while Portrait photographers might prefer telephoto 

In short i think photographers would actually love this feature as I already do as long as its a real focal length change"
Same waste of money
EU forced them to do it after being sued thats why they changed to USB C
Yeah Im still not buying it its a scam
Come to Ghana 
Bro the apple id that was signed to that iPhone was a real apple id with iCloud plus subscription 
i think its a cool phone as usual but way too similar to the 14 pro doesnt bring much new stuff at all im waiting on a big change like we had with the 8X or something this just isnt that amazing to me

Debating on whether the iPhone getting USBC is enough to finally swap from Samsung 
I still dont get the hype Does it NOT drop calls Can it connect to WiFi like no other phone on the market Does it have a micro sd card slot  Does the battery R EALLY last more then 24 hours  So the only win here is for the marketing group Its just a hand held radio made to do two purposes Make marketing look really good and cost you a lot for the same thing Hey apple wanna be innovative Come out with a phone that does the SAME thing year after year but cheaper
Yes I cant wait to buy the phone i already have
Im really not in to buying an iphone at all Very satified with a medium buget android phone which costs less than the cheapest repair price of an iphone screen What a waist of money for a phone most of you only bought to impress other people
Its USB C but its data transfer the same as the lightning port
So should I abandon Android and make the switch to iPhone
Im definitely getting a new one Gonna get the iPhone 15 Pro have the 14 pro max but dont really need A pro max
Legit sad Mr Jobs is gone Im curious what the company would be releasing today if he were still here
im happy with my iphone 6  at least i can open it and unplug the battery in seconds
hmmm boring af
Honestly the new button alone makes me think of upgrading
Apple is getting more boring year after year for the last what 10 years
Its hilarious how far behind apple is with shit The only thing about the iPhones are video quality camera transitions and the lidar sensor
this iphone is a flop
Im just happy the 15 is now offered in black instead of midnight
60HZ DISPLAY  1499 BASE MODEL IPHONE HERE IN OZ IS ABSOLUTE RUBBISH 
I wanna say Tim Cook mentioned MKBHD by name 3x Epic
again nothing special
Been waiting on the usb to upgrade my year finally
Already prepre ordered  I just want usbc so I cant finally use one cord for everything Thanks EU 
 1000 bucks for an usb port and some minor cosmetic changes And some people still think it is a huge deal when in fact they are being scammed by apple 
Removing the 128 GB storage option for the Pro Max is so strange
Im glad there isnt anything to make me regret getting the iphone 14 pro Max earlier this year
Wonder how much they pay this token
Ill keep my 12 pro Nothing innovative from an iPhone in years
This Friday I am going to Verizon and paying the left balance of the iPhone 13 and trade it in for either 15 Pro or Pro Max Thank you for sharing your comments about the lineup and describing your opinions on the phone
Basically what iphone does is add another number to the previous iphone cause they know a lot of spoiled and rich heads just care about buying the  new one  because it would be considered a fancy thing
I was expecting a more in depth impression on the new much more powerful GPU with hardware enabled ray tracing which for me is the biggest change this year
"man this is what i want from iphone is 
bigger battery life by atleast 2 more hours
10 gigs of ram
phone profiles workpersonal life separate businesses
able to convert to a desktop hub with entry mac software kinda like samsungs dex mode 
dedicated separate chip for gpu entry level so i wont have to take my ps5 on the road with me
native remote and controller support from hub station"
Rocking an 11promax so kind of due and 15promax looks great but sort of want to see what Samsung shows in the new year 
STUCK AT 2019 TECHNOLOGY  POOR ISHEEP
I think this year Im calling it quits  Im thinking about Samsung Apple definitely dropped the ball 
think I well wait for next year
Im still running on my Xs Max this might be the year I upgrade
Name a base model or any model of Android that has 10gb transfer speed So check your expectations
Its crazy that in 2023 people still dont have cases that makes no sense You spend over a 1000 on a product But dont protect it you all deserve it to break 
Damn Ive been following the view count of this since it was uploaded Crazy how many millions poured in
The next generation portrait has been available in S23
iPhone worst
I just have a quick question so with the new camera take a photo of the moon like the Samsung Galaxy 21 does Like the clean 16x zoom
Is Apple still innovative Ever since the 12 which I own the iphone didnt change at all The 15  sucks
I am HYPED that Apple finally made this switch to USBC We can finally have our longwaited future of using one cable to charge everything 
Fast charging should be the norm by now glad im samsung now
Wow groundbreaking usbc Laughs in Samsung Fold 5
To me this has to be the most lackluster iPhone release yetI mean to make the switch to USB c and not include fast charging is a ball drop
When I got my 11 Pro I figured Id be ready for a new phone when the 15 came out Nah The 11 still works like new could probably use a new battery soon though and Im not that hardcore a phone junky to justify four modelyears of nano improvements Plus IMO the 11 Pros are a much better looking phone than the rehashed Jony Ive Bauhaus BS theyve gone back to Ill probably jump when the dog eats my phone or some similar tragedy Although if the dog ate it I could just wait a couple days its waterproof
Im at the point where I dont feel the need for a better camera I feel like cameras are so good now we cant even see the difference anymore
Must have killed Apple to adopt a standard everyone else has They cant sell their own cable now
I have an iPhone 13 pro so will not be getting this one
I am a huge apple fan boy I have a Mac MacBook iPad Pro iPhone 14 Pro and even a 12 pro I dont see the innovation here They need to make folding phones they need to make something new Theres not a lot of innovation here Yeah new camera new software new hardware But its not that much different than a the iPhone X I want to see them come out with a competitor to the fold5 and with a dual SIM so I dont have to carry around two phones
This will be the first iphone generation i skip since the 4 its partially for financial reasons but also because single year over year performance gains no longer matter to me at all the best new OS features IMO are coming to older models and purple is my favorite color
My wifes 14 pro max had no water resistance She took it to a water park and put it in her bathing suit top Never submerged in water Probably sweat on it more It shorted out 2 days later due to water damage according to the genius at the Apple Store What a joke I used to take under water video with my S21 Ultra
disappointed you didnt lightly touch on why they moved to usbc
Apple is dead Nothing ever new comes out
Im waiting for the reviews Then perhaps I shall change my iPhone 12 pro max and get the 15 pro Perhaps
Before the Wonderlust event I was set and determined to get the 15 Pro Max as soon as possible  But Im a little less than enchanted with what Ive seen  I want to watch some more reviews before I decide  Ill probably end up getting one though  Thanks for this video  It helped
"Every NEW iPhone review
Basically the same just some minor upgrades 
This is what the Tech industry has become "
17 hours and 61 million views apple gaining customers every second
This is something that apple could have done years agao and probabaly then it would be having more customers than it has right now
too much money for a brick that you can never ever say is 100 yours the phone always belongs to them no matter what you say or believe
Bro phone is a trash Just the same design Oh my Iphone is outdated
"Im a new subscriber And in my opinion the most iconic thing about your videos are

1 your hands
2 your voice

Call me weird but maybe Others agree"
6 million views in 17hrs is actually crazy
Man so disappointing iPhones are getting so boring
This was the laziest most spiteful way they could have done usbc Its very clear there salty about being forced to do the right thing Like there is no good reason for the base model iPhone to be at usb 2 speeds and i cant wait for the apple sheep to be like uSb COntrolLErs arE REally ExpENsive ignoring the price tag of this phone and the price tag of the millions of phones and devices that have 3 or even thunderbolt speeds on devices that cost WAY less Same with fast charging Im at least happy to see lighting is finally dead at least but this is the stupidest way they could have done it
meh
It has USB C only cause of Europe forcing them  Yet  they managed to screw all the fanboys by making the usb slow as hell unless you use their cable
I like where theyre heading but Ive got a 13 Pro Max already I might hold out for another year or 2 I like that they added USBC although it wasnt a deal breaker for me That being said I would like to have seen fast charging on it Overall this feels a bit more like a stopgap for me As someone who prefers the Pro Max models Im just not feeling like this upgrade is worth the 1200 for me realistically Id probably get a tradein deal and pay 600 to 800 but thats still not good enough for me Well see though
I am looking for the wallpaper do you know where I can find  Ty
Cant wait to see Jerry take these apart and see that type c port
bruh just stop they are still making the same phone lol nothing new like Samsung Im sorry but they lost the war already they couldnt even come out with a foldable phone nothing I was waiting till apple came out with something iconic but instead they gave the public the same damn phone 5 times since a foldable has been out like why why make your fans suffer why not do something new and mindblowing like a foldable iPhone or foldable iPad
I always keep my phones for 5 years and it is finally time for me to upgrade again I had an 8 plus and it is too big Part of me wants the pro and that is how I was leaning but I am not sure I really need it to be honest
Just left Apple after 10 years for the ZFlip5 and I like it so far That android auto correct is trash tho
No one talking about the new construction of the phone separating the back and frame along with the rest of the insides only picking up on the other bad stuff Always interesting seeing people favouring certain things over others just to prove their points
Still cant use the action button to toggle location on or off Best iPhone ever

Kisses used to make us pregnant human were born in eggs what if sexual boundaries are a lie
Hi ive got the Iphone 11 base model 64GB from 2019 release day I was wondering if anyone could recommend me if I should upgrade to the iphone 15 base model or pro i am not interested in 67 inches i do not really do anything major like take pictures or film videos etc I use it for its main features of course like any other phone provides I was just wondering if the jump is necessary or should I wait for the next iphone to really WOW me because right now although they have made some new additions to the base it really is not that much that justifies the upgrade from the 14 The camera upgrade isnt really of use to me dynamic island is nice usbc is whatever
"Nah its definitely just iPhone 14 pro USBC

Biggest S year to date really puts the I in incremental"
You when you have to point out stupid shit like fading colors on the back or texture or satin vs gloss it is going to be an severely underwhelming iphone  Too bad everyone wants the views and will see the clickbait title and fall for it just like I did Iphone 15 Impressions Not Just USBC  Then proceeds to talk about how the new iphone is just the old phone repackaged
not sure if this exists but i would LOVE to see your travels from the time you get on a plane to a major event like this eg what you do for dinner are they hosted do they pick you up at airport etc
1 cable for everything bay beee
Get your Anker promo out of my face Thumbs down for the video
"1107 This is me I almost always zoom in a little bit to 13x or 15x when taking a picture I just like the way it looks better and switching to the 2x or 3x is just too much

Although personally i will not be upgrading solely for this feature i have a 13 Pro Max and it still feels 95 as fast as the day i got it plus the 1415 models dont have sim cards huge dealbreaker When this 13 eventually kicks the bucket ill be switching back to Pixel"
Is it me but is anyone else charging box dying out I have replaced two of them so far
Philippines  
S23 Ultra is better and the S24 Ultra drops in January iPhone is trash lmao
Click a photo and you can later make it a portrait Youre telling me I phones could not do that lmao
2000 nit screen Thats awesome
Going to need you to do an updated video when the vision pro is getting close to being released next year Still on the fence if its worth the money and what I can do with it since the developers have had time with their apps
will I be able to get a clear picture of the dang moon 
I cant believe its still at 60 hz what a waste have to stay with android for another year
I like the natural the most and it reminds me of the classic silver Plus it matches my Apple Watch ultra Too bad I wont be upgrading my iPhone 14 PM This is the first year Im really going to try hard to pass Ive upgraded launch day since iPhone X Preorder trade my phone in at the store pay the balance and I got a shiny new phone for the next year Every year I say Im not upgrading but this year Im really going to try I dont see how moving away from lightning is so great bc I am still tied to lightning with Magic Trackpad airpod max and airpod pros so if I still have to keep a lightning for those devices it really doesnt matter at this point plus I honestly use MagSafe 95 of the time Trust me Im all for usb c and I have tons of devices and tons and tons of cables and chargers But for me personally it wouldnt change much until all my lightning devices were gone Its a step in the right direction and sad they had to be threatened into it I also dont care they bumped the base storage and the price bc I always get the 256gb PM so nothing changes for me same price same storage What would have been exciting is if the bumped the storage but kept the price It would save me 100 usd I think the phones are pretty boring this year Titanium And the periscope Are exciting I wouldnt upgrade just for usb c though as I mostly wireless charge and like I said still depend on that cable for other stuff Its funny how people can get excited over that and its the industry standard and apple only implemented it bc they had to
iPhone XS Max to iPhone 15pro max wort it
Crazy how Im watching this thinking They didnt really change anything And then thinking Ill probably still get one anyway
The matte colors look  the black and blue
Sticking with 13 Pro because you know the economy
Amazing video
I was happy they fixed the back glass design so its easier to repair As someone who the iPhone 8 Plus and shattered the back weeks after launch my wallet will definitely appreciate this
i hope to god they dont make the usbc have some bullshit that reduces the charging speed if its not an apple certified charger or charging brick if so that defeats the whole purpose of the EU forcing them to add on a usbc
Hi Im still getting a new IPhone because Im a big fan of Apple I talked about how Samsung doesnt or didnt show me that their support access is as good as Apple Im still waiting to talk to a Samsung representative Love Apple Apple makes you wait for the things that has been out from long time but make you feel like its going to be way better than everyone elses Lol lol I love tho I cant wait for my new IPhone 15 Pro Max I believe my life is to dependent of these new phones Lol Well people collect cars art etc  I buy a new iPhone every year Its my birthday and my Christmas present to myself all wrapped in one Thanks for another fabulous video
Overpriced 
I dont understand the decisions that Apple is making here I have an Ipad that my work provides for me that has USB type and a rapid charger This is the reason that I left Apple years ago they like to tier their products and prices in exchange for features that most other developers have been offering for sometime This isnt an Android V Apple debate but Android phones have had wireless and rapid charging for a long time Apple is milking its customers by thinking that features dont matter their customers will pay the exorbitant cost becausewellits an Apple
I am still on the fence will wait for your full reviews sir
Apple should make a built in dark screen Like to cover other from looking at yo screen
Should have just named it Iphone 14 extended version
"Im not buying pro why is USBC 20
That pink though that might be upgrade worthy Looks perfect"
"Was cool to see you mentioned twice in the presentation
SO gets a new one  to replace a 7
Ill wait
No fast charging  conserve battery life"
Kinda poor analysis compared to MrWhoseTheBoss
Apple be scamming this phone is a scam
Regarding the speeds of USBC its clearly Apples way of still pushing iCloud storage
"I adjusted my iPhone upgrade program date to match the new iPhone release dates Ill be getting the pro max 15 anyways lol
 I do like the new programmable side button upgraded camera and the titanium finish phone And USBC What am I gonna do with all my lightning charging cables now"
Does anyone know if Marcus has a boyfriend or husband Ive never seen him mention his name or any info on his significant other
12 Pro Max owner here Reason I didnt buy the 14 Pro Max is the lack of USBC Also I like to upgrade every three years I have no excuse
Rofl shame sht from 14  at least they added the s23 ultras zoom camera and  auto portrait mode Gtf outta here  portrait mode is terrible anyways 
Unless everything else you own is USB C or if your phone is just very out of date and having problems I wouldnt upgrade I would wait until maybe next year or the year after when they finally introduce fast charging which will make USB C much more worth it most people Right now its simply just a port change
"It is crazy how many people have been brainwashed by apple 
There is almost no difference between the iPhone 14 pro and iPhone 15 pro They just come with a new phone to have something to sell and still people go crazy"
Theres going to be plenty of young artists who cant afford the big pro model and use their regular iphones to make their content Its like half of apples marketing Why shouldnt they be allowed to have faster transfer speeds too
Debating weather its worth upgrading my 13 pro or wait for the 16 pro in a years time
Does  base 15 have 120hz screen
Going to map that button to a siri shortcut to open Google assistant
why not make it thunderbolt
So USBC is the big exciting feature for this years iPhones eh  I wonder how EXCITING things will be when Apple finally add a microSD card slot gets rid of the massive hole punch and brings back the headphone jack  That will be wild  Also I love that new bright pink colour 
"Just curious thats why im here but titanium and a action button wont justify upgrading from the 14 pro max lol
Last year i did the upgrade from 13 pro max to 14 pro max and i was regretting it because the dynamic island end up being a gimmick and the rest was pretty much it the same Anyways happy for people that are getting this amazing phone "
After having iphones from 4s all the way through to the 14 nothing last few years have changed i wouidnt say this latest release was a show stopper i recently swapped to a ultra23 fast charger so my things you can do i will stick with this a few years see what apple has down the road
Bro needs to be in a movie the way hes acting like these are new features 
Im just excited for the USB accessory industry to go insane now Since industry follows apple is one of the truest statements of all time you already see the controllers camera accessorieschargers and whatever else wasnt worth the financial investment because Android despite having as huge user base just isnt as popular to third party companies
Naw not worth it imo USBC isnt a headlining feature cause they were forced to do it Imma try to find a 14 Pro Max then allow for sometime a few years for the rest of their ecosystem  product lines to catch up and get on board with USBC
Im bummed that the 5x lens is only in the larger Pro
I have an idea for your channel to Grow even more perhaps thousand times more Have your videos Translated into other languages
Green
Its trending 4
Somebody tell me why nextgen portrait mode isnt on iPhone 14 Pro  it has the same camera as the 15
I have the 13 Pro so not sure if this is worth an upgrade honestly Im going to see what Google and Samsung do
Saving the fast charging for the next release
looking forward to whether or not the additional 5x on the bigger Pro is worth getting it
what were u saying at the end of the video
Camp dont care Se3
So the biggest change was the switch to USB C but you still dont get all the capabilities of USB C NICE
My man has been confirmed as a beast of the tech industry by Tim Cook himself But that was a trick from him to have this  review for free
No matter what camp one is in on this subject this is the most hyped new iPhone drop in years
Nice phone nothing really impressed me but still getting it because my 12 pro max is starting to give up on me
My S23 does support 45 watt charging speed USB  C does support 100watts so why the hell did Apple screwed their clients Takes 10min to charge my phone
104 the one piece is real
The European Union forced Apple to unify with the rest of the world to lower techno trash for recycling
I need a pink Prooooo Maaaax 
"So the iPhone can charge airpods is cool
My Samsung phone asks if I want to charge the MacBook "
No 120herz on the base model is so ahhh D why apple
233 removed the headphone jack and now theres this too funny
There is no new thing there just normal stuff we always see 
Love that the usb c innovation is only there because of legislation
Its cool But Im going to hold onto and use my 13 Mini until it dies fingers crossed that it will be a few more years unless the unthinkable happens and they make a new mini
With a case alot of design features are redundant The only big change to me is the usb c port
No fast charging We all know that iphone is good a putting old stuff latewhen other have been using them for a long time
"fast charging is bad for your battery
im not to eager to get that so its good they prioritize battery health over charging speed"
Great video MKBHD Currently as of right now I have an Iphone 14 plus and still rocking back and forth to whether I should upgrade to the Iphone 15
"Biggest apple announcement this time is a usb port change and only after when EU forced them
The rest is quality of life software changes and new  chip more focus on pro model camera Although I would say 3nm chipset is a big deal but nothing ground breaking with this new launch"
Now the US has some balls They release new material that can compete Not their coward move of sanctioning Huawei Iphone 15 thats a brave move
Im sticking to my s10 until something more revolutionary comes like the s10
"Thanks Marques great first impressions as always Ive currently got a 12 Pro in blue and although I like the blue iPhone 15 Im drawn to the natural titanium finish partly because its a change from blue but also because I think it will age better Also it might match my Apple Watch Ultra 

As for the USBC change as a UK citizen I was mildly irked by our incumbent supposedly impartial news channel BBC News headlining that Apple were forced to change from lightning to USBC to save customers money They completely ignored everything else about the event including all the good stuff about climate change and carbon neutrality and taking recycling to the next level 

I mean does anyone seriously believe that Apple planned to keep lightning forever It was brought in at a time when MicroMini USB were the other alternatives and the iPod dock connector needed to go Phil Schiller even said that lightning was the connector for the next decade and that was about 10 years ago I have also read that until recently no manufacturer could supply USBC sockets in the volumes and qualitydurabiility required by Apple for the iPhone Can you imagine the furore if iPhone USBC connectors started failing after a year or two like we see regularly on the likes of the LG Ultrafine 5k monitor It would be another accusation of intentional obsolescence just like with the batteries

As for the customers saving money bit I note that Apple have released a 29 USBC to lightning adapter so you can continue to use your lightning chargers and other peripherals with the iPhone 1515 Pro Or you can avoid the need to spend 29 by spending even more on a new USBC charger which doesnt come with the iPhone 1515 Pro All the legislation has achieved in my opinion is to give Apple a perfect excuse to switch from Lightning to USBC without all the criticism they got when they switched from iPod dock to Lightning all those years ago Sorry customers but we were forced to make the switch  but heres a 29 adapter which we can sell you to ease the transition LOL

Anyway I think Ill be switching from my iPhone 12 Pro 256GB in blue to iPhone 15 Pro 512GB in natural titanium To me having 10Gbps USB3 connectivity justifies the cost of the extra storage space even though I historically havent needed it all"
Looks like theyre getting closer to not being immediately disqualified from consideration Now that they have USBC all they need is app side loading and fast charging in an option at or below 800
I am most likely gooing to get an iPhone 15 this year I was going to get the 14 Pro for the 48MP camera but the 15 has that too It will be a big upgrade from my iPhone 11 I am soooo ready to have an sweet OLED screen
I found Apples presentation very boring No imagination or excitement
The action button alone makes me want to make the switch but not 1600 worth
I might switch back to iphone next year if they got rid of the island and changed the UI
Iphone 15 wtf apple sucks Nothing special at all
This is apple they just can not let their clients at least to be happy with thier new big change to type c jack 
I honestly believe they purposely hold back on things they could actually implement so they could have a new selling point year after year Because like they say Samsung has a lot of those features already so if Apple were to implement everything that we believe they should put in these phones for the price they wouldnt have anything else to sell in the next six months to a year in my opinion
USBC ONE PORT TO RULE THEM ALL
The big ugly notch still there
So when are we going Samsung 
Im glad they finally switched it to USBC even though its annoying that its noteworthy
Im still rocking the 12proMax and this one doesnt make me need to run out and spend more for a new phone than a new pc
I have an 11considering upgrading to the 15pro
Is upgrading from the 11 pro max even worth it 
Can I get one for my son He is a tech youtuber
The lack of USBC is the only thing that made me skip on the 13 and 14 Its absolutely ridiculous how long it took them but Im glad its finally here
Meh Ill continue to stick with my iphone 8
"Marques did you mention that every single component of the iPhone has been serialized to prevent owners fixing their own device with aftermarket parts Literally if you chip the screen it has to go back to Apple to expensively fix because any other screen compatible with the iPhone 15 will cause the device to either not work or have unexpected behavior because the serial number no longer matches

So does the iPhone actually belong to you or is it really Apples Apple loves anticompetitive and anticonsumer behavior like this that prevents the Right to Fix your own device and it is Apple that is causing the worlds ewaste to get ever higher in thirdworld countries because its cheaper to throw away the iPhone than fix it And its the same with the new M2 laptops  all of the components are serialized to prevent nonApple repair"
hmm my 14 pro has been acting a bit strange since this recent update hmmmmmm
Knowing the iPhone has a type c feels like its a android 
Me watching this on my redmi note 8mhh interesting
U gotta love applespent years selling a unique chargermake millionsthen ok now for a New grif will make the same charger everyone else uses and our drones will hail us and buy more hopefully they wont notice that they already have at least a dozen of them
glad i switched to samsung flip 5 from iphone 13 pro best decision that ive ever made and im an android user again after 5 years
I would like to see iPhone without  a charging port since I use my MagSafe only with my iPhone 14 pro and it does a great job
to be honest there is not much update about iphone 15
Uncommonly I dont like usb c I prefer lightning it looks cooler and still charges my phone pretty quickly so Ill stick with my 14 pro max as long as i can
6M views in just 16hours
Gonna pre order the 15 Pro Max debating between natural or blue USB C is the biggest selling point for me and its time to upgrade my 12 Pro Max
Imagine not having the living outside the US tax 
Its not even REALLY USBC  Its a USBC plug  Its Apples proprietary implementation of a USBC like product
So apple no innovation or risks taken The island keeps getting bigger and wider in the front camera 
Europe forced Apple to inovate
Every time I watch your videos you make me take my case off 
Look at all the idroid shills in the comments Marques how much are Apple paying you
Biggest feature is spacial video There prepared for Vision Pro ecosystem This phone is just a placeholder Im not buying it I probably wont upgrade until another 4 years
You know its bad But you dont have the guts to say so The USB was forced upon Apple They did not have a choice Stop trying to make this as a apple feature
TLDR its just usbc
Apple are so far behind Androids USB C the main selling point in this age crazy
The amount of shilling
That custom button on the side is a nice feature to me
The mute button is no use Unless you can do multi tasking by pressing it
Seriously dude Adding portrait blue and depth has been on Google Photos not only for Pixel but any other Android phone for quite some time now
Am in the 3rd year of my 12 pro max  I swore to use my phone for 4 years until I get a new one  and I will 
New hardware same phone
What a disappointment Hopefully the ultra will have a better camera
How about you comb your hair or cut it first impressions are everything Iphone looks boring and eco friendly They copied Android now usb c and no flip or fold phone 
I dont know hunmuch and iPhone cost but its certainly more than 500 Having a phone at that price have usb2 its just ridiculous
Will any ssd drive work with the 15
Keeping my 13pro
samsung s23 ultra is way better than this latest iphones
apple pioneering the way for usb 30 connectivity in 2023
I was trying to buy into the hype of USBc titanium body action button but its quickly dying off Might stick with the 13 pro for one more year
So Apples Iphone has now caught up with Android phones on this planet 
BroI just got the 14 last year in October why would they release such heat when Im broke ahhhhhh
They could totally bring that add portrait to older pics thing to older iPhones but they wont The fact that most Android phones get camera updates with OS updates still makes me kinda sad as an iPhone 11 Pro user I could have long exposure on all lenses and that kinda stuff but hey Nope
Youre welcome for the new accessories Android users
I have the iPhone 12 Pro Max before that the X Im gonna hold on to my pro until theres something worth the buy cause this aint it
Quick question pleaseSo will the IPhone 15 Pro max have wireless charge Thank you
Watching because Im interested in what apple has decided to do this year but probably wont get a new iPhone for another 2 years Currently have the 14 and its not enough to want to upgrade Also think the action button is stupid and as someone who always has their phone on silent If I switch the action button to do something else will my phone now ring Dont like that
Want that Neutral 15 Pro Max to match my m2 MacBook Air starlight 
Was your tshirt sponsored by auto trader
iPhone with a USBC port looks like a cursed image   
Not worth the money
IPhone 15 came and pleaded with android for a type c usb theyve been longing for it
Wow Apple taking 8 years to put USBC in their phone after Android already did it Classic
1 cable for everything is such an improvement for the environment
Why are people still praising Apple for doing absolutely fuck all every year
I think the biggest change by far for the average iPhone user is the dynamic island
not worth it
Here I am again watching something I cannot afford
Normally upgrade every 2 years and will be skipping this one
Now Google will announce they have figured out a way with RCS texting will make iMessager secured and will be blue
still only 60HZ LMAO
Such a loss to not have the action button be different than the mutesilence button
As always great review Ive been in camp Upgrade Program for 4 years now and look forward to this one device getting its yearly upgrade Also congrats on the quote shoutout in the keynote video
"The biggest innovation is USBC FINALLY I will be able to use the same charger for all my devices
And lets be honest that one is driven by the EU So thank you EU"
Banger review
2023 iPhone found about USB C Wow Just wow
Apple is so far behind Android phones and all the different phone options Wow USB c cable 5 years behind No thanks
"cpu upgrade camera update slight software change case slight modsame for every iphone new version every year No breakthrough Not really anything steve job one more thing surprisesame old same oldand USBC forced by EU is the only highlight for old apple users that now you have to rebuy everything Not that its any difference from SamsungAndroidsame old every year 
There is really no killer attraction that push you buy new phone except old phone battery deadglass crack And next iphone will be same old but with replaceable battery They will sell it like a feature for sure next year"
LOL the Action Button is your favorite new feature   Its the ONLY new feature
Fast charging degrades a battery quicker Honestly who needs to charge a phone that has battery lasts as long as these in under an hour You dont
Yea my brand new AirPods Pro uses lightning Gen 2 pro too Im not about too pay  for a new case
NEW charging port USB c 
Hows the Battery life I need sizes
Im still using iPhone 8 Plus and its really good so far for me
I am tempted to buy the 15 Pro solely for the USBC I love the idea of needing 1 cable for everything The ability to record video straight to an external drive sounds awesome too
Wait so the new airpods the gen 2 pro I need to get another case now
why cant the pink color be for the pro iphones 
Why cant the 14 pro do this next gen portrait mode
Naaa
Marques your so funny why didnt apple add fast charging the simple would be because its apple  The more in depth answer because of apples history would be so they can add it to the next iphone and present as a revolutionary feature 
And I thought the iphone 14 series was underwhelming  They look like fine enough phones but theres absolutely nothing exciting here  Its just another generation of iphones
Apple was literally FORCED to use usbc in this model or they couldnt sell it in Europe They threw a hissy fit and finally submitted And now its the headlining feature That means they a had no other real changes planned up until that point
Im camp I need an upgrade but damn Im only two gens old and theres hardly any upgrade from what Im holding now 
So we now have to buy new wired earphones and chargers
SoPay 1000 for a new charger cable Nah Im good with the 14 till Apple builds a new factory outside of China iPhone 16 wont be till at least 2025
As expected from AppleYAWN
Marques sounds different in this video is this a different mic from one he usually uses
Same shit over and over again
apple to KBHD why post a new video for the i phone 15 when you can rewatch the previous video about the iphone 14  it is basically the same
Im in the camp Iphone 12 and none of the features in the past 3 years havent convinced me to spend 1400 nowadays you kinda need 512gb at least  sales tax to the phone that actually become more and more inconvenient  Last year they got rid of physical Sim card in US version which is horrible decision for anyone who loves to travel abroad this year I would need to switch all my cables and still carry lighting cable for AirPods and Ipad  Its sad  I used to really look forward for new Iphone release
Finally I can use one charger for all my devices
I feel the phones have changed enough Im upgrading my 12 pro max Mostly because my battery life has fallen off drastically in the last 6 months
Youd still fanboy the iPhone even if they reverted back to a model from 4yrs ago
Theyre being so stingy with the usbc speeds ridiculous Just make it thunderbolt
"Title not just USBC
Video Basically the USBC but not that good"
Wallpaper in the Thumbnail Thx 
Iphone 15 mini wish it was a thing lol
I like Apple and Samsung Traded in my iPhone 14 Pro Max to Samsung Fold 5 iPhone 15 pro max is not going to bring me back My phone can turn into a tablet and actually multitask with 23 apps on screen That is actually useful innovation Most of these iPhone updates are not going to change much for the average users and most people are going to put a case on the phone Im glad MKBHD is normalizing Apples marketing hype while informing us consumers
Not Just USBC is such a sad title
Didnt know it could not fast charge till you said itWHY APPLE
think Ill just stick to android iphone has become far too expensive 1200 usd who in their right mind spends that much on a phone
Ive had my iPhone 8 Plus since 2017 will probably upgrade this year Although I was kinda expecting more for this new model Oh well
Honestly they should have put 2 usb c
Naw Im good 
So boring uughhhhh i mean the iphone 15s
"Funny how something like changing the port suddenly made it the biggest upgrade since the iPhone X 
They really need to innovate more imo"
Does the 14 pro max also get these 24 28 35mm focal length options
Idk sometimes your bias showsyou slammed on the 6a for not having 60hrzbut why didnt you slam this phone for it It has 60hrzand its premium price while the 6A was 400 bucksthis new phone also has last years chip and decade old screen for againa premium price
Sad now I cant joke about using non standard charging anymore
I wonder if the pie phone will out do everything if it comes out
Alright been having Galaxy for 4 cycles now I so now its a good time to ha e an iPhone again my last iPhone was the 6plus so its been a minute
MKBHD cant admit that this phone is lame as shit because he wants to maintain a relationship with Apple
So theres a programmable button that does exactly what you can tell siri to do
"just had a glance
Sht looks exactly the same yay how exciting"
Finally planning on upgrading from my iPhone XR and I love the colours of the iPhone 15 but I hate that its basically the same as the iPhone 14 pro I feel like Im paying for the newest phone but actually getting a yearold phone if you know what I mean 
So    youre saying I can finally upgrade from my fully functioning iPhone 5 SE  Ill consider it
I have the 11 pro and still dont know if I want to upgrade Does USBc work with CarPlay or sound any better
Worst year to upgrade
Dont care for it at all probably just stick with the 14 pro max for while longer till Apple starts slowing this bish down
"Iphone sheep until yesterday Lighting is superior in every way

IPhone sheep today Apple invented USBC"
Feel like a Boring phone Ill wait for iPhone 20
"Bro Stainless steel is stronger not Titanium 
dont pass wrong information to people "
I was thinking of upgrading  to the 15 pro just because of the 5x but after seeing the video I realised that only the max gets the 5x Nah thanks Dont like bricks Ill stay with my purple 14 pro
I will still buy samsung
Eh  Ive got a 13 Pro so nothing about these is particularly inspiring  But hey its good to know that Apple is still keeping the 3rd party accessoryadapter market busy
Samsung has them beat again
Basically refresh with USBC so that Apple can justify even more why they dont include chargers and maybe now even save few more cents by not including the charging cable while still over charging 
Was surprised you didnt mention the slow refresh rate
Really like the design of the natural color way but the 15s not for me If they would have added a more advanced version of Siri I would have upgraded from the 14 pro
should i get a 15 pro or pro max i want the smaller size but i also want the new features
Can we all agree the yearly updates are not it 2 to 3 years is better
yup only reason I hated apple USB everyone is using it no where going to make our own new charger cord you HAVE to buy to charge this phone fak them
Apple just decided to stop innovating I guess All of the past few events have been so lackluster
So from I see here theres absolutely basically no difference from the 14 and 15 Im not gonna pay 1000 for a brighter screen and new charging port
Since I dont have anything to transfer from my iPhone 14 pro max to and from everything Ive seen the fast charging on lithium batteries will shorten the life of the battery from many years to just a couple of years and from what Ive seen this goes for phones as well as electric vehicles is knocking off 30 minutes or so worth having to replace your battery every couple of years Im still using my iPhone 7plus it has 70 battery capacity Ive gotten a new bigger battery for it but havent gotten around to changing it yet And Ive had this phone for several years it still works great and most of the time I get better reception than my iPhone 14 and the wireless charging does the quick charging so why would you ever want to use a cable anyway throughout the years Ive had nothing but troubles with cables and the pore connection with the plugs wireless charging and transferring data by Bluetooth or over the phone networks is way better and if your stuff is so secret you shouldnt be using the phone for it in the first place
Im going to ride my 11 until it dies As I get older I could care less for updated phones
USB C is a welcome addition but otherwise seems like more of the same
You fly delta
Is an upgrade from an iPhone 12 Pro to an iPhone 15 Pro Max worth it
OMG it comes with a cable  How unApple of them
theyre saving USB C features for a later phone to make it look as if theyre the ones who are responsible for these improvements in USB C opinion
All i hear is the word same
Feels like we hit a wall when it comes to innovation with phones Especially apple The last 34 generations have been boring
The fact it took them this long for a usb c is kinda crazy
I really dont know why apple likes to capitalise so hard on their phones literally every year its just 14 new stuff other than that theres no innovation
Apple fooling applefans 
And were waiting for the s24
What new design are you talking about Its the same phone as the previous models and the one before that except floating island Why would anyone purchase this if they have iPhone 14 pro or any other pro model in last 23 gens
"Hey man

just checked your new parallelogram tshirt n it fkn rockssic"
Apple is in the late Nokia stage No innovation at all
Another apple paycheck Kaching
Nothing change skip iphone for  now
I feel like Apple should go to every 2 years for releases so they can focus on software better
Geeze You cant just shove more current into the iPhone to fast charge it 20W at 5v is 4A Thats pretty fast already Whats the big deal about USB C charging anyway I dont use a cable anymore I use the wireless charging at home and in my car
God loves you and wants to spend eternity with you but sinlyingcheatingstealingkillingnot honoring your parentsetc separates us from God because He is holy But God sent His only Son Jesus in our human likeness to live the perfect sinless life and to die in our place and then He rose from the grave into His eternal form So that we can be reconciled to God through faith in Him by Gods grace Confess Jesus Christ as your Lord and savior today and He will send the Holy Spirit to live within you and guide you Tomorrow is not promised
Im in camp happy with current phone but if they pull off the gaming thing its going to be hard to ignore that if Resident Evil 4 can run on an iPhone then a lot of recent games I havent gotten around to yet could potentially run on the iPhone Id rather play them on a tv but I wouldnt say no to the ability to play them anywhere
got to get one thank you  I have the 11 base model  So this would be moving to another dementia for me
 the cheap 449 ipad
Every new Apple product will come with USBC because it otherwise cannot be sold in the EU
My main reason for always buying the new pro is the camera updates as I use it for quick marketing photos Really bummed to see the biggest camera change will only be with the pro max
Soooooo basically its the same as last year Got it
hahahaha typec  this no joke apple  only typec news  very bad
IPhone 14 20 
Zero reason for me to leave samsung Apple always seems to be behind samsung Im not a tech pro or anything but it always seems I have features that apple users dont have or didnt get until years later
Is this an S23 killer
"Its time to Bud Light Apple this BS has gone far enough
Ill own a far worse phone to avoid giving Apple a penny
Watch the Mother Nature ad that also erases white men from the room because they rayray yo then try to open your wallet its impossible"
I really wish they would just make the damn back of the phones metal so it completely negates the back panel even possibly breaking
I had the iPhone X and today i have a Xiaomi mi 11 for a year now honestly the only thing stoping me from going back to iPhone is fast charging Come on 20w is embarrassing low many times i forgot to charge my phone and needed to go somewhere Id just plug for like 1530 minutes and i would have like 6080 to use so fast charging its like a deal breaker for me
Your phone is an investment Buy a case Come on mannn 
Lol its funny how you just jumpsskips over the games thing in a sec Its actually a really big thing According to the claims atleast they are running full console level  games natively and this is the first time any phone is doing it which is actually HUGE
So the biggest upgrade feature is the change they had to make to comply with  the European Union ruling The upgrades get weaker every year
When I was an android user I used to charge my airpods with my phone cuz it didnt have a power brick in the box
Me sitting here watching on my Galaxy fold 5 happily
I am shocked you did not mention the faster cable Apple would be glad to sell us for even faster download speeds on the new 15
iPhone 1515 Pro Impressions Not Just USBC  its always positive never a negative title a negative video never even when its a boring product Like this one
Hi Ive got a 11 pro max do u think its worth upgrading
Outstanding review ya always the best 
"Can the action button run a shortcut while the phone is locked

Assuming the shortcut doesnt require feedback or the phone to be unlocked Could be a powerful button if you can just slip your hand into your pocket and run a shortcut"
Fast charging is too unstable for battery performance its expected that theyd stick with 15W charging because its less strain on the battery and they had issues with new phones losing battery capacity way too early
awesome
Cant believe USBC is a decade old and apple is almost touting it as some new feature lol
iPhone 145
Im in the camp of getting one of these phones That titanium 15 Pro Max will probably be a dream to hold
So even with USB C its not gonna charge any faster than my iPhone 12 Was kinda hoping faster charging was a thing even though it doesnt take that long to begin with
I have iPhone XR and I will definitely buy iPhone 15 Pro Max At this point my XR is slow and freezes sometimes Gets very hot when using outside Camera is good but not great as the pros
"USBC connector but no USBC functionality
My mothers midrange Samsung phone does that too But hers didnt cost 800 bucks"
to me the spatial video recording is waaaayyyy more exciting but no one talked about it
This year the best iPhone to get is the base model such improvements over last years horrible copy and paste iPhone 14
paying 1500 for iphone that have type C man buy phone for 200 camera for 300 Ps5 for 600  why  apple cost only 1
What is the wallpaper in the thumbnail Looks cool
I just compared my Iphone 12 specs with Iphone 15 in apple website and still pretty close config At least for me that use mainly for calls and normal social media usage thanks god one more year without spend money with phone
i get dissapointed with the iphone 15 is the same things the same design since the 11 i will consider samsung now
Im getting one simply because Im using an iPhone 11 and wanted to wait for the 15 before I upgrade
Yawn  
So iPhone 14  USB C  new metal  iPhone 15  For next year iPhone 15  revolutionary fast charging  iPhone 16
Why didnt Apple give credit where credit was do the reason they changed from lighting to USB C isApple said the company plans to comply with European rules mandating that new phones all use the same  USBC charging port Or we still be stuck in lighting port world  Believe me theyd love keeping us in their proprietary world
"Sad the action button doesnt have a double or triple press With the hold that would give it 3 options Wonder how many years itll take Apple to add that

Also you should drop Anker as a sponsor They be doing some shady stuff"
Im getting a android the battery on 13 went to sht after a couple months  86 percent pattery capacity and apple is azz backwards
I was thinking about getting this switching over but the volume switch is gone which is one of the things i wanted i dont wanna turn the phone on or even look to mute my phone  I want to feel that button and know if it is or isnt sigh
They should add a slave labor rating so people are aware of how much slave labor is used in these new models vs previous models
Same sht other than big typec update They knew if they come up with this product without typec they would get too many bad critics about this is the same thing like previous year They came up with typec to change the topic to it
Will Siri ever be updated
imagine being a fan of a company that ships usb c as a feature and then ships usb 20 in 2023
Anyone know if the customizable button can start a voice memo simply by holding down like a walkitalkie Or if its just gonna launch the voice memo app
I have an old Huewei P30 pro 2019 and it has aperture mode where you can adjust the depth of field on any subject in the photo Is this the same as the Nextgen portrait mode or is it different and does it only applies to people
Almost 6mil views already in less than 20hours 
Does anybody know if apple is carbon neutral or not yet
Why are you wearing an auto trader shirt
Another year of modest changes with exception of the camera zoom  Otherwise WHO CARES
I would want just for the button I have a 13 mini now but I used to have a s10e with bixby button and would use for play pause and skip for music
Thats nothing newnot worth it
Ill stick with my OnePlus that charges in 20 minutes
I use cloud storage to transfer all my file from my iPhone its much faster I dont relied on cables connection except to backups my phone
"For these type of reviewers giving us that excuse on the type C speed saying its ok not everyone gonna see the difference blah blah maybe Pro users would take more benefits because theyd be shooting more videos What a lame excuse Same phones design features old chip on the non pro And pro gets just a 5x zoom bad and new chip aiming st gamers Not everyone is a gamer Thats it and titanium frame We never asked And for him to just be ok with it shows how biased most reviewers can be Samsung did same design and got blasted Apple doesnt
He probably gets paid by apple

Hope you read my comment btw"
The action button kinda has been around on other phones but this looks like wider functionality
New features deff are not worth it if you have a 14 pro already
Only thing that annoys me with most phones including android is how much they talk about the camera yes I like to take photos every now and then and I love wildlife photography but how to make it look like everyone is going round taking professional selfies of themselves is just weird
Haha   same  phone just USBC  atleast the  EU AND  middle east  did  something  good but it doesnt  matter to me  Im  all  android
Having witnessed Apples transformative journey since the iPhone 1 its both nostalgic and somewhat disheartening to see the current trajectory Where once Apple was a beacon of pioneering innovation now it seems to be navigating safer iterative waters Siri among other offerings doesnt seem to match the groundbreaking spirit Apple was synonymous with My loyalty to this brand is deeprooted but the diminishing trailblazing ethos is palpable I earnestly hope for a reinvigoration of the audacious innovation that Apple once epitomized
I have a IPhone 12 worth getting the 15th Pro
Dam Apple this the same dam phone yall been selling for 6 years
So I can have Siri on the power button and google on the action button noice
"Although the upgrade of iPhone 15 is not significant there is no price increase in the United States
But prices have increased in other countries because the former factor makes people feel that this is an Apple event without any novelty or sincerity"
uea being invited likethat just a taking them into pocket cant say anything bad about it now otherwise they will risk it not being invited again
Ive been an iphone user for more than 10 years and i love it and change it every few years but this big feautures are to the point ridiculous like fr the usbc is just so it matches the cable of you mac pathetic
Still on iphone 11 pro max which the battery starts to get bad after almost 4 years so need a new one tho extremely expensive especially as I live in Norway I might get one more year out of it Always gone for the biggest model as historically they had bigger batteries more feature etc but this time around Ill go got the smallest and not the pro And just bummed about the usb C as I havent ha dan android phone in years so no usb C charger or cable
Theres no change to the main lens though in terms of quality is there just the other two lens Also mrwhoosetheboss mentioned about the shutter lag maybe because its also taking depth information aswell which could make a delay when pressing the button
If it wasnt for the fact that Android is so trash and we have no better alternatives Id jump ship from iPhone now
I remember having that portrait mode thing on my Honor 8 back whenever that thing came out lol
Meh theres nothing impressive about the new phone Seriously Ill wait another 5 years
Youre a good teacher and I like your videos alot Thanks
Wheres the mini
USB 2 Speeds on a Phone that starts at 800 in 2023 that is crazy Ill just keep upgrading every 5 years and buy used thanks
My question is the Pro Max camera THAT much better than the Pro I prefer the lighter and smaller version but for a significant photo difference Id buy the Pro Max
Glad to hear there is no price difference  Until I heard about the 100 price bump for the Pro Max 
Did you went and buy a greenish and blue pillow to match with the apple id cards or were they just there like fate at the hotel
Mid event
lol saw the other video where the guys video recording him recording the iphone talking about how good his camera is and then this video pops up and im watching it from his view
Can we get customizable Lock Screen buttons like camera and flashlight are useless camera more so but both are already available within one swipe
there are BOTS on here Normal peeps would not say they are upgrading old iphone to 15 after no reaaaall upgrade to the new one its iphone 12 with USBc Cable 
None of the major reviewers are talking about the Thread radio that was added  why
next year the iPhone 15S will get Thunderbolt anf fast charging
But only pro has the full speed of usbc
those bezels are extremely outdated on both phones
WHAT WOULD A WALMART FLOOR CLEANER KNOW ABOUT I PHONES OTHER THAN HOW TO STEAL THEM 
my ipad isnt usb c
Do you know if they are fixing the camera processing of images 
Where can we get this wallpaper
No battery improvement on the iPhone 15 pro  I was expecting this because of the iphone 14 pro not lasting battery
Honestly is this discussion about new iPhones really getting down to just color and texture of the phones surface Apple finally got around to providing a USBC port which everyone else has had for years Hooptie do The Apple announcement was hohum to say the least
Im still rocking an iPhone 7 Plus way before they started calling them Pro and I wanna see if I can make this phone last a decade
"Not enough has changed from last year for me Usb c isnt a deal breaker when I charge while I sleep and it lasts 2 days anyway
Everything else is meh"
Thanks 
Im passing this year
Why deteriorate the battery with fast charging Or dont be on your phone all day
Apple taking shots at USBC
I still have my 7s  All this sounds so nice
LMAO 1000 for the pro USB C3 version Apple really has you fanbois by the balls
With every new iphone launch I think if I need to shift to an iPhone from my android and every time I laugh at the iPhone
Dont see a solid reason to trade in my 14pro max for the newer USBC doesnt make much of a difference for me as I use magsafe Camera upgrades are not substantial to me Action button for me is of no use as I prefer to flip it like a mute toggle So I am happy with what I have until Apple does something groundbreaking like a periscope zoom upto 10x or may be a iPhone that folds ironically which they might call the iBook Lol
Im in camp have to have one
i tend to upgrade every other year i currently have the 13 pro max i would like to upgrade but i think i might pass this time and wait for 16
Im still waiting for the iPhone 9
Apple is the only tech brand that can play with people sentiments and people are happy with it ditched the ringer switch on the side
"The World 3 years ago USB 4 is here
Apple Now Heres your USB 3 connection it saved us 69 cents per device "
Heres your 2023 1600 iPhone 15 Pro Max 1TB with 15 year old Technology and heres your 2023 iPhone 15 with 24 year old technology
I came here to comment on the legendary episode you made by talking about the bad camera of the iPhone 14 Pro Max and  of the sharpness of the photos The most important question is whether the sane problem in sharo photos and fake is in this new iPhone 15 are still as sharp as the iPhone 14 or have they improved them
After my Blackberry Curve 8320 HTC released the G1 With TMobile HTC Dream and that was my first Android phone I absolutely loved it I happened to work for TMobile at the time as a Dealer and that was around the time the iphone was launched with ATT Or maybe Cingular i dont remember if ATT bought Cingular before or after the Iphone launch Anyway my biggest Threat was the iphone because at the time it was ATT exclusive People would say they want the iphone and i would talk them into android I was a complete Android freak up until the iphone 6 plus came out I always bashed iphone but after getting the 6 plus and getting use to iOS ive had every iphone flagship since I still carry a Fold 5 with my 14 pro Max but barley use the fold My point is APPLE STOP BEING SO GREEDY AND GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT AND PAY FOR its a few months from 2024 and youre giving us USB Because you had no choice but then slap us in the face and say heres your Type C port but by the way were only giving you USB 30 That came out in 2008 and if you spend less were still giving you the Type C but because youre cheap and didnt buy the Pro you get USB 2 That came out in 2000 yes 2000 I have a 1TB 14 Pro Max and am using a good 800GB of that 1TB When the new phones comes out i still do an iTunes Backup and restore because its pretty much a clone VS an icloud backup Its just such a slap in the face in my opinion
Add a usbc female to lighting male to all the lighting items to get rid off all the lighting cables
Im still rocking my 6s
Im very interested in the zoom of the iPhone Pro Max but I dont want the physical size of the Max or the price
what got me was when apple started explaining about basically having 7 pro lenses in the camera I thought okay yea thats awesome I will film a movie when I find the time to do that And also if you are a professional photographer wouldnt you buy an actual camera If I hired a pro photographer to take some pictures wouldnt want them to take the photos with the same camera I got in my pocket
Apple is better then Android Lets begin the debate below
Programmable power button okay  48 mp camera Okay  The color selection on the Pro Version sucks   Throttled USBc not a fan of it  Not spending another 1200 for this iphone  Somebody else can have it
No one is even talking about the phone call noise isolation I love it Especially for my work calls
"The base and plus model have a slower USBC port while the pro models have the normal USBC port

Gimp

The new cam is only 5X optical zoom To tier phones feom Samsung have had 10x optical zoom for quite awhile

25x digital zoom vs Samsung with 100 and 200x digital zoom

Samsung still has faster modem faster charging reve3se charging qhd displays and more

Yet the iPhone costs more

With the exception of eccentric products when you get less you pay less

Apple makes you pay premium price for midlevel capability

Sad "
Its mean after all this years they follow Samsung USB charger and bla bla bla
Iphone is slowly evolving into a Samsung year after yearcant wait for that meme
Hhhehehehe apple was exclusive for innovation but no more
In other words Absolutely no upgrade necessary if you bought an iphone in the last 23 years
Looks exactly the same to me
The mute switch is a habit at this point Come on Apple
Titanium is not a good heat conductor which leads to conclussion that these phones might overheat inside
OMG Now android phone will include type c in their phone Thank you Apple 
So does the iOS 17 come out when the iPhone 15 drops
Titanium is NOT stronger than steeler it is weaker just stronger relative to weight
I love android and I dont know if im considering an iphone but I think apple did a very good job this year especially with the base models thing is im kind of deciding between the zenfone 10 or the base s23
Is 120hz screen still locked behind the Pro price point
60hz screen on the 15 in 2023 is a joke and dealbreaker Apple is milking that dealbreaker to get everyone to buy pros At least bump it to 90 Apple
Samsung fans Assemble
im probably skipping this year
What about APK
Im getting one My iPhone 11 Pro max is FRIED
Apple is trash compared to other phones They give you the same things over and over or they add in features other phones have been using I wish Android had the same ecosystem that Apple had cuz I would  leave Apple I miss my Galaxy
Which phone are you going to get Marques
Thats so funny iPhone people getting excited for type c charging port now i mean its so stupid  literally iPhones suck android is anyday best
Isnt the USB change just an outcome of the EU legislation  and apple not wanting to produce different variations of the hardware for different markets
love your stuff but wow your knowledge on usbc is lacking 
Ive always updated my iPhone with every launch except for the iPhone 14 Pro Max the one i received had a rare hardware defect where the GPS function didnt work so I only had it for a single weekend The iPhone 15 Pro Max will obviously be the closest thing to having the 14 Pro Max with the dynamic island the new camera and now USBC
I dont know why they didnt add one more button  I like a hard coded mute switch where I can visually see that the phone is on mute
Please dont fall into the bs about type c  Apple is trying to play it off like its there own brand new tech
Im getting it because I have a 12
Thier just cost cutting of technology
All those Engineers workin at apple  And this is the final product   Same Bullsh  over and over and over and over and over and over again  Lot of tech talkin but in reality they didnt do nothing
Im super hyped about this definitely going natural titanium for my pro max
Marques Brownlee  Can you use the customizable button as the old home button from the older iPhone models
i think all phones are getting to the point of diminishing returns the need to upgrade is becoming less than ever before its a funny seachange but in my mind i dont refer to the device as an iphone anymore but as a hand held computer and that makes me more accepting of smaller perceived changes
iPhone 14 and iphone 15  same man 
i think itll be a few years till the ipod etc have usb c i doubt it as that would be illegal phones and tablets etc have to have usb c by 2024 thats the eu law passed
This feels like apple powered by 1
imagine using iphone in 2024
do notifications come from the island on ios 17
My 11 pro is on life support rn gonna be preordering a plain ol 15 and I couldnt be more excited 
Ffs now everybody will be bothering us android users for chargers 
I only recently switched back to iOS aaaaaaand I have to say the mute switch is something that I came to appreciate a lot Having them replace it with a button is disappointing from my point of view Oh and yes Ive switched from a Galaxy S10 which did have a customizable button The switch is just something I enjoy much more for some reason
I enjoyed this video very much Thank you
For me the fast charging at 20W is a big drawback of the new iphones
How can anyone respect the phrase completely reengineered from the ground up  please
Lackwanderluster
I dont know how long Apple think they can keep fooling us
I have a 14 pro should i upgrade 
Did you also notice when Apple said with an optional USBC cable you can get 10Gbps speeds which means the cable shipped in the box wont be capable enough for iPhone 15 Pros
"No fast charging for the iphone16 

Youre asking for too much If Apple gives you fast charging now Apple wouldnt have anything to offer next year for iphone 16"
So thanks to the EU  iphone got a lot better
Love from 
Basically the iPhone is becoming Samsung 
You are amazing I love your contents 
155 base ipad already has USBC
Just prepre ordered my 15 pro max being 4 generations behind Im looking forward to the upgrade
Im getting it Im going from 13 pro max to 15 pro max
"Andriod whats your upgrade
Apple type c"
  
no 15 mini 
Samsung  has a secret action  buton
Hi Marques greetings from Vienna Austria Did you notice that Tim mentioned you in the key note They might want to have you on one of their next product commercials
I will consider getting another iphone once they add swappable memory cards I cannot support this artificial monopoly on memory anymore
The 16 pro better have 5x I want all that zoom but I dont want the large size
Im in the poor camp
They need to give 14 pro max the new portrait feature
Lightning was and will always be the best port
I have a 13 pro since it came up not going to change for a while but seeing the Iphone evolve like that is really cool and hypes me up to when Ill change maybe the 16 or the 17 still dont know
Just USBC should be the title LMAO
USBC little faster chip and better camera What else that can make me feel like I need a new Iphone I think I skip this one
Good to finally see type c but you cant use Google apps anymore on iOS 17 iPhones 15 upwards
Wait so the action button cant toggle rotation lock like the first iPads toggle could Oh you could do it with a shortcut I hope shortcut execution is seamless now and non intrusive
lol bro said friends android the fuck I look like being friends with an android
Ray tracing bro
I dont understand why people care so much about usb c
soooobasicallly no innovationthanks apple LOL
Thought the AV1 codec portion of the chip was an interesting mention as well
They should have left the mute button the way it was thats the only unique thing apple truly has these days It was one of the reasons why I joined the iPhone family 
Apple I phone 15 its like the iphone 14 but better
just boring apple as usual always trying to catch up with tech thats been release lonnng time ago lol anyways they have rock solid product and they just updated
They have to keep new features for the iPhone 16 Pro
The only thing that i like from iPhones is the built quality other than that they jus look like the ipod 1st generation 
"Ive been saying this the USBC port is not that exciting for the average user IMO As a repair shopowner I repair 10x more TypeC than I do Lightning

The best new upgrade again IMO Is the action buttonwhich will unfortunately not be enough to convince me to upgrade"
I know the Apple iPhone fan boys are foaming at the mouth about these new iPhone features BUT Android has had most of these features for years 
Dont care at all camp  Still enjoyed the video though 
Is it 120hz yet
apples innovation dead when Steve jobs deth   close the company and start a real eatable apple  business
Many people told me it wouldnt happen But here it is iPhone with USBC I finally get to upgrade my 6S phone to a version without that god awful lightning garbage Apple been pushing for years on end hurray 
so  60Hz for the IPhone 15  What the Hell
625 Thats for next years slight update phone
Im more excited about the new Mate If only Barclays would work on Harmony
Can you install a SIM card Also is it coming with the charger for the USBC cord
Its giving Samsung vibes 
I currently have a iPhone 12 pro max it has a crack line across one of the camera lens but still works Would it be worth it for me to upgraded to the 15 pro max
Being able to play console games on this chip is incredible
Waste of money Stop spending your money on these little upgrades
Would this upgrade be worth it coming from a 11 Pro Max I would love to see a video breaking down what that would look like for users with older phones
After three months its the same as a 12 pro  this is boring
Ah yes Anker our favorite unencrypted spywar I mean powerbank company
Eh Idk Ill likely wait another year to see what the 16 offers My 11 pro max should hold up We will see after I watch the wanderlust keynote
Im still bored
Another year another boring iPhone They really need to change the design its so old and outdated They really dont even try to shake it up just a little bit 
I have had my 11 pro max for 4 years and Im just get the 15 pro max and it hope it lasts for another 4 years 256gb or 512gb which one should I get
omg so happy for usbc
bruh i just got the 14 pro
I didnt see you saying nothing about this but I saw in other video not sure if its true But iPhone 15 pro and pro max will come with a cable that only supports usbc 20 speeds so in order to you use your usbc 30 speeds you will have to buy a cable Wtf Apple really
It looks like Apple is going to start killing batteries   Dont update your old Apple phone   is that an option
Best review I phone all time 
Whats the battery capacity on these
Im sorry but calling a switch iconic is just  ridiculous  Im sure browniee gets paid by applethis is a terrible update exactly the same phone yet again with these iconic updates which are minimal at best  Steve jobs would be disappointed how Tim Cook has killed apple innovation over sales
And here I was thinking to finally move from Samsung TO iPhone So questionable now 
Just from a personal standpoint on the action button I really wish you could Hold for a function and double tap for another to have 2 options Id do my mute switch and flashlight Crazy its only one
"Apple is just a phone now Nothing unqiue or revolutionary whatsoever Just a good product not a great product I went from the 12 Pro to the 14 Pro Nothing better about it at all just newer As soon as another company puts garage band equivelent into them and has similar privacy features I will jump ship in a heart beat

Best phone I ever had was the Droid Force So sad they didnt last"
Fast charging is break through technology for iPhone 16
Congratulations on the quote featured
My wife and I have always been her iphone and me andriod so this is amazing news about USBC No more two types of chargers everywhere
Marques didnt even mention that iPhone 15  15 Plus still have 60 Hz display in 2023
Bull Imagine the rest
Biggest new feature you mean its about time
The mute switch being just on the pro model is ridiculous Didnt realize buttons were only for professionals 
Enjoy it now guys this is the last iPhone ever being made
"Marquez THE IPHONE WILL GO PORTLESS BEFORE THEY GO TO USBC
"
Bro I watched that event live and teared up when I heard Tim Cook say according Marques Brownlee
YouTubers are that extra advertising Apple dont gotta pay for Fr thats smart inviting them in these events
Which one  is your suggestion iPhone 15 or iPhone 14 Pro
I literally have all these features on samsung
Barely anything changed its kinda gross theyre still charging 1099 for basically the iphone 12 with slight changes
Useless iPhone upgrade ever 
"Apple should finally change to being a camera manufacturer
With every new I hear people praising the freaking cameras lol"
Apple said during the keynote that the 15 Pro Max got the 5x camera due to extra space  no need to check with them on that Great vid as usual sir
Fast charging will be the big new feature next year Its silly how Apple does this stuff
i just wish the iphone 15 MINI was a thing wish they moved back to a tad bit smaller phones
Wow iPhone is now up to 5 year old Samsung technology Amazing
the reason its only usb 3 on pro and 2 on normal is because they want to have a new thing for the years to come
Im waiting for you to tell me to buy it or not  lol
I will love to have everything go USBC but right now my current iPhone 13 does everything I want a phone to do Maybe next year I will get the 15 at a discount when the 16 comes out For me a phone is this little box that makes calls and lets me facetime and take a few snaps nothing more
Im in camp I have to ge5 one of these because my current phone fell in water and still works but some features dont lol
they have to change to usb c because Europe wont allow them to monopolize charging anymore
I need to replace a phone so Ill probably buy a 15
thank god the EU is willing to stand up to these dumbasses at apple for their port this would never of happened if they didnt step in Pretty embarrassing that it took apple this long
I cant get excited about this anymore
I might get 1 Im not sure yet
Samsung has been doing the action button for years Its weird to see Apple stealing from Samsung for once
Im interested to step up from the 11 Pro Max while I still have trade value
Trash trash trash good video  though
Waiting for that Apple Watch Ultra 2 review youre working on Yeah I saw you wearing it on a studio video So itll start with Ive been using the Apple Watch Ultra 2for about 3 weeks now
The stupid invention that Apple has made Using the phone to charge accessories Thats the least you want to do waste the phones battery The same phone with a different number They had to do what Samsung has USB C
Wont upgrade my 11pro until next year maybe
No one cares about USB C Why do people even talk about this
These videos are like comfort food
Steve Jobs is rolling on his grave now with all this Apple innovations years ago
"Looking for advice  I have the iPhone 7 upgrade from iPhone 5c in 2015 now and am looking to upgrade this year What would be a good iPhone to upgrade to in 2023 with a budget of 1000CA My main problems with the 7 include the following
1  the battery drains down to 20 really quickly and then it slides down to 1 and stays there for 4 hours before powering down can get 18 hours of use out of the phone on a charge
2  Not enough storage  have 64 gb  keep having appsmusic go to cloud and having to be preloaded and have to balance between apps and music Thinking of getting 256 gb of whatever phone I upgrade to 
3  apps crashing refresh rate drops becoming more significant and more frequent screen loading of music app getting progressively longer
4  SIRI  is SHIT and doesnt understand 85 of what I ask"
Better GPU perf and ray tracing point to similar gains in M3 This is more exciting than USB C
Sounds like a whole lot of nothing ngl 
I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max still really nice phone but it has been awhile  eBay here it comes
2000 nits is the same brightness as in 14 pro
I wish they kept the mute switch and added the action button as well
And60htrz On the 15
Sir please help me sir someone Miss use my photos I removed in social media but he reupload that photos please help me to delete that photos in her phone please help reply fast sir
"The mute switch is such a cool feature Its not just useful for turning on and off mute but because its colored and changes positions you know whether it is on mute or not just by looking at it

Buy of a shame that they replaced it since we know every iPhone from now on will be missing it except for maybe the se"
Keeping my 14pro as these new features are really doing it for me
60Hz lmfao
"So far youre the only YouTuber in my subscriptions thats being realistic about this
The others feel like theyre still in the hype of getting invited to the event and blowing things out of proportion without even realising it"
USB c with 20 w charging which means charging speed no different and screen are same since iPhone 13 Pro only difference between generation is max brightness which can hold up under 5 mins under strong sun light camera better others same
Please do a Huawei Mate 60 pro  vs iPhone 15 pro max comparison
camp lowkey dont care about these new iphones lol
"Its crazy how in a matter of just a couple years the tech industry went from inviting zero YouTubers to these events
To Apple quoting Marques in the opening presentation about the MacBooks That was really exciting to see"
Coming from an iPhone 11 Id love to get one mostly just for the sake of USBC Cant afford to upgrade right now though so Im not getting one anytime soon I never plug my phone in anyway I just use wireless charging so its not worth upgrading for
yup getting this one next year when my iPhoneXS becomes 6 years old I can hand it down to my mom and Ill get the 15 pro haha xD
Apple over the next 6 years 10w faster charging unlocked
Just another disposable device on this small planet spinning around in space
Its time for review season Marques get ready for absolute hell of creating an indepth review in 5 days
Why not just wait 2 years instead of 1 for new models Maybe even 3 Those new phones do not excite anybody Or maybe just start to do some crazy stuff every year Every phone is boring now and we really get new phone every 3 years Going to change my iphone 11 if it dies Why they are so chiken about try new stuff now Just do some crazy new feature put some extra sceeen or wheel somewhere Make it do something stupid and gimmicky but please not ever again try to convince me to buy phone because it have litle different charging port or some slightly changed butron on side
Why is the audio sped up
Not interested Gonna use my iPhone 12 promax until the wheels fall off
"
As long as iPhones do not have fast chargingI am gonna keep on using my XS max and waiting"
MARQUES A lot of people dont talk about the biggest part about phones the phone There was a brief mention about the ability to switch on voice isolation when youre on a call for better clarity Can you just leave that on as a default or is that Apple being Apple
Another expensive item that is doomed to be irrelevant due to planned obsolescence  Pass
USBC 20 except for the pro model Just apple things 
My 2018 iPad pro uses Thunderbolt USBC connections that can transfer at up to 40Gbps 
When Apple or Samsung stage these launch events are any expenses travel accommodations meals outside of whats served at the event itself ever provided or offered I was curious if they ever try to buy favorable coverage
Biggest downside Ive seen is how the usbc case for the airpods 2 wont be available as a standalone purchase Sucks for those of us who bought the 2nd generation and now have to either keep a lightning cable on hand or swallow another 249 pair of airpods
cant upgrade this year its just ridiculous they took a year for nothing but type c charger
New Iphone lets see whats new  zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Nothing interesting as usual 
which camera are you using here 011
The Pro Max bump is to make a fake new feature ProRes 4k since last year it was only 256 and above  Similar to the watch tap thing which is a current accessibility feature Oh Apple
the 13 Mini is still better than these  Where is my 13 Army
Im confused my iPhone 12 Pro doesnt take near 1 hour to charge I just use a fast charging box I also dont see a back glass
USB C loooooooool forced by European union
Just see the numbersApple is still the GOAT 
033 Saying the quiet part out load LOL AKA Zero innovation
for tech I only watch u
Tell me youre tired of apple without telling me youre tired of apple 
Apple was forced to use USBC by the European community wasteeco so yes all new products will be USBC Crazy to see how Apple is now suddenly launching promo videos about Mother Earth whilst they needed to be forced in court
Apple gave yall USBC without fast chargingWags finger 
For the past 5 years or even more depending on the brands usbc
Same old same old
I have a 12 Pro Max and I dont see myself getting a 15 of any sizestyle Probably will just wait for the 16
Apple being forced by uk gov to switch by 2024 must of made em not fully get all they could out of usb c
"So basically unless regulators hadnt said to Apple remove lightning and replace with USB C then there would be literally zero innovation with this phone 
I think they need to really push on with this phone now and make the huge step change that they did when creating iPhone 1"
You are amazing
Most of those features have been mainstream used on android phones 
Watching this on my folding samsung phone just feeling bad for iPhone users
Im getting one in hopes that the camera is better
Thinking about it Watching videos like yours to get the lowdown
looks like im keeping my iphone 14 pro for another 23yrs at least lol
Good job Finally someone evaluating the iPhone 15 honestly
When battery test will be available
USB C isnt a feature in the same way a screen and a battery arent features Why do we give apple credit when they have done nothing but slow phone development since the iphone 4 We literally consider a headphone jack a feature because apple made the garbage decision to get rid of them and everyone else followed suit Lets also not forget they were legally forced into this decision apple doesnt give a shit about you and didnt do this for the customer they either use usbc or lose the entire EU market The moment they can fuck you over again by removing ports entirely they will But give them credit pretend its a feature
Upgrading for sure I dont care throwing away my hard earth  anyway All I care about is being on top of every new iPhone models anyway
If i was to buy it i would want it to look different from the previous phones
Yawn same old boring iPhone  nothing new  next
I wish the Pro came in the pink dammit
It is clear now that you can not call yourself a techie if you still usewant a iPhone
But apple uses type c from 2018 on ipads pro why do i hear a lot of people talk about it
Great video You knew exactly what we all wanted to hear All the accessories product nuances will come later whats new about the iPhones Now we know  1034 Im definitely one whos mad excited that you can default to a specific focal length  so often I need to pull my phone out and record or take a picture within seconds and having to change settings can make me miss the shot Having this already able to be automated with focal lengths on top of the new action button is just a sigh of relief coming from 11 pro  Cherry on top software addition 
  my s9 plus has a type c a lil late 
Since when apple gives us all the features Next year bigger battery faster charge bigger price
Again no INNOVATION from Apple Missing Jobs craziness 
Is it worth to upgrade from a 12 Pro Max to the 15 Pro Max Im not a hardcore photographer but I do post on social media apps and like taking pictures of things I feel like should be captured Other than that Im pretty basic with my phone Text browse the internet and shop and occasionally play a game
Do they come with sim tray or not
Yay now someone can tell Apple to go fix that mess with the 1st gen Apple Pencil
I wish I could get the 14 Pro Max again But in 512 GB capacity vs the 256 GB I bought a year ago
i think he is already recording this video with the iphone 15 pro max 
Ipones in use for many years and it is not good for the battery to charge it faster slower is better becuase it perserves battery life for longer time
Yeah the main problem is if you dont spend 60 bucks on an Apple Certified USBC then itll charge sooo slow
once ive gotten my music on the phone i wont care about usbc and even then itll likely be done wifi And interestingly i feel like i cant justify the extra cost of the pro One i like the mute button and miss it on android phone so its fine the way it is I dont care about titanium im rarely gonna zoom plus i want more storage so im adding 100 on any phone anyways So i think its 15 regular for me and ill save the 200 difference Also im coming from a non 5g pixel 4a so a 15 is an upgrade I could care less about the ports Just happy to have easier mp3 syncing with itunes than on android cause i got 150 gb of music i couldnt fit on a 128 pixel plus adding music was a pain
I really just want the T9 dialer capability Ive made my peace with everything else
That action button setting menu feels so skeuomorphic and out of place in the allflat Settings app
It really annoys me to know that apple resisted on making iphone usbc then it was forced to do it and they basically now sell it as innovationvalue to their customers If it was so obviously beneficial they shouldve done it long time ago Profits before customers always
I didnt expect thunderbolt speeds with the usb this year If that happened they wont have something to add next year Features on the iPhone is a slow drip Its classic trickle down economics technology Same with fast charging
Looks boring same as old ones
I would like to see apple now embrase a dex mode
They pulled the MagSafe Duo and MagSafe Battery Pack from the store Im hoping that means theyll be back with USBC versions and not that theyve killed them for good Was looking forward to getting a USBC battery pack
For all that money glass should be sapphire back and front
Apple Watch double tap is grooming for Apple Vision Pro Disappointing Apple didnt tie in USBC with iPhone 15 ProMax as a tethered alternative to the Vision Pros battery pack Imagine taking pictures with your 15 ProMax while wearing Vision Pro The debut clips of Vision Pro shown at Wanderlust event were repetitive and predictable
Apple  We make the old new again
"I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max 

I was really looking forward to an upgrade this year But now Ill wait for iPhone 16 Ultra My phone is zippy and perfect I want a new look"
Beautiful
Titanium isnt stronger or really harder than steel and is in fact more brittle its only lighter the reason people think of titanium as strong is because it is strong for its weight so in engineering applications more can be used for the same weight allowance making the product stronger overall but with the same volume of material like here stainless steel is the stronger of the materials
all iphones are lame get an android lol
The base models having USB C ports wiring USB 20 speeds is very anti consumer
Thanks for the quick informative review Moving to USBC is definitely a drawback because of its durability the lightning port is so durable and It almost never breaks down
That action button  It could have had four styles of inputs Hold click once click twice Click thrice Just like the old home buttons
The fact that I saw an iPhone advertisement when I clicked on this video
Cant wait for the exchangeable battery design 2027 EU law
So they did completely  nothing except add more ram  having that amount of ram on iPhone is useless
ANKER L Time to get my data stolen
I bet theres still no charger included with it
No fast charging I have been all wireless for years I charge my 13 pro max every day and a half or so who cares if it take an hour and a half in a pinch I use the car charger Charge speed it kinda a non issue for most people15 pro max looks great to me the action button for magnifier sounds great to me as a half blind man camera looks great too
Its just a 14 pro but slightly better chip and usb c
"I want one just for sideloading

Nvm lost me 800 dollars Im sticking with my 12 mini"
Im looking to upgrade from a 13 Pro to a 15 not Pro and have investigated how good the 3X camera really is A 48mp could be digitally cropped to a 12mp ie 4X My 13 Pro 3X camera image seems to be combined with the 1X  image cover a camera while at 3X and youll see a blown out image So is the 15 all I really need to match a 13 Pro for zoom alone
Another underwhelming iPhone release
Sooo what happens when the whole world moves away from USB C
Bro ur mic hiss is killing my ears  
Poor iphone fans I had a shaving machine with USB Type C 4 years ago
Camp the bland corporate non creatives at Apple now rule Innovations is dead
Bring back 3D touch
Meanwhile samsung and other brand introduce to foldable 
Im curious if secret back apple logo touch button still works on iPhone 15 pro
See I would get one but I just got my S23 so 
If they will give all the features at once how will they launch a phone every year and evoke excitement
So is it worth the jump from iPhone 13 to the 15 or should we just wait a good couple of years
If they keep that disgusting button over the Silent switch Im not buying any more iPhones 
6 million views in a day hardwork and dedication pays
Think Ill just get a iPhone 13 
It would be perfect if the new button could be used in games
Would be interesting if upgrading from an iPhone 11 is worth it or if a 14 pro would also be great
Im not jealous of the series 9 The series 8 has everything I need Im not jealous of the series 9 The series 8 has everything I need Im not jealous of the series 9 The series 8 has everything I need
IPhone is iPhone No one can beat this powerful phonevery smooth performance
glad the EU made them use the USBC
2 things Ive been complaining about have been fixed 1 midnight black is the worse color ever 2 super chrome looking edges to the pro models make it look awful in my opinion Both of these have been fixed I am planning on upgrading from my iPhone 12 mini to 15 pro I want to see that natural titanium color in person but im leaning towards that
Nice coverage kinda disappointed with the Anker sponsorship
Wrong info about the Pro main 48mp sensor being larger now I know they said that in the presentation but they meant larger than the nonpro 15 If you look at the specs both the 14 Pro and 15 Pro have the exact same 48mp same sensor with 244um pixel size Exactly the same sensor as before The UW and tele are also exactly the same as before only software improvement
Basically is 1200 USD not 1100 USD still expensive and the action button is something I saw many years ago on an android phone 
548 plugging in your phone and transfering is ass due to the file system sucking and backups not really being a copy and paste thing
The phone can now run complex algorithms for better prediction on customer journey behaviour science app penetration Better camera means better data collection of our faces every 2sec from front camera
They didnt change anything stop buying the new IPHONE
Its slightly embarrassing for the US that it has taken the EU to strike down what was the thunderbolt cable an abhorrent example of totally mercenary anticonsumerism that had no purpose or reason to exist other than to tax users of Apple devices
Ill wait for 16
Still got my iPhone 11 tbh and its fine except the battery so if anything Ill prob just get iPhone 14 cos the 15 doesnt seem that different to cater for
Its Just USBC
Dont Bother stick with your IPhone 13 or 14  Save your money  Im actually sticking with my 14 then going to a Different Maker sick of Apple  Nothing new these days Steve Jobs would be ashamed
"iPhone 5 supports USB C 20
iPhone 5 pro supports USB 30

Why the hell iphone15 isnt support USB 30"
Im using the 12 mini and Im not planning to switch 
640 its so they can reinvent fast charging next year and get clowns to wanna upgrade from 15 pro 
Knowing mkbhd and mrwhosetheboss are in the same country and state makes me wish for an in person collab soon
Iphone 12 pro max still running strong besides the weaker capabilities of the battery over the years its pretty much the same iphone Sticking to this one until they get rid of the notchisland to make a full screen iphone 
Dont care
Same shit different price
Not a apple guy Android all day Apple locks everything down The usb type c is long overdue You know how many of my apple friends would say  hey do you have a charger 
I have the iPhone pro 12 cant wait for the iPhone pro 27 totally redesigned
Im definitely camp I dont care  Im still using my IPhone13 pro max and planning to use it for the next two years or so
"Dont know if this is for the phones too

My wife has a Macbook pro with USB C and when I use my regular chargers on it it doesnt work

It has to be an Apple USB C charger

Im wondering if they sneakily did this with the phones as well Seem like something Apple would do"
15 pro would have been way better with 240hz screen and 15 having 120hz
and still no pro motion dispolay on the nornal Iphone Not even 90Hz Disappointing and at this point Switching to Android
Yall youtubers are interesting other than the phone this is the fastest Ive seen youtubers upload videos on the same day 
If I  make the action button custom can I still hold it to put my phone on silent
Thunderbolt Fast charging They have to have something to upgrade for the iPhone 16 
100 get a pro for the first time
Hi Marques
They finnaly went back to the iPhone 5 body
You need Courage to Launch same Phone everyyyyyyyy Year
Comments dont seem to be mentioning that Apple did not want to implement USBC and would have avoided it if they could have and continued to force people to use their own stupid cables Theyve done this because the EU forced them to and it wouldnt make sense costwise for them to manufacture one product for Europe and another for the rest of the world Europe just made everyones lives easier and reduced needless waste
Default camera focal length perfect for street photographers I suppose
yep guys its the same shit its the same phone as the 14pm i think imma hold onto mine until 2028 at least 
"So in summary basically as usual INCREMENTAL changes borrringgg borrring and no replaceable battery and more restrictions if you do not buy the PRO USBC is welcome although transfer and charging speed sucks across the board still or yet again Go ahead and do a backup of a 256GB or more size iPhone and count the time it takes to do sohmmmm where is the Apple that provides what users asking for Oh sorry Apple KNOWS better what I wantwhat Is that mens people are just straight dumb  stupidhmm I thought I should know what I want isnt that

BTW my iPhone and iPad are already starting to slow down typical Apple tactic to make me annoyed and buy new iPhone Guess what Apple you piece me one more time like this and that is the last time I buy iPhone or iWhatever I hope I am not the only one like this about Apple"
Photographer using a phone for work Hahaha hardly
Imagine having usb c and still only 20v while others have 80 and more oh gosh
Watching this on my fold and still disappointed with apple different year same problem with apple Only 110 people switch do they must be doing something right
With usbc itll be cool if you could dock it for monitor keyboard and mouse support
Squeezing fans of their Apple to the last drop
USB C being such a big deal is the ultimate reason why Apple users lit pay the company to alienate them
I wont buy this India made cow dung iPhone
I went to android and got the s23 ultra instead Another boring year of apple not innovating anymore basically a 14 pro max with titaniumusb c updated zoom and less bezels Not exciting at all And I was a apple person for years Not worth it to me
What about the battery Good or bad 
Is there any reason to upgrade This is so disappointing Even just aside from the minimal changes to the internal hardware the Pro colors are even more boring than before and they took the clean metallic shine off the border from the 14 lineup
V helpful video
Can ANYONE please tell me how long the charging time is for the iPhone Because the OnePlus chargers SO much faster
iphones are a joke
"Why is no one saying that apple just changed to usbc because of the EU  
So technically the only big change is something they had to do to sell ther phones in EU countries"
I genuinely didnt think theyd bring the Dynamic Island to the base iPhone 15 but I guess Apple was high and decided to forget screwing over the customers
I just left Apple and happy as ever not looking back You will see how much MORE freedom you have by leaving apple
Too hard of a sale for me already at 14 Pro USB C is nice but not necessary I like the shell change but doesnt effect my daily usage Wish there was really a new feature for me to gawk at and jump on board for Nice additions but nothing to really push adoption from the latest few iphones
ugh who cares
For a boring new product he is so polite So Apple is once again making a new version that is so incremental that a neutered USB C port is a big news item BORING
If youre still taking 2 hours to charge  shame on you 
the ONE to rule them all
What an incredibly revolutionary device Usb c more comfortable grip different colors Wow  Apple is moving at a break neck pace here I dont think any other company can keep up this level of innovation
Ehhh great phone if you need a phone but lets be real If you have a working 11pro then still no reason to really upgrade unless your current phone has issues
I cant believe you flew out for that bullshit
Are we going to ignore that they quoted him during the event How awesome is that
It blows my mine on the charging thing he said it takes a hour to hour in a half to full charge I have a 14 pro max my first iphone sense the x my phone charges 0100 in less than 40 minutes every single time its never once taken more than 40 minutes ever So im lost on who has this issue that i dont lol is my phone on crack or something
Anker good products bad practices
"WOW
55 Million views in 14hrs
Including ME But wait I Havnt watched this video Youtube says I have  but I have not Hmmmm "
Im on 13 pro so really isnt much of a upgrade for me unless I go for the pro max only
Need to lower some high end and slightly on tbe mid frequencies on the mic
Do they still make progress I doubt it Obviously not
What was your thoughts about the USBC on the iPhone when you first heard about it
"Man this crap couldnt be more meh Watched it live meh Spoke about it with friends meh Seeing this review meeeeehhhhh

Minor upgrade USB c cool nothing else is"
Buy a new phone every 34 years
Apple is over The simply cant innovate since the leave of John ivy
For content creators on the Pro Max  one of things I am excited about will be being able to record directly to an external ssd drive This will save a bunch of time editing and keep those files off the actual phone I know a lot will not use this but professionals will
Mkbhd boring Android is better because I can customize it Grow up Marques 
Crazy how u dont know the story for us to have these phones Cobalt Look that up its slavery
105 ONE PIECE
I wish phones would innovative something other than the cameras USB isnt really an it
Whats better a port or a mag
Im just glad iPhone users will be able to go to the dollar store to get a charger when theyre in a pinch
This might actually make me convert
I will definitely keep my 13 Pro Max for another year
15 pro max always wait 23 years between iphones for a much bigger upgradeupdate
Um like you were REFERENCED in an Apple Keynote I am beyond proud of you man One of my first five subs on YouTube many moons ago
Gotta love how Apple entice people with small changes every year and get people to spend over 1100 to get a phone with maybe 1 or 2 upgrades The marketing is unmatched
we are tired of this  we need another Steve Jobs to shake up this industry I dont see any reason to upgrade at all but hey Apple is smart they are gonna slow my 14 version so that I can upgrade
Peak iPhone   who cares anymore
"I think Apple is making 200 profit from each product especially Iphone
Evil company"
I was hoping to be  impressed by the new launch this year Im really not I also dont think I can afford a new iPhone right now Plus my 13 is still working great I have one of those Anker chargers I love it It charges my phone so quickly
Action button isnt a new feature at all because Samsung been having it
Theres still an enormous elephant sitting at the top of the screen there
i wonder if the action button will have mappable inputs ie double tap vs double click then hold vs triple tap would open up a LOT of usability doors with it
20 watts That was in NOKIA age wtf Apple
I really like the new button my mute switch is perpetually off so I dont lose any function by changing it to something else
me seeing the dude who admired ur camera in  background on tiktok
thank you EU
iPads already had USB C
More Adapters will be on demand
USB C was exactly what I was waiting for tbh I only use my lightning for the power beats pro  why did they ever do that
"Its just a shame that the regular 15 dont have 120hz refresh rate on the display 
Those are literally the 14pros display panels but programmed to stay put at 60hz like a five years old phone"
949 physical flashlight button 
 Its funny because when apple people upgrade theyre just getting the exact same phone They already had  No honestly last year me and my friend went and got new phones He had the iPhone 13 Pro max Gray model he got the iPhone 14 pro max Gray model Same amount of storage same amount of Ram It didnt even look like he upgraded Why didnt you get a different color or something It doesnt even look like you got a new phone it looks like The same phone you already had if i Wasnt there and watched him literally open up the new phone I wouldnt have believed He actually upgraded He got the same phone all the way around Then when he poured it off his shit over he was still out of storage All that for a slightly faster processor which they slow down After 6 months anyways and every Update After So whats the fuss about
Apple is starting to become garbage Same phone every year
Yo marques you must have felt really proud of all the work youve done up to date seeing how your comment was one of the key comments in the key note 
I was not satisfied
so no fast charging and base models at usb 20 IPHONE HAS BEEN AT USB 20 SPEEDS THIS WHOLE ASS TIME lmao
Whatever happened to the iphone ultra
honestly as someone whos frustrated with my pixels battery life and refuse to use samsungs software again the addition of usbc is all i need for incentive to switch
Nothing new under the sun Ill keep my money 
Still 60hz on the stanard iphone is criminal Come on apple seriously
Im sure apple dont have any respect for customers
Did they scrap the idea of the red colour for the 15 pro max  Didnt see the red varient for 15 pro max in the event
should i get the base model iphone 15 or get the 14 pro
USB C with usb 2 speeds apple always sucks and their fans suck harder
so its the same bullshit like last year get it
Everyone thank the EU for the USB upgrade and Boo apple for finding a way to monopolize the feature 
Currently running a 13pro this still doesnt look like a big enough upgrade Guess Ill get the 16pro
Maybe Im too immersed in the Apple world Didnt realize the usbc is such a big deal vs Lightning
I just wonder what those phone body designers at Apple do all year  must be the easiest job ever 
i love how at 903 you can see Arun from Mrwhosetheboss
Not to be that guy but I remember when my HTC One M8 could do the focus selection and depth data on a photo in post8 years ago
Welcome to Android
Peak iPhone
a button instead of a toggle how revolutionary apple lol and the island in todays standards is just not acceptable ruins the screen completely
"iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max should have Thunderbolt 4 USB 30 on iPhone Pro is a missed opportunity
I suspect Apple wants to bring out TB4 in the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max to make Pro users upgrade every two years
iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are likely to have three 48 MP camera sensors"
still rocking with my iPhone 8 Desires never end
I hope you can change the quick button action based on your focus mode
Actually titanium isnt stronger than steel but it is lighter It is stronger than aluminum though
Nope actually was holding out for a price drop on the 13 mini but now they are just dropping it completely 
People work at Apple factory escaping due to harsh condition still ripping off customers
Regular iPhone 15 is the same as iPhone 14 pro so to say that iPhone 15 is not a pro that means that iPhone 14 Pro was not true pro phone 
A button a new chip and USB C Hardly feels new does it
you still cant hide the icons and you still cant change icons So am staying with Android
I was expecting something different this time in my opinion the iPhone 14 pro series did better last year when it comes to new features and new style But this time is really disappointing
Are we really getting excited about USB C now I understand that they reached the peak as far as innovation goes but to talk about these new iphones with the same level of excitement as when they used to bring a revolutionary new feature is just ridiculous
The Action button is something that Android has been using with their power button or any other button for years now  Whats new about it
wow  i honestly dont think that i can care for this company one bit
I chose the Samsung Note Ultra because of the 5x optical zoom Glad to finally see Apple add advanced optics
MKBHD Im in Camp 15 Pro Max its been a good run and I feel that I made the right decision to hold out I have an iPhone 12 Pro Max there was no need to go to 13 and 14 was exciting but not enough to make me jump the jump from 12 to 15 will be jampacked and the cost remains in the same ballpark 
Im on the 12 and historically upgrade my phone after 4 years this is the first ill make it 1 year earlier Usually waiting for 3 models or 4 later you will feel the difference but not every year
And so every cable and charger we bought and stored for when the previous break cause these iPhone cables brake so easily everyone of them will need to be thrown in the garbage with changing the phone this year  Great NOT
Why cant Apple make the perfect iPhone Money My perfect phone wishlist One the size of the phone should go back to iPhone 4 The conversation port should be the fastest USBC make the phone thicker for more battery camera should have good detail to capture text from a book and zoom enough to read text from far away Prosecutor should be good enough that I dont notice it thinking to hard And memory large enough so I dont have to think about deleting things from my phone Oh and Apple please make it easier to put my photos on to an external memory drive I go through like so meany steps just to get my photos on to usb drive This last one might be a skill issue
I am totally in only because I have a 11 pro max that will be replaced this year Upgeading from 14 models to 15 is pointless as usual
IPhone needs to change up the product get a folding phone
The cynic in me believes that they didnt add things like fast charging so that they can make incremental improvements in each generation to encourage upgrading ones phone rather than using them same model for several years
Honestly its disappointing that they are still dragging their bums with regards to major changes Apple have it rigged slowly dripping changes and getting users to pay more  Cant wait for the removable batteries
Coming from my current iPhone X this is gonna be a massive upgrade
I bought the 13 Pro Max a while back and while I have no complaints I realized afterwards that I definitely just got wrapped up in the hype  I think I took all of maybe 10 photos and videos at the most lol  I generally just use it to text call peruse Reddit etc  Im just gonna get something cheap next time around
As an Android user the thing Im most excited about are the EarPods with USBC
Its the same phone like last year
I use my iPhone with Word Outlook  Citrix via the HDMI convertor bluetooth keyboard and mouse If I use the USBC connection on my monitor to a 15 Pro Max will I get 4K Can I also recharge 15 Pro Max at the same time
if they wanted to put usb 3 into their iphones they could have done that with lightning lightning supports and has used usb 3
Iam using 65 watts charging phone for last  three years still it has good battery backup its an IQOO phone still awesome
Ad was L
You guys are also sold to Applethose idiots every year fool everyone and you guys help them USBC is also history and they are bringing it in now after getting kicked on their butts by EU Shameless basds Notch still and they called it Dynamic Island to hoodwink everyone I have both Apple and Android phones but i dont support Apple greed for money Their phones are good but display needs improvement as their 120 Hz scrolling is nowhere as fast as Androids
They should make it so the action button can be double or triple pressed for different actions
I feel like upgrading for a 12 Pro Max to the 15 Pro Max is worth it
Yeah Im done with Apple Billion dollar company and they give us crumbs
Marques I like your enthusiasm but when you have to point out that a new phone has a rounded edge as a big change you are grasping at straws All that matters is the usbc port otherwise its the same phone as last year
"This pretty uneasy for me that a company has been so locked into its own ecosystem or environment of features specs that even if seemingly simple features like ucb c that too without fast charge or reduced data speed can cause such huge headlines 
Just a thought"
 but pretty much just USBC
What about CarPlay US cars still dont have USBC as a standard
Year 2023  and the biggest Company on the planet tells you in an fancy ad that their new 1000 phone has USB2Speed  and how proud they are to present you USB3Speed in their 1400 phone WTF D
We need to have USB 30 speeds on the the iPhones and Thunderbolt 5 speeds on the iPhone Pro models in the future
wow
Im in camp RIP Mini
terima kasih buat uni eropa karena regulasi kalian akhirnya memaksa apple untuk menggunakan USB C untuk perangkat iPhone
that frame doesnt look as nice as the iphone 14
Love your videos Marques Totally gonna get one Im on a 12 Pro and looking for the 15 Pro Max because of the camera
If they dont change to USBC theyll banned in the EU countries so they had to
You are literally the best expert  reviewer  advisor on the net You style and personality are amazing You speak tech but every you say makes sense Thanks
So now it takes government legislation to force Apple into making a change to the iPhone
apple sucks since jobs died no innovation whatsoever 
Next generation portrait You could do exactly the same thing from pixel 6 onwards 
Got an iPhone 12 and wanted to change when apple had usb c Is it worth changing to one of the 15s or wait another year
Next year when they release with fastcharging itll really make the iPhone all round top of the line smartphone
i think we the community and youtubers need to call apple out on this one  They could have easily give USB 30 Speed on both iphone and pro models but they just did not  Because they have nothing else to be called a PRO feature Imagine if Samsung or Xiaomi had done something similar the tech youtube community would be very furious and would not recommend their phones But apple always gets a pass We deserve better
Bro watch Shazams review from Kerala Mansilayo 
I know it doesnt seem like a big deal He kind of just glossed over it in this video I dont thing people understand how big it is that the pro phones are capable of running PC caliber games If they can get more developers porting their pc games This is competitive with things like the steam deck Thats insane to me that a PHONE is doing this
Same dam phone 
Govt regulations made them switch to USB C
Apple definitely didnt impress me with this iPhone 15but great review tho
Should i keep my 13 pro max or upgrade to 15 pro max  decisions I actually like my phone feeling heavier
My main issue is why did the trade value go down When I traded in my iphone 12 pro max for the 13 pro max I got 970 back from apple and last year I got 920 back for my 13 pro max when I got the 14 pro max So why is it this year Im only getting back 650 for the iphone 14 pro max when I want to trade it in and get the 15 pro max
Apple really
I really wanted to like this phone but fast charging being nonexistent is a deal breaker for me
What about the refresh rate on iPhone 15 
have been using an iphone 8 pretty much since it came out so heavily considering upgrding this year its just a bit underwhelming tbh other than being faster slightyl better camera system and usbc the 15 pro doesnt seem like a massive jump from the 14 pro maybe im wrong but it just doesnt seem like apple put much effort into the phone lmao
How do you get it for 799 I see its price 969 minimum for the normal Iphone 15
The only thing i envied about iphone users was air drop but whatsapp resolved that too with their recent hd update tata bye bye wont buy one in this lifetime
Im still rocking an IPhone XS Max Ill probably get a regular IPhone 15 plus seeing as I dont see the need for the pro models other than a look at me for spending x amount of more money Or potentially switch to Samsung
Honestly with the new base 15 line up theres really no reason to even get the pro phones anymore The titanium is cool and all but everyone uses a case so it doesnt really matter The bigger camera is cool but you dont need a 5x camera to take pictures of your kids or hobbies etc etc the base phones are now basically on par with last years pro phones at almost half the cost so it doesnt make much sense to even go for the pro models this year
At this point should I just go to android
Is it just me or does MKBHD doesnt come down as hard on apple as he does on android phones for lack of innovation I dont see any innovation from apple if you look at the last 2 to 3 years i feel he is on apples paycheck
No fast charging is absolutely ridiculous And intentional Stay tuned this time next year
541 USB 3 its not a benefit of USB C It has nothing to do with it USB 3 is a version of the USB interface while the USB C its just the physical connector You can have the benefits of a USB 3 interface using a USB A connector You can even have USB 1 interface using a type C connector
"they focused so miuch on a stupid stuff like saving earth
we want to see new products who cares about fucking earth"
"535 Hey Marquees this makes a lot of difference My workplace uses exclusively iPhones for its clients and I have to backup and restore iPhones as a part of my job this is a huge deal for me Not to mention that Apple gives you only 5GB of could backup for free so yeah I think you grossly misunderstand the needs of iPhone users and you use yourself as example of an average user which is simply not the case
Just FYI I plugged in an iPhone just yesterday"
What you guys think about Olivia Rodrigos new music video thats shot from an iPhone Its a yay or nay
As you know I dont have a case cause I have two dozen free phones 
Thank you European Union
Probably not going to upgrade from my 13 Pro just yet might wait for the midyear fun color refresh or for the 16 Probably the latter since if I recall that was on the road map for reducing the face ID pill cutout to just a circle for the front camera
Why didnt they bring a stylish pen
cannot wait for the iphone 20
My man was quoted onscreen in a slide at an official Apple event in front of the whole world Incredible
apple fell off
wish they made a mini Ill prob get the 13 mini now
Im still doing okay with my iPhone 7 thanks 
MKBHD finally got some well deserved recognition from Apple congrats 
Theres nothing new Even the CPort has been used already in other phones
Oh nice the iPhone 12 version 3 is now USB Still sticking with Android Once you go Samsung you never go back
The 15 Pro Main Camera Chip is the same size as last year They said its a bigger chip than the regular 15
The action button can be easily bumpedlong pressed by mistake while it was much more difficult for a physical switch
When will they change the camara layout
I have a iPhone 14 promax and I want to change it to the 15 not much difference
23rd iphone is crazy
Wonder how Iphone 99 pro will look like
Yawwnnanother iPhone  so what
Not really worth it if you are coming from 12  12 Pro  Max  later models
Another disappointing Apple event I will continue to stick to my 13 Pro until they at leat remove that infamous dynamic island Not to mention how lame the new Apple watch is that is so nobody is even talking about it
Not mute silent
"This is better than the Apple keynote itself 

I read that the Pro charging speed is now 35w instead of 27w Marques you said 20w  or is that something else"
Great vid thank you for sharing Its time to ditch my trusty 6s with headphone jack for the 15 pro max
I love to watch all your tech vids MKBHDKeep up the good work  wish I could of afford the new iPhone
USBC on an iPhone so sick Apple7 years late to the party
This was an awesome update I was stoked about the preset to specific focal lengths even though I recognize not everyone will care or understand why Focal length is more than just zoom and cant be replicated by simply cropping the image Different focal lengths are preferred for creating different effects and a 35mm focal length is pretty standard for interviews and portraits The preset is a nice way to allow people with different preferences to quickly engage in the ways they want to
201 it is a thumb or a shin
Apple should take the depth information from spacial video and use it to shift the focal length in post Then you can get ultra wide field of view but without the distortion
No fast charging What does that mean
FYI about the USC C change New rules in EU about USB C Apple is getting ahead of the compliance deadline  EU sets December 28th 2024 deadline for all new phones to use USBC for wired charging
iPhone 8 here and still going strong  Cant lie that the cameras are remarkably better than back then An upgrade may be on the horizon
"I just traded in my iPhone 11 Pro Max for a 14 pro max about a month ago and I already want to switch to the next one Mainly for the new finish and the new chip I am curious how much lighter the 15 is cause the going from 1114 there was a hefty weight change

If anything Ill stick with my 14 but Ill buy a series 9 watch since I currently have the series 5"
I almost fainted at hearing the prices Why does Apple charge so much for their phones and devices It one my biggest reservations about getting an iPhone at any point in time that and then forcing you to send in a phone to Apple to get it repaired which costs far more than if you could just do it yourself If they want me to get an iPhone theyre going about it the complete wrong way
Been waiting Replacing an 11PM with the 15PM Shoot video and this thing will be my main rig for corporate gigs Still have DSLRs that Im happy to retire
I dont believe that Apple got blackmailed and changed to USB C 
Eh Ive got a 14 might go Android until the 15
Camp Dont care at all why u here guys 
damn  that phone must be shiz
Aside from the USBC port which is definitely awesome not really much else super gamechanging IMO Ill probably be upgrading from my iPhone 12 Mini just for the larger screen  the latest phone iPhones at this point have become insanely similar where its just not worth upgrading yearly for pretty much everyone
Makes me laugh  The green thing and Mother Earth and they fly you all in
Im okay Im happy with my 14 pro max Ill wait till iPhone 20 lol
Same phone different port Lmao
Idk when the last time you plugged your phone in to transfer data was lol yeah cause Apple made it a pain in the ass
Did you and Arun shared your scripts with each other
"Ill wait for the 16th or 17th  edition
Just the same phone  
1200  Get get me a new laptop 
A used car a gold solid chain which will hold value a diamond  many things"
104 Its real
Gunna hold out for Apple vision
To go pro or pro max
Im in camp I want the 15 pro max but my 13 pro still works fine and Im a broke college student so I cant justify 1200 on a new phone right note Any one else No just me Oh okay
USB Type C  Steve Jobs is rolling over in his grave
Regular 15 still on 60hz
"I actually think the graphics performance is a fairly notable improvement mainly for what it might signal Apple showing off version of current console games running on an iPhone combined with their fairly unified architecture and UX and their recent push for Mac porting might imply theyre gearing up to angle themselves as a sort of platformbased Switch

In other words they might be trying to really push for the Apple ecosystem to be the be all and end all media center All your stuff on all your devices wherever you are Theyve already got music and movies games are the one big thing"
Gone buy a Max Pro same day it possible  Bought my 11 Pro Max when it came and its been working perfect all time and only down to 87 battery health 
In Switzerland we got a price drop for the standard iPhone 15 Models compared to last years iPhone 14 Models about 80 swiss francs less
Last year i said the 14 Pro would be my last iPhone purchase for a number of years given that phones have basically maxed out their capabilities However the lighter weight and softer edges are something I would prefer Ive always commented on how lightweight other phones felt and how heavy the iPhone felt in my pocket in comparison I know its not a HUGE deal but if I plan on keeping it for the next 34 years this would be the one id want USBC is nice as well seeing as everything else is USBC
Slick Action button eh Guess it was too much to add touchId in the power button like in the latest iPads 
Im still rocking my iPhone X and it has been an amazing phone Im considering the 15 ProPro Max Thanks for the video and looking forward to more content on this lineup in the future I suspect Ill notice an improvement coming from the X at least that is my hope 
"Im not impressed at all  

14 pro max vs 15 pro maxnot big differences between
Camerasreally Same 48 MP 
Helloknock knock anybody from Apple Just 48 MP  only The zoom 5x only
Front camera12 MPonly Is it 4k or 8k Hmmm I doubt
120 hzdid you hear about 165 hz
No gorilla glass Victus
How about batteryno infos so farwhy I can figure it out probably  same battery as the 14 has it
Sothumbs down

America make Iphone great againif you wanna be bought it Cheers "
14 pro users like here
will the base 15 models have 120 hz screens or nahhh
No fast charging  Hahahahah Apple is overpriced TRASH
The pro goes up to 1TBsurprised no one mentioned that
Its crazy how were on the 15 series but its camera is still weaker than Galaxy phones smh their ultra phone will always be the go to camera phone
Fuck that new button The click on is so satisfying when u put your phone on silent
I am happy with my iPhone 11 Pro for now lol
Jesus Marques looks at the new iPhone and gets millions of views and dollars
Much ado about nothing car would renew my interest in apple if that ever becomes reality
IOS is smooth
natural and black colors are looking nice
Samsung been using usb c for years This is so late for apple Apple is slow on new technologies
For the action button is it only for one action or you can do long press or doublesingle press type of stuff
Is the selfie camera 4k yet
I thought u will answer the question Is it really worth to upgrade
Isnt that shirt the Auto Trader logo
Looks like I may switch from S22 ultra  to iPhone 15pro
I cant wait for the usb pro res videoout to my atomos ninja for external recording This will be a huge time saver for me coupled with those faster transfer speeds
DopenessI got the dynamic island on my S22 running Niagra launcher and themed to my liking  Ive been on adroid since the G1the i15 pro might be my calling
Marques its ala min ium not aloominum  
Same shit different toilet Apple died with Steve
"Hi guys
Honor 90 vs Samsung S21 FE what to buy 
The camera is very importnat
Thanks"
Not sure if I should upgrade Coming from a 13 pro max 
Id be down for an upgrade
The notch is still ugly af how many years later now
iPhone fans get a feature and try to push it as a Apple breakthrough 
I dont know why they are selling the physical SIM models here in the USA and secondly even those with the physical SIM cards slot can still use the eSIM so why not ditch this eSIM only and idea and have the phone have both capabilities of the physical SIM slot and the eSIM
"i think we can all agree that this event was flat but the real highlight was seeing Marques Brownlee front and center on the powerpoint presentation
Get ride of Dynamic Island and ill upgrade"
Definately camp dont care at all
They should change buttons position before its hard to turn off the screen without taking screenshots
I have the iPhone 11 think Im going to hold off till at least the 16 yet I dont think there are enough big changes to warrant getting a new phone right now But when I do upgrade will most likely be to the pro models
These Apple events and releases have been pretty underwhelming for the past 7 releases or moreIm waiting on people to realize that there is ZERO reason to upgrade because only then when their bottom line is threatened will Apple actually feel compelled to actually do something innovative
If usb C is the main thing this year for the IPhone it must say something  I still think a lot change since Steve Jobs Wonder what his thoughts wouldve been
So basically iPhone 14s 
"Ive never been comfortable using an android phone
Guess everyone is comfortable with something"
A useless phone not really anything different again and theyre only adopting usb c for eu laws
Astonishing how late Apple adopts things
Can we see a video on the Pixel 8
really disappointed by the watches this year
The big headline is NOT usb c connector it is the utter contemp it was done with The 15 is USB 2 Which means not faster than their last port So a 20 year old usb You have to buy pro for usb3 Well done apple lol
great review   and LOVE ANKER great products
Its super annoying that Ive spent so much on apple tech and I will have to mess around with loads of cables again some for my lightning items and some for USBC
USB 3 is ancient by this point 10 GB per second isnt bad but the USB 32 has 40GB per second speeds so Big woop
I wonder what the iPhone would be like today if Steve Job was still here Serious question
"Great video as usual but lets be real  This was disappointing stuff 

My job pays for my new phone and I was gonna get a Iphone Pro 15 but its so underwhelming im seriously considering Android choices"
Why dont you ever chapter your videos
Its the s23 apple as usual light years ahead
apple is just being straight up disgusting at this point
Cant wait for next years iPhone full screen without cutout
Im watching this having never bought or will buy any apple product only watching cos its MKBHD
Keeping my 14 Promax
All I want is Touch ID back 
So is the 15 still stuck at 60fps and the pros get 120 bc if so im getting the pro lol
"What are you going to say about deteriorating speakers I have iphone 12max pro and I bought this in late 2021 Now my phone loud speaker are so bad that CAN NOT hear anything without airpods its so hard to have video FaceTime calls and audio call are hard to hear as well

Anyone got the same issue"
Been following MKBHD for God knows how long but seeing the growth of this channel and Marques is absolutely spectacular 
hey MKBHD the review was perfect but to me the new iPhones are not worth upgrading now specially using my iPhone 14 pro umm the only much difference is the USBC and the new action button that replaced the mute switch which is not a big deal to meso i think the 16 pro will be ideal
Im thinking Apples Peak is at its end The same typical phone with different chip names and small tweaks Also Im not planning on Apple to release desktop computers for Gamers While Apple is too busy focusing on pandering to rainbow cults and earthly friendly products other competitors are growing I think people now realize Apple is just boring and repetitive
Im bored
Imagine the Phone being made in India and its the most expensive in India compared to other countries Apple what logic is this Isnt it supposed to be cheaper than the rest of the world
You didnt cover the pro max only feature related to vision pro
S23 ultra
Sen anlatnca dilini anlamasam da ok keyifli izlemek Trkiyeden selamlar 
I can upgrade now from iPhone 3GS
Should i upgrade from iphone 11 to 15 this year or wait another year
My brother saw you today He sent me a 5 sec video of you 
Sticking to the s23 ultra Hopefully the 16 make me want to switch back
Its funny to see a Samsung ad on the iPhone video 
Ill wait next year before I upgrade
When is Pixel 8 coming 
Im in camp wish I could get it but I already have a 14 and having two wouldnt do me much good and Im probably too poor to afford one 
Thanks EU for forcing Apple to switch over to USB C
The new IPhone 15 Pro Max is just 7 grams lighter than the IPhone 12 Pro Max Definitely lighter than IPhone 14 Pro Max which is 12 grams fattier than the 12 
Booooorrrriiiinnnggg
why do people speak in Mbitssecond  just cause it sounds like its faster than it is once you get on a pc or a phone or whatever  everything is in MB  MegaBytes
So you get USBC with all the phones BUT you get all the benefits of C only on PROPRO MAX Seems like apple move to me
Getting one soon
Does it have a restart feature now It has been a long time since I had my first iPhone which I still have right now and noticed even with other iPhones that you cannot restart the unit like the Android phones
this is exactly what Ive been waiting for Cant wait to get my hands on a 15Pro
I usually upgrade my iPhone every 2 years and it seems like the smart choice again as this is a minor upgrade from the 14 Pro that I have Hopefully the 16 Pro will incorporate the 120mm lens and have some other meaningful upgrades
honestly the 13 pro max is the best iPhone evert had to trade my 14 pro max due to battery and had to buy back the 13 pro max its a real masterpiece 
That was an excellent review I cant believe I am just discovering you at this momentheading over the subscribe for you podcastYep I am getting the 15Pro I kept my 10XS waaaay too long
No fast charging to preserve battery life
Ah its great watching iPhone have to become more and more similar to android
Looking forward to seeing your review Doesnt seem like a mega improvement but itll probably feel nice coming from a 13 Mini
The one issue I feel the Apple always does to its consumers is restrict full use of their phones I mean they switched to USBC and charge a hefty premium for these phones and only 20 and 30 I mean Samsung has three phones a base model a plus and Ultra and yet the processors the USB speed is all the same Apple could have at least put USBC 3 in the 15 and 15 plus I mean I get that photo enthusiasts will definitely option for the iPhone 15 Pro Models but even with their limited transfer speed that makes the base model  slower which is what consumers have been complaining about they could have at least made the speed the same for all phones just because youre not a photo enthusiast doesnt mean you want a faster phone to transfer music or whatever I mean if youre not a big photo enthusiasts but you still like taking photos with a base model phone cuz thats all you can afford you should still be able to transfer into your computer at a decent speed And it kind if sucks that the 5x zoom is only on the pro max My wife is a big photo enthusiast taking great phones with her 13 pro but she has small hands and could not handle the pro max size So why shoukd she be penalized Im sure if Samsung made 2 ultra sizes the only difference would be size Not performance Apple clearly doesnt really listen to their customers all they want is the bottomline to make Agrippa money and I get it its a money maker company but if youve got customers complaining all the time Im a feature that should be standard then you should listen to your people like why havent they implemented RCS yet theyre still hindering technology with oldschool crap they claim theyre all about encryption and security of their users but yet falling back on SMS takes all that away from their users Android has the features now with RCS its just a quick little switch over they can still keep a lot of their iMessage exclusiveness trust me they wont lose customers to Android because of RCs and even if they do going to be very minimal
Dont care at all but watching the review to get a true review
Garbage phone  usb3 Wow what a beautiful news
So nothing new this year as well
After squeezing the life out of my 12 pro max the 15 pro will be substantial for me
Come on ppl stop doing this crap EVERY YEAR a New phone comes out and ppl continue to buy without offering any significant changes Do you really think that they could have done this for the Iphone14 come onnnnnnnn be smatter than that
35W charging on pro models Id call that quick charging
If anybody could help answer this it would be a great help Im an independent recording artist and I want to shoot my own music video on my iPhone Im due for an upgrade so Im deciding which iPhone to get I know the iPhone 13 has a great camera but tht the 14s software doesnt match up with its camera Is the 15 supposed to resolve that issue Basically my question is should I get an iPhone 13 or 15 for music videos
You cant have the whole lineup running usb 30 speeds when the bionic 16 doesnt support it Usb 30 is only on the A 17 pro chip
They did the shoutout so you take it easy on them lol its the same phone 
"Prophet
Muhammads Farewell Sermon delivered during his last pilgrimage he reiterated the principles of equality and racial harmony He stated There is no superiority for an Arab over a nonArab nor for a nonArab over an Arab Neither is the white superior over the black nor is the black superior over the whiteexcept by piety and good actions This sermon served as a comprehensive reminder of the importance of equality and the rejection of racial prejudice

This is Islam and the truth that the media and some groups dont want you to know"
Wow so it is just the exact same thing Whoever always buys these new phones man deserved to be ripped of
Wait so they are going to put fast charging in the next phone to give people a reason to upgrade again Apple is so greedy
Theyll probably give the base model usb3 next year and the pro will get thunderbolt
Why is apple charging 40 more in india Whats the point of globalization if the price difference is so big
Ever since I saw that matte finish on the 15 series I remembered marques talking about how he would love the matte finish on the base variants too Hey youre being heard
"Hey Marques great video and awesome that you got a shout out in the KEYNOTE that was epic

I am pumped about these upgrades myself

I currently run an iPhone 11 Pro Midnight Green 256GB and will be upgrading to the iPhone 11 Pro 25GGB probably in Black or Silver

As a small iPhone lover I really liked to hear that the Pro iPhones are substantially lighter this year AND smaller due to the very small bezel size this is amazing news and the fact the batterys are getting larger huge fan of long long lasting battery life

Also excited that more and more iPhones will have the Dynamic Island so hoping that more and more developers will use this in clever ways

I am also really looking forward to the new ACTION button as I NEVER liked the mute switch on the iPhone I was actually hoping for the longest time they would remove this mute switch in favour of just being able to mute your iPhone via a screen toggle But the action button does look cool"
Ive had androids Ive had iphones I switched to the zfolds for the bigger screen since Im visually impaired but the failure rate on the folding screens has been too high so Im looking to switch to a iphone 15 plus and an ipad mini for around the house Having type C is a big deal for me since Ive always hated having to keep multiple cables Itd a good time to switch and then Ill grt the new iPad mini 2h3n itd announced next year
So basically they just did what Europe made them do and change the adaptor to a universal standard  I honestly thought they were going to take the plug away and go mag all the way  Im happy I was wrong
I really dont see a reason to spend the extra 200 for the pro
"Dude seriously
You existed for this exact same iphone from three years ago
Oh right it has usb c now
Just because they been forced to put it on btw"
Importantto me question I was under the assumption that the focal lengths isnt merely a cropping effect like mkbhd mentioned I assumed that computational photography blah blah is used to change how the subject in the photo actually appears how it is distorted by the lenswith narrow lenses like wide angle making them appear narrowerlonger than real life and telephoto thicker Thats very important to me because I am really frustrated by smartphones making everything appear stretched out and further away than what I see when i take out the phone to record And its gotten even worse when I switched from iphone X to my current 12 I noticed how this effect is even more visible And newer models arent better in that regard Yeah you get more in the shot but it looks worse I really hope this is the solution to that and not just a crop
unless you have an iPhone 12 it makes absolutely no sense to upgrade to an iPhone 15 very minor and insignificant upgrades if you ask me Ill keep my iPhone 14 pro max until they make something worth buying
Apple should be thankfull towards the EU without their ban of lightning there would be absolutely no difference to the iPhone 14
Werent they already have the back repairability since the 12s Nothings changed they just brought it out late They are great at bringing stuff later at the right time to flow better with all the pro earth bibs
Totally getting the Pro in blue Gotta replace the good ol 12
now well get more usb c accessories from 3rd parties both for iphone and android phones
Im sure millions will buy it to tweet out how they demand higher wages climate action and BLM but ignore the fact that phone has a huge carbon footprint built by children in sweatshops with materials sourced through slavery in Africa
To the the people who were told last year wait a year Well wait another year or maybe 2 years 
"Hey marques Also this new spatial video recording feature might enable new VR Functionality for shooting 2D and 3D Videos compatible for VR OS apps in the future 

It can be interesting but not sure how developers will be able to use these features as a part of VR apps development"
Like he mentioned iphone only does things differently to be different but eventually they copy androids 
As a iPhone 14 pro user there is nothing here getting me going
Looks like a 13 When will Apple stop pushing the same old same old every year What happened to big leaps in features like the iphone 46 series I could be way outta pocket saying this but to the layman the 1015 series just seems stuck in big dejavu
"Dude is just an apple pro praises then even if they are making something bad 

The same if any other manufacturers does he will keep saying that again and again to drive buyers away from it"
I dont know not feeling it lets just embrace the apple bashing youll get more views 
Still have my iPhone 6s plus
Is iphone 15 still at 60hz or has it changed to 120hz
Hi you can ask an Apple representative on my behalf on what basis they provided the ray tracing result which is four times faster than A16 Bionic which did not support this function  thank you Waldek
Heres what I want to know about the Action Button and Siri Shortcuts Can I make it so if its a quick tap it will toggle one thing and if its a hold itll do something else Like hit it once and Im on Do Not Disturb or off but if I hold it I launch my camera Because thats what I want
Its fumny how apple was worried that they cant get rid of the outdated look of the front notch as it may affect the minimalistic design but has 2 or 3 rear cameras protruding off the panel and some times looks odd and actually looks uninspiring And they could not fit the reae cameras within the rear panel It shows how apple lost ideas about designing new iphones The front notch was unique from 2019 till 2020 and now android phones have the coolest designs and apple could have used those cool desogn elements and tried some thing unique to iphone itself By the way iphone is not expensive to me as i have 3 iphones xs max 11 pro max and iphone 13 pro till now and will wait and see for any new models after iphone 16
Map the action button to control HomeKit commands Pretty cool
Dont worry fast charging is coming next year and thunderbolt in 2025
They can add fast charging next year so they sell you a new phone 
They finally put a USBC on it because the EU told them to do it They try to act big but everyone knows they got put in their place
Cant wait for Techspurts review 
You really need to be harder on appleand all other companies you cover about being right to repair Doesnt matter what little thing they do forcarbon neutrality it still wont beat letting us just fix it ourselves
I mean its worth it for me but ONLY cause my XS is literally dying lol
So can the iPhone 15 be charged with an android charger
dont buy it nothing new in it just usb c  dont waste money
No sim card is an F
When Tim Cook quotes you  you know that you did something right in this life 
Can i get free iphone from you cus i realy realy cant pay for it at the moment 
Apple is deliberately holding back on USBC features so they can save them for the iPhone 16 The baseline 16 models will have the new USB 3 controller on the chip and the pro versions will have fast charging with Thunderbolt up to 40Gbs This years iPhone is more dipping a toe in the water as far as USBC goes Still 10Gbs is a huge upgrade from what pro users have had to put up with since iPhones existed but it was a shitty move not to include a USB 3 cable in the box
USBC was mandated by the European Union so what was Apple going to do make Lightning Port for the US and the rest of the world USBC
definitely upgrading my 13 pro max to the 15 version gonna love getting the 48mp camera w 5x zoom plus all the additions that 14 gave
Would have loved to see a built in screen finger print scanner Just something actually new and different other than a charging port
The new features and specs were disappointing and wont be a factor in my getting a new iphone USB3 speeds shouldve been included on all phones like Marques said  I need to upgrade from my 12mini only because the battery is getting old Maybe Ill look for a deal on a 13mini Apple really needs to get creative again
another copy paste from apple kekw
Im frustrated at the colour selection for the Pros Very drab and boring No gold red alpine green or burgundy
IPhone 142  
Damn I miss Jobs theres no innovation left at Apple
cant wait to throw all my lightning cables in the ocean
What a waste of money
Thinking about giving Apple a shot Ive had a OnePlus every year since the 3T but Ill be keeping my eye on the iPhone 15 Pro Max
been holding off till we got usbc super pumped
Cant wait till jerryrig teardown this thing especially the titanium series
Apple implement type C USB Make a big deal of it while android have it almost for almost 10 years 2014 to be exact Apple is just a ripp off Within the next 5 years Apple will meet the rock bottom They used to never disappoint their customer but eventually they started to disappoint more and more and more
Samsung Flip is destroying Apple
I think theres a different between a statistically better phone and reality For the last few iPhones the numbers say its better In reality on how I use the phone  they have been identical for years
51 million views in 13 hours You are a popular man
The only reason I like the iPhone 15 is just because I do have an older iPhone and need an upgrade I have an iPhone SE 2nd Gen and this a bigger upgrade than the 13 in my eyes
Apple wanna fckup European laws that forced them to change to usb c 
Is there going to be a new USBC wired headphone in the box for the new iPhone
1104 geraldundone sighting
USB C lol  Hello my old Samsung S6
You should check out the new Pro cameras especially in conjunction with Capture One and its ProStandard color profile
Marques  Im trying to get my mom and dad to watch your channel but they dont understand English Can you have a translation in Hindi
looks like a good year to skip my 14 pro max is feeling great
My trick to getting photos off the phone to windows pc and not using lightningiCloud use a Smart Switch app to transfer your photos and videos to an Android device And then transfer them using USBC with proper speeds Any other way is a nightmare done deliberately to upsell you to icloud
Who the hell cares about raytracing on an iPhone If I want raytracing Ill play on my pc lmao Nothing worth upgrading from a 14 pro clearly Steve Jobs would be really disappointed
Happy with my 13 mini that looks and runs like day one Ill wait another 23 years until I can justify spending the money
So can we finally switch off HDR for photos on the iPhone 15 Or are we still forced to look at fake looking sunsets
What are all the iPhone models If you know can you reply to this comment please
Hey bro Great job as always in terms of providing initial impressions Apple is seem to be falling behind when it comes to upgrading its technology Hoping to have some great updates that could possibly convince me to get the IPhone with A20 Pro chipset So I will wait until then lol 
iPhone peaked its getting old now seriously Apple as a company is just bloodthirsty for sales regardless of the product they release Its mid
Been downgrading cus my phones keep breaking Pixel 2 xlmotherboard fried to Samsung s8pixel defect to iPhone 7water damageand now I have the iPhone 6s so Im going to upgrade the iPhone 15 Pro Max and have been waiting a whileee Im so happy about USBC finally its just going to make sharing bigger videos so much easier
What about battery capacity
There is no way the Iphone changed to USBC Thats actually amazing
They needed to add a sapphire glass not the ceramic bullsht screen
map the action button to open google assistant thats what im going to do with that
isheep technology
Trust you when it comes to detailed explanation
Nothing interesting about this new iphones I feel pity for people buying this iPhones thinking there is any special thing in them No fast charging And only now USB C Smmmmhh
hahaha Just the PRO new featuresjust the PRO
Yall are insane all the iPhones all the way back to the iPhone 11 look exactly the same  How can you point to a redesign when the average user wouldnt be able to distinguish an iPhone 15 over a iPhone 14
Was there anything about Apple adding WiFi 6E to the new iPhone 15s I did find the new silent button on the side to be pretty nifty as it allows users to do much more with it now
"Its amazing how a talented content creator can keep you engaged through the review of yet another boring iPhone 

Satin finish titanium plating usb C Really 

Steve Jobs would be fuming if he were here today 

Zero innovation Incrementally better speed and camera is not innovation Its repurposing the wheel 

I cant think of 1 reason why Id pay for the 15 when Im using a phone that can still match the 15 in pretty much every aspect 

Im genuinely disappointed 

I dont think people realise that Apple are riding on their past laurels and thats gonna end some day 

This is the point that I might consider a Samsung or a 1 or even the Nothing phone just for a refreshing change from the same drab Ive been used to for well over a decade"
No fast charge is a real bummer
i really want apple to release a mini model alongside the plus that would be the only reason to why i would switch back to iphone
As someone who shoots tons of 4K  60 FPS for slow motion I was super intrigued by the prores to an external drive option Thats just nuts Im getting a 15 Pro Max just so I can try that and the new 5x lens
Too little too late I guess Apple is not really going to miss me but after 10 boring years of using iPhones and eventually Apple watches I gave them away and switched back to Android and Garmin GPS watch USBC is nice though
Never have I been less overwhelmed More underwhelmed This is a massive So what
Im def getting new iPhone upgrade from my iPhone 6 Not sure if pro maxultra are worth it Or should I just stay with 15 pro
iphone 15 screen 60 hz for 800 in 2023 come on apple this is ridiculous Was thinking of switching back from android but not anymore the USBC ports almost got me until i figured out the 60hz display
Very glad to see your review in the beginning of the iphone 15 announcement
This just confirms why Ive always had Samsung and never had crapple Yeah we know why they switched to usbc but they definitely could have given it the full capabilities across the line 30 and fast charging etc Ive had 45w charging on my Samsung for a while now Knowing Apple itll be the great new feature on next years phone  I mean they have to save something to get people to buy the next one too
But why do they need to remove the tactile and simple mute toggle to add a customizable button There is plenty of space for both Always a netneutral with this company smh
"Easy
Not worth upgrade"
Im in camp this all shoulda been in the 14
The iPhone 15 pro series looks impressive However I am going to wait for the reviews to see if I will get one If not I will keep what I have until next year
half of the mentioned features arent even really features 
min 052 is that a dark blue iphone 15 its not in the lineup 
That 60Hz just brings around blood in my eyes 
Anker is a nogo for me
stuck with an 11 with battery issues a 15 seems like a wonderful jump lol
wow im upgrading 
Low refresh rate slow charging and what other features
After watching this video I am glad that I moved from iphone13pro to SS S23 Ultra
Dont know why charging is an issue  Literary use wireless all the time and its absolutely perfect  Have not used a cable on my iPhone 14 pro for 8 months 
Im in camp I dont use iPhones but I want the pink one real bad
Why did they branded the Pro chip A17 Pro  because I cannot see it in the iPhone 16 with that name
I checked in to see if I should upgrade from the 11 3yrs old to a 14 pro or the 15 USBC isnt really doesnt matter to me as I dont have other USBC devices I enjoy MKBHD videos as they are unbiased and he tells it like it is Besides MKBHD is the go to for tech knowledge
longbeachgriffy has the best iPhone reviews 
apple announced your name during launch event
The whole move to USBC is not becuase of the kindness of Apples heart  It begins with the European Union pressing all phone manufacturers including Apple to use USBC look for it amongst the news of rulings set out by the EU in the last couple of years  Then benefits brought forward by Apple on USB C are after the fact
This new portrait mode does it also come to older iphones seems like a pure software thing to me
Ish3ep
Ive had every fifth generation number of iPhone 5 and 10X I wanted to get the iPhone 14 but knew the USBC was coming out so Im definitely going to be upgrading from my iPhone X to a 15 Pro Max
"Im in camp going to get one but shall wait a year or two 

I just got the 14 pro max which was a huge upgrade from my first experience with Apple with the iPhone 6 

Im just not in a rush to get it as soon as it comes out"
im on a 3 year phone cycle this is the one that falls on the 3rd year so im in camp im getting this one but only for that reason my old phone replaces my bluetile shop phone that is 6 years old this is my phone buying logic every three years I get a freshie and the shop phone which is starting to suck after 6 years gets a upgrade to my old phone haha
Im def upgrading to 15 Pro Max I have a 14 Pro and I enjoy the larger screens over the smaller screens big hands
No periscope lens that disappointment for me
yeaaa im just the guy who has to have the new pro max every year soo ig 14 pro max 512gb for sale lol
Apple opting not to support USB3 or thundervolt speeds on the nonpro as well as not supporting fast charging over PD is the most Apple thing ever
Curious to know where to get that colorful desert wallpaper you have in the video screen clip  
You know what I was kinda proud of you for the quote apple put out in the event  i was like my man
Love your unbiased review of both apple and droid devices
Pretty dissapointing for me as an iphone 14 pro maxlooks the same
Camp dont care at all hopefully next year they will do a mini
Clearly a powerful chip hampered by being in a phone Get a full desktop in there when connected to a dock So much potential wasted Just a brick like all others Also all of the crazy little annoying differences between the phones such as usb speed Steve Job is turning in his grave right about now
I was excited to switch with the USBC but now with how much Apple is limiting USB2  20W Ill just hold onto my iPhone XR
I have the 14 pro max think Ill just wait until next year to upgrade
"Currently watching this on my Note 20
Ultra as i gave my daughter my old
iPhone XS Max she still wants an
Apple because of her other devices so well upgrade her to the iPhone 15 Plus in Pink"
Cant wait to get the 15 pro max 
Imagine finally being able to sync itunes with usb 3
Will Apple ever recess the cameras in the case like Android phones
Just not enough to justify upgrading Ill skip this one
I always get the pro max
You have to give credit where credit is due Apple 120 knows how to make millions per yearfor only doing cents worth of phone upgrades As a business model that is phenomenal As a consumer that makes 0 sense But people will still drink the KoolAid
HUGE 
New release same crap just usb c Stop the  Apple is poop
Ordered the pro yesterday Cant wait
when i went to their website and saw the comparison between my 13 pro max and 15 pro max they literally changed nothing that is such a scam
Watching on a SE2 Home sick from school
huge flex to just say ill ask when having a question for apple lol
Not to be rude but i dont give an F 
So excited for the 15 Pro Max Ill be upgrading from my 11 Pro Max
I might think of changing my 13 Pro Max with the 15 Pro Max just because the USBC
U could see mkbhd doesnt like iPhones  But he tries his best to not bash it much 
Whats the best choice i phone 15 plus or 14 pro max
Its crazy how they bought the reviewers this year xD
This is cheeks Basic
You guys are paid for positive reviews iPhone has been releasing the same phone since the iPhone 10
"How boring are these Iphones When are they going to eliminate that terrible notch I have the s23 ultra and the difference is huge 

They need to change something as its gettitng boring

This is what I would suggest

 Better screen design with less curves on the edges and small hole for the camera rather than the  notch
 4k panel
 Micro sd card and Headphone socket  this applies to all manufacturers aside from Sony
 Fast charging 65w minimum
 The whole design is getting stale so change it up completely"
I swear its A17 Pro because they are gonna release an Ultra version sometime later The A17 Ultra chip in the IPhone 15 Ultra piss everyone off Or A17 Ultra in the IPhone 16 Ultra
Sooo how does it feel to be quoted as social proof withing the first 3 minutes of the Apple event
wow a shortcut button how innovating lol
People dont realize steel and titanium are pretty on par with each other when it comes to strengthdepending on the alloyyes titanium is made into alloys and rarely used alone of each  Ive been told to think of titanium as essentially the strength of steel with the weight of aluminum
This usb c thing its like apple finally discovered fire meanwhile samsung has been cooking with good stuff
I wouldnt upgrade The previous generation are just fine
Charger not included CNI  They should at least compensate by giving more free Apple iCloud Storage for backup Whats the radiation level for iPhone 15 Only USB3 not USB4  Such a dissapointment
Lol Apple using usb2 the basic version a so lame move from Apple And they usbc on the pro version doesnt implement the thunderbolt version so no usbc docker with screen mouse and keyboard
Who Is Watching This But Dont Have  Enough Money To Buy Any Of These
does the usbc support video output
I have 13 pro  15 pro is good but aint worth the upgrade My battery health is at 86 after 2 years I Will replace battery80 Real upgrade apple can give is some generational tech upgrade to battery situation Just increase it bro Android fan at heart and androids are doing better rn only if they can fix this 3 year software problem Make it 5
This means that Iphone 15 is Iphone 14 and Iphone 14 is iphone 13 What a cheap show by apple Innovate
Where can I get the Dune Wallpaper Which is shown before  clicking on the video 
Do we really need new iphones to be released every year
Apple are so boring lets be honest its the same phone every year Their designers must still be in lockdown with Covid I havent seen anything from them for years
So no not really worth it then
I love all your videos but I cant believe that we are setting here talking about how innovative from Apple is to finally roll out Type C port
"Is the sensor of the main camera in iPhone 15 Pros really larger then the one  in iPhone 14 Pros
Ive been reading that its actually a smaller 115 sensor in 15 Pros "
Apple was nitpicking android features hard for this
"Agreed that no fast charging esp one the Pros is a letdown Although I have to say its not actually great for the battery if your charge current is more than the battery capacity Achieving 50 capacity in 30 minutes means it must already be at that limit

Im leaning to getting it My iPhone X has a green line across the screen And its still Lightning Im thinking of the 15 Pro I dont like carrying a fridge and I do like having 3 lenses Whats still holding me back a little bit is that Ive never bought a new iPhone before Always used And I dont want to get on the bandwagon of getting a new one every year I just had 3 the 4 6S and now the X They all lasted me several years Even the 6S which got submerged in seawater I had it repaired with an aftermarket screen and continued to use it for about 2 more years I think

Its actually a bit silly in that respect Getting so overly excited about a new piece of tech Like that will solve all of your problems "
Hopefully they will adapt USBD a bit faster
For me usb c is a big deal I wont be upgrading anytime soon but Im glad they switched over
iPhone 14s
Im getting one becuase I just broke my 12 max so perfect timing
So its basically just USBC and even that was halfassed
154 Whoever forced them to change to usb c has never tried connecting an elgato using a standard usb cable How many variants of usb cable are there Now we have to put up with that bs USB 20 USB 31 Gen 1 USB 31 Gen 2 and Thunderbolt 4 What a nightmare
2 hours charging is the reason I avoid Pixels and its the norm on iPhones  2018 wants is iPhone back
Everyone that seems to be annoyed by the seemingly small incremental upgrades Im genuinely curious  how much further could they have pushed the 15 I feel like we are plateauing with phones because apple is soon to shift completely over to AR All of their focus and attention will be on vision pro and that new line of products eventually replacing the iPhone completely My guess is that there will never be a truly revolutionary version of the iPhone again
Dont Pixels already have the portrait mode feature where you can change your photo after the fact
iOS is so ugly tho 
Best I phone evvaaa 
So does that mean pro phone charge more than 100 faster than regular
120mm is huge dno why you didnt show it Its crazy for a Phone
While yes titanium is stronger they also reduced the size of the metallic body so I assume the reduced the thickness of the body to match the strength of the old stainless steel body This way they can further tintanium has significantly less density than stainless steel reduce the weight plus make the bezels smaller
Welp I must buy a USB C adapter for Carplay in my Tucson Sucks
I bet if steve still running the apple I dont think he will switch to type c just BC of Europe request 
I just cant wait for Apple Fold
Wow another slab of things that do as all of the other slabs of things and nothing else more Impressive Not
The iphone 15 is like i have shaved my beard No other change iPhone is dying
Remember the day MKBHD bet 10m Apple wouldnt get rid of the mute toggle 
Iphone design  kidney design
USB 20 in 2023 I hate Apple
Apple finally managed to make some products that do not even excite MKBHD
Lil bro needs to separate his video into sections
Wow Is that a Fujifilm GFX100II
Funny how nobody went to Seoul for the Samsung presentation but all went to the USA for the iPhone
If usb c is your biggest feature you have a problem
I want an iPhone so bad 
Same processor in the non pro so its an iPhone 14 actually only the pro is the 15 
Expect USB 3 thats in the iPhone 15 Pro to be in next years iPhone 16 base model Apple seems to have stopped innovating
Very good handson Im looking forward to a lighter phone Cant wait to get my hands on it
I wonder how much Apple paid this guy
What about the video features Record to SSD  and be able to shoot for the vision pro this is great might actually make a really good capture device with multiple focal lengths I think thats pretty big news stoked for the beast mode full spec out 15
Another year of apple midness still got the 13 pro max might be stuck with this for another year or might just get an android
Always find way to cover the shit done by Apple
Got a xs max im considering upgrading to the 15 pro max id love to have a new phone but at the same time the updates arent insanely mindblowing I would want to switch back to Samsung but Im stuck in the apple ecosystem having an apple watch MacBook and an iPhone I always miss how customizable android was and have it set to ur liking I wish iMessage would be available to android but lets be real apple is never gonna do that
BRING BACK THE MINI APPLE Especially now that you finally moved to USBC I wont be upgrading until you do it went from the 14 pro to the 13 mini im tired of these large heavy phones first time not upgrading in IDK how long Ill say it again though i dont think they will do it make a Pro Mini
Well my phone contract is expiring and i cant decide yet if i want to splash the cash on the most expensive contracts right now Or wait a couple of months save a little more money because i need it more than the new phone And when i can afford it buy this 15 pro max
What about display out It would be great to have this option like on ipad
So why exactly is Apple moving it to USBC I have no clue
stoked to finally get usbc on my iphone in 3 years from now when these are cheap on amazon renewed
Honestly ive been an iphone user for quite a long period of time and I can say apple are losing their touch its like they dont have new ideas on how to actually make their phones better i mean this are all changes that they couldve added to the previous iphones
Transfer speeds are a joke on iPhone and now you need the pro just to transfer photos wtf
I am just baffled at how people keep over looking that form the 11pm o max now to the 15 pro max the phones still for the most part looks the exact same I am tired of this old look I dont care how much you up grade a camera
Im not sure on the button I Like just one dedicated switch with visual confirmation that your phone is on silent I expect its a customisable feature that hardly any owners will use but the little red indicator switch will be missed
Ive been an MKBHD subscriber for a long time but this review feels disingenuous Im surprised at how MKBHD has not called out apple for selling a repackaged iPhone 14 pro
nico comentario en espaol 
I wonder how Apple are going to market USB C I can totally see people wondering why their existing cable isnt fitting
 I thought 20watt was already fast charging
Marques you slacking Apple is been forced to switch to USBC by the European Union before 1September 2024 Also replaceable batteries are now mandatory before within year 2027 you mentioned the back glass was easier to replace in iphone 15
Only surprizing thing for stupid iphone fans will be USB type C for 1000plus iphone  old wine in new bottle  No fast charge either 
I started watching lot your videos thanks for your honest opinion Subbed
Waiting for the iPhone 16 mini 
Basically nothing of importance
The disappointment in your voice says it all its 2023 and apple are pushing out incredibly expensive phones with no fast charge what a pile of shit
Too expensive for what we get
As stupid as it sounds I think Im gonna upgrade just for that damn action button So sick of always breaking my thumb nail to switch my 13 pro max from silent to ringer on lol
Im really just trying to hold out until I can buy an iPhone that I dont have to also buy a massive case for I cant imagine why durability isnt a priority
Always love watching your reviews  I change my phone out roughly every 2 to 3 years I am interested to see the advancements from the 12pro max to the 15pro max If it will be worth the jump or if I should wait out one more year Thanks for keeping us informed
Apple fan here but sorry its time to jump on SamsungCant pay for same shit every year
If you use cover on iPhone 14pro nobody notices its 14 pro or 15 pro 
"The fact that they havent improved the fast charging at all is kind of a bummer to me Theres a lot I like about the phone but I have long since moved away from Apple I have kinda wanted to go back to see what they are like and give it a run for a couple years just because they do make a quality product that has very little issues with anything I genuinely believe they make some of the best phones at least but feature wise there are many other companies that have phones that do a couple things better than Apple but not everything 

Me personally fast charging is a BIG deal for me Currently have the Oneplus 10t Say what you want about it it has a great chip has amazing cooling as in it took several minutes of sitting in direct sunlight on a black plastic surface that was searing hot to the touch on a 100 degree day in order for it to complain about heat and then it cooled right down after about a minute or two and resumed normal function On top of that 125watt fast charging 0100 in about 25 minutes roughly and I get about 56 hours of screen on time for my average work day before having to charge it that includes frequent Youtube music and constant bluetooth usage at 90 screen brightness and 120hz refresh rate Is it as efficient as an iPhone Absolutely not not even close The battery is twice as large and like I said it takes 25 minutes at 125 watts Total power consumption of my phone is a bit higher than the iPhone while being slower and the camera isnt as good stability isnt as good as it has weird bugs from time to time Inscreen fingerprint sensor is occasionally spotty works most of the time but randomly decides not to same with facial recognition And then theres the build quality The Oneplus is very good but the iPhone is better overall which is something that Apple has always had I feel 

The quoted freedom of customization on Android is a bit overrated at least for someone who doesnt do all that much with their phone Im much more interested in computers than phones I do like having a nice phone but thats about it I have come to realize I dont really care who it is from as long as it feels nice to use on the day to day but that lack of proper fast charging is a killer for me Maybe if the iPhone 16 gets much faster charging then I will switch but being able to wake up a little late on a work day having forgotten to charge my phone and throwing it on the charger while I get ready and 10 minutes later it has gone from 30 to 80 or if I want to go out for some hours and doing the same thing is a huge difference to me I dont have to sit and wait forever Its plug it in wait 10 minutes and now I have enough to get me through most of the day I just wish Apple wasnt so slow to do things that the rest of the industry has started doing It just feels like their head is too far up their own behind sometimes and it is infuriating because they could very easily have the best phone with every feature that everything else has all in one and do it better than everyone but they dont because they know they are already winning and people will buy the phones anyway Its kind of sad really"
Forgot to talk about the ability to take 3D photos on iPhone pro and pro max in landscape
Meh what a joke
Titanium you say Cant wait to see Zacks review
"Ive been in Android World since Cupcake and I think Im finally going to try out the iPhone this year  Strictly because everyone in my family is using the iPhone and being able to use FaceTime will be nice  Literally FaceTime is the only reason Im switching  Still not excited about how tightly Apple controls the interface but Im sure Ill get used to it

Question  Ive been using the OnePlus 9 for the past two years now  The charging brick is USBC and is SUPER fast when plugged into my current phone  I know that it will not translate to charging speeds with the new iPhone but is there any danger in using that brick with an iPhone"
We should be praising The EU for forcing American tech to do the right thing
If you have a 14 you aint missing anything man This is an upgrade for someone with a much older phone
Definitely a 14s
so same shit   aight cool
So the new iphone basically copied the Bixby button on a Samsung phone and added USBC port
This is magik and revolutionary to have USBC port Apple invented it And people fall for it
"When the iphone 14 was released i said to myself okay apple maybe in 10 years time will be worth to buy just based on how bad the product is compared to the competitors in their price range and even under their price range by atleast 50 After this event i would say 20 years before it would be a worthwhile consideration to mention an iphone before a phone upgrade None of the features do anything or if they would apple would only give them in the pro max which is so overpriced that in that league theres no point to buy it

The base model should be the pro max for the price of the base model 25 atleast and scale from there or make atleast halfway decent stuff"
Does Dynamic Iceland with 60hz look good enough
The USB C change only made it a big deal because of the EU legislation If not for that Apple will still be using lightning Same with 815 more replaceable design This is geared towards the new EU law that requires all mobile phones handheld consoles and similar devices to have user replaceable batteries by 2027
"I guess apple is having a new charger outta the box this time 

No as long as isheeps dont complain theyll keep removing their stuff"
Im on 12 pro i was really excited for this event but it was very underwhelming idk I was hyped when I saw they quoted you congrats Also should I make a switch from 12 pro or should I wait another year this one was meh for some reason Most of everything I liked the colors
The main reason I wont switch to IPhone is that the phone still feels like the companies phone whereas android makes it feel like its your phone not too restrictive
"I was planning on upgrading this year from my 6 year old S9 After this release I may just wait another year or get an S23 Ultra 

The colors the curved edges and brushed titanium are pretty irrelevant Most people use cases anyways The 15 upgrades were minimal"
Great review  was waiting for your take Was at a VisionPro developer meetup last night The big news for a few of us is that the  iPhone 15 Pro will capture shoot stereoscopic video Wasnt sure if Id replace the 12 Pro Max But now Its a must have
"Super keen Were pretty much a USBC only household now Wife has been holding out on an older iPhone for years now hoping wed get USBC but wed given up So this is great news for her

Travel will be so much better"
They could have given 90Hz Display on iPhone 15
Jesus Christ loves you
Dude i quit this brand years ago in simple word is scam if Samsung do it to is scam buying phones that barely change every year why
Camp Dont care at all
Finally USBC but rather unsurprising Id love to have a folding 5x telephoto camera but I dont want the giant phone for it Looks like I might wait another year before upgrading to see if theyll bring it to next years smaller phone
Quick questiondid the new update to the airpod pro gen 2 make them louder
As an wvfrm enjoyer iPhone everythingasexpected
Watching this on Ip 6s 16gb  wish will get this ip15 as an upgrade 34yrs from now 
I wish the watches looked like the phones
I love that they qouted you on the 15 Macbook Air
Zero need to upgrade from previous version of iPhone IMHO
im so happy i bought a iphone 13 you can just use magnet charging cables for all your charging devises
iPhone 15 doesnt have same screen Like 14 pro its only 60Hz you forget to mention this
I wish Apple Google and Microsoft would just die
Still rocking my iPhone 12 I got around release so its been almost 2 years Really I feel 0 excitement towards the new stuff Apple is releasing Ill probably wait another 2 years or so before I upgrade I have a wireless charger in my car my battery lasts me all day I generally dont care
Guys help me    Should i buy iphone 14 pro max at 8 discount because iphone 15 pro max is more expensive and i want BIGGER display or should i buy 15 plus with no 120 hz which will lack in gaming experiencenot minding camera here
I really really hope that they will sell lightning cables for at least 5 more years or longer I want to use my iPhone 14 Pro for a long time BRING BACK THE SWITCH THOUGH
Hey why are you flying Polaris class To elite to mingle with us slugs
So will any youtuber be honest and just say thats its literally the same phone with just the type c port Apple is becoming so stale its absurd Are there no creative people left at Apple come on
i am comparing the camera sensor size the size of the sensor of iphone 14 pro max and iphone 15 pro max are they the same size
How many average iPhone users will care about focal length for the camera Most of us use it for pointandshoot But I expect influencers to tout these as the best iPhones ever overhype them and give them the best reviews ever to keep their Apple event access
Theyre going to save fast charging for the iPhone 17 Pro that way theyll scale improvements gradually to milk consumers with NEW value added propositions as they have to continue to drop a new version annually
There truly is no new innovation associated with the Apple logo anymore Its sad to see it stagnant for this long Now they are playing catch up to all others with the introduction of USB C
Im impressed with the gaming hardware for the pro models definitely trading in my 13 pro max for the 15 version
Always laughing when iPhones finally get what Android has had for YEARS They are always behind the times They have fast chips take nice videos and good battery life but thats about it Glad to hear about USBC finally
Soooo almost no reason to upgrade from the 13 Pro Max to the 15
"Iphones are without a doubt the best smartphones but for me personally its not worth it I am happy with my midrange phones with 400500 price which usually last 35 years without problems aswell 
Iphone fanboys would surely tell me that androids are lagging and useless after 2 years which is indeed true if you are considering some cheap 200 trash smartphones A decent midrange android smoothly serves for several years"
I heard action button and coming from iphone 11 So it was time for me
Technically titanium is NOT stronger than steel at least unless you specify both alloys you are talking about 
I think iphone 15 for most users would be better than iphone 15 pro because new features on iphone 15 pro are for specific situations which ordinary user would not use
So its just USBC
Any new iphone pros that comes out now since the iphone 11 pro you put a phone case they allllll look the same until u actually hold it or ask the person what iphone is it Change the design pls 
Apple is just boring
Apple should make the iPhone be able to give over power via induction so the Apple Watch and Airpods can accept charge magnetically
Should I upgrade form 12
Lol I thought it was hilarious how they kept calling it the most pro
Hes deffo seein tha lad off the show  They a couple 
Would love to see compare contrast between 14 Pro and regular 15
Apple is carbon neutral company They need to make phone not just more repairable They need to make REPAIRABLE phone
My first thought was the faster speeds but of course it is a upgraded feature  And the lack of fast charge 
What about the gaming stuff
Im only looking at the new iPhone because Im currently watching this video on an iPhone 8 But Im still thinking about only upgrading to the 13 or maybe even the 12 strictly because of the battery life Also typing this comment also sounds like the most average Apple comment ever
I am very sure that apple will remove the charging cable from the box
So its kind if a downgrade 
"I wish people would replace their old phones with new ones every 5 or 6 years Technology seems to progress in small increments each year so its not really worthwhile to upgrade annually unless youre a journalist or a photographer For everyday use it makes sense to hold onto our older phones iPhones are so reliable that we should keep them for an extended period not only for environmental reasons but also to save some money which is especially valuable in todays world We all appreciate Marquess work because he succinctly summarizes the advantages and disadvantages

Nevertheless if I had the financial means and there were no environmental concerns I would opt for an iPhone 15 Pro Max Currently I have a basic iPhone 12 although Ive never owned a Pro version Dreaming doesnt cost anything But once again its a good idea to keep your mobile device for as long as possible Great job as always Marques"
It annoys me that a lot of the new camera features could probably be supported on slightly older phones since the sensors arent that different It looked like they specifically called out new dedicated parts of the chip that are used for that image processing so maybe it would be difficult to add that backwards compatibility Or more likely just not worth their while since its one of the few product differentiators
"I did notice the price of the Pro Max especially because I was really hoping their base storage would improve but it really didnt they just got rid of one tier 
Either way  if you decide that you want console level games on your phone 128GB is not going to cut it Call of duty mobile alone is 20GB and most console games nowadays are 50GB Even if your purpose wasnt to game on your phone and you just record videos thats still a ton of space that its gonna take up and 128GB is not gonna cut it in the long run"
Cool but i gave up on Apple after the 5 i just refused to buy a phone from such a scammer 
Waiting Iphone 16 pro Max Ultra Titanium Armageddon Edition in Red like Hell
Samsung galaxy S2O is still better
The One Piece is real 
After seeing the pricing my iPhone XR has stopped lagging
Not a big upgrade Action button kinda gimmick only haha overall not fully satisfied with iphone 15pro max Not worth it to upgrade my 14promax
"Its crazy theres still no finger print reader on the iPhone WTF
Thats not pro thats basic"
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent so if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised 104
"iPhone 1515 Pro Impressions Not Just USBC

 keep talking just about it  

amazing job wow"
Ive held out long enough Im getting the 15pro max bye bye 11pro max youve done a good job carrying me this far time to part ways
Im in camp I am an android user and will always be and my wife is an iPhone user and will always be and while her phone is only 1 year old and its not time to upgrade i want us to share the same charger so Im buying her the new phone
Those Anchor accessories looks more interesting than this IPhone series 
Iphone 15 plus USB 20  23 years old WTF Apple
We need that Fairphone 5 review brother
Is the action button haptic or a real button
mkbhd for real farming views out here
Im in the camp of my iPhone 11 Pro screen cracked a month ago and because the new release was coming out I decided to wait and Ill be getting the iPhone 15 pro Why not 
I get the impression apple is stomping its feet and pouting because they have to follow rules
The only impression video Ive been waiting for
"i would definitely get one cuz im a tech geek but im 13years old 
and im still impressed with my 12 mini"
iPad 10th gen got usbc earlier this year  iPhone SE2 looks to be the last apple product with a Lightning port  Really think Samsung Apple and Google should wait 2 or maybe even three years before releasing any type of new phone
WaOoOo apple sucks 
I have to wonder what was the point Except the usb c wow you caught up with the rest of the world most of these changes couldve been software updates Joe Public isnt really going to notice the rest of the changes People will buy it though 
Marques bro  15 Pro also has NavIC GPS India indigenous GPS and also Thread Networking Technology which is not publicized well These features are not available in 15 or plus
But when the girl presenting ip15 and max said All new design was hilarious I see they are already selling C to Lightning adapter for 30 Only Apple 
"Looks like the C connector hole will be hard to clean


Edit Not only does the center post allow for debris and rocks to get wedged in an unable to be removed with extremely thin cleaning tools a cotton swab can not fit inside to clean the connectors the cable it self is more prone to issues because of the shape and massive hole in the center Plus the USB comes with no advantage unless you buy the model with the USB controller"
GETTING IT 
15 pro colors are so disappointing
bro be honest this is the same iphone 12 years later costing the triple of the price
Its like watching a samsung galaxy release a couple years ago   Im having to get this iPhone regardless due to work bit seriously apple or drip feeding you features that samsung got years ago 
Shoutout to Europe for forcing Apple to switch to USBC
What i dont understand is why theyre still dragging their feet kicking and screaming with this whole USB C iphone biz Just fucking switch it over to the industry standard were fed up with this shit
No pro RAW from the 15
I guess the bright side of apple innovations year to year are that there arent any So its also never a bad time to upgrade if youve been holding on to your phone for more than a few generations You probably wont be missing out if you get the 15 this year and didnt wait 1 more year for the 16 
Great phones that can offer a great experience that surely will soon be ruined by iOS 17 Its always the bugs Hopefully the battery is better
The switch for titanium might be explain by lower density making it slightly lighter maybe
C charge no fast charging titanium still can brake your Screen SO PRETTY MUCH THE SAME CRAP
The 60fps ProRes is the best part that can be transferred during recording to external ssd
Quality toggle is unavailable Does trending lower the bit rate
USBC eco win
Ill wait till the throw in the 48 mp sensor in the 5x camera
Bro seriously I used I phone from 2007 to 2013 after that until now only several Androids including Asus ROG Phone 3 right now using Nothing Phone 2 I do wanted to go back to iPhone really and I always look what you have to say on this now I am thinking it took the European Union to make Apple move to USB C but with no fast charging now if I go for 15 and then cant imagine how I feel if they introduce fast charging in iPhone 16 you feel me
Its the same thing its the same thing 
It is a common misconception that titanium is stronger than steel It is certainly lighter and more heat resistant but the strength is Not that obvious 
Another interesting miss but with big potential what if the USBC could connect to an external monitor for gaming and video perhaps to a TV Game console in your pocket
Bade kalu bhai hindi mein bhi banou sheik video
The price is  and will always be terrible Shouldnt be 799 or 899 Thats almost 2 or 3 car notes  or half onna months rent Got everybody goin broke Everythings streaming services iPhone cant download stuff like androids can
The 13 pro max I got takes the best photos Ive ever seen a phone take I cant wait to get my hands on the 15 pro max and see what it can do Im excited that usb c is finally here
Honestly the usbc is making me finally get an iPhone Never had one
i was really looking forward to fast charging with the usbc port but guess not
"Oh I love Anker I only get my accessories and cables from them 
Also will be upgrading to iPhone 15 pro max"
Apple doesnt care about consumers anymore at this point theyre just lining the pockets of shareholders its sad they do a talk show every year to introduce features no one uses leaving important features they should be adding its irritating at this point
The only reason Apple is now using USBC is because there is a new EU requirement that all devices sold within the EU must have USBC
60hz is ridiculous
Im still using the Xs Max so Ill be spending 89 on a new battery  I wasnt blown away by much this year  I thought the 3nm chip would have a much more impressive effect on performance  The action button doesnt excite me  iPhone 16 looks to be my target upgrade at the moment  Just my opinion
iPhone charging speed is a complete and inexcusable disaster OnePlus chargers in a small faction of the time with longer battery life How do you iPhone users live with this
I will most likely buy the new 15 Pro Max only because the battery performance in my 12 Pro Max has severely declined
Cool phone but I will stick with my Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra kick ass phone 
Im gonna have to get a USBC to 35mm adapter for my earbuds 
usb2 on the cheap model man this is one petty company if Ive ever seen one
Do we think its USB 30 or 31 or 32 Edit the website says USB3 speeds are 10gb so that means 31
No mention of 3D movie recording I thought that was the biggest news
I feel like I saw the finger print recognition unit on the side when they show it in the apple event am I tripping
It seems almost everyone was waiting for a review from Marques He is really good at what he does
Actionbuton to Siri shortcut unlock chargeport on my Tesla Nice
Imagine buying a BRAND NEW iPhone and it uses USBC 20 I honestly feel sorry for Apple users at this point You finally get USBC after it being around forever and its a version of USB thats been obsolete for over 20 years Good job Apple
"The miniscule bump from 3x to 5x zoom isnt even worth mentioning 10x or gtfo

Im ditching my s23u and while Ive always had pro maxs in the past Im getting a regular 15 plus"
Im pretty much only interested in the 15 as a photographer due to the new focal length options  Ive always wanted them to give us the option of 35mm  50mm  I also only upgrade every 23 years so Im due for it Everything else they mentioned is meh
617 no what fast charging is a standard feature on mostly every phone now
Im pretty sure that Apple only changed the port because if they didnt they would not be able to sell their phones in the EU 
Not just USBC but the biggest update is the USBC Pathetic that these days major iPhone updates are features that others have been using for years
Lol 
My favourite Youtuber period
Its not ok for 1000 bucks to get 60 hz screen and usb 20  The apple i think  in ther cheapest and profit way they do that sAMSUNG Huawei  xiaomi phones at 300   maybe less they have 120 HZ SCREEN USB 30 WHAT IN 2023 IS A MUST TO HAVE ON ANY PHONE And a fast charge at least 60 ampers and good coality cable in the box Apple u want profit  u should offer more than that u offer now or we say pas and get other phones
This is what I want to know and Marquez this would be a great video Why hasnt Apple or the other OEMs went with a indestructible plastic or carbon type glass that cannot be broken the technology exists but for some reason we still have to deal with broken glass
Im unconvinced that action button isnt going to be inadvertently pressed while in my pocket Im already set to order my iPhone 15 pro and already received my Spigen case If even one time the action button gets pressed accidentally Ill cut the button out of the case so it makes it harder to press that button
Ill keep rocking my iPhone 12max pro
The portrait thing should be a software update for everybody  
its funny how pointless this new iphone is aside from losing market share overseas
iShit 15
My Galaxy A54 still better in features than a brand new Iphone Apple slackin and scammin
Im currently using the iphone 13 pro max definitely looking at the reviews to see if if the 15 pro max is worth the upgrade
Apple changes Iphone ligthing to usb c is a great change but if apple is adding a check that only apple branded or approve usb c will work perfecting and for any other normal usb c it will throw a popup then I guess there is no point on to switch to usb c then there is no point from save the environment perspective  As Arun from Mrwhosetheboss once said Apple or any other companies are becoming Carbon netural but only from there own stand point and not from the knock off effects which they are creating
Their youtube video is like a scientology ad
"Thank you for the great review Still not interested in such an expensivepretentious phone 
Mid range android offer is broad and affordable "
"I was excited but let down I expected  a bit more Will probably wait u til the 16 releases 

Im still rocking the 12 pro"
Im the only guy who doesnt like the dynamic island 
0738 Glass is glass and glass breaks
even my galaxy note8 from 2017 has that memory stuff on the pictures
I always wait a couple of years before upgrading again I currently have the iPhone 11 Pro and I will be upgrading this year it seems worth it with the dynamic island and usb c
Apple knows how to woo their loyal customers with features that already exist on other phones lol 90 of these new features already exist on Samsung devices  Welcome to Samsung Apple users And yes Yall can burrow our chargers and USBC cords
Ill be honest I am only excited for the hardware raytracing
So basically the same piece of cp ot has been since forever Its just insane how useless iphones are I cant stand mine and have been regretting ever since I got it 2 years ago In the meantime I have been using my 5 years old samsung galaxy s9 plus which is actually faster than a 2yearold iPhone
looks cool overall not buying it but i find it funny how they put so much effort into the shell that everyone is just going to through into a case so the back glass doesnt shatter on drops
This will probably be my final upgrade for a while just simply due to the usb c port
nothing changed always the same design  no exciting
"Bro looked left way to muchlol
Should memorize better"
elfbar and all the other vape brands beat apple to usbc years ago lol
Wow It looks exactly like any other Iphone in the past 10 years And they have a USBC New technology 
5mil 12 hrs
Marques lowkey shade on the iPhone features Ouch 
two Id cards from the event on pillows is nice touch 
030 made me laugh way harder than it shouldve
Waiting for real reviews and verdicts that arent unbiased
gotta love the casual ill just go ask Apple a question
Did he say an hour and a half charging
Did you say iphone 15 and iphone 15 plus
Goes to show that tech YouTubers opinions are effecting the future of Apples products Congrats on the shoutout and thank you for the honest look into the new phones Marques
"I just cant get this around my head apple again announced new feature button which you can set to do something samsung has it for years 
USB C same thing portrait mode on each foto we got that with update I dont know how long ago bear in mind talking about S20 3 gen back old phone"
"I really dont like the look of the mute switch tbh and find the previous switch more useful  when you flick the switch on the older models you see a little red strip which shows you its on silent mode  where is the indication off screen to tell you if your phone is silent with the new button 
It comes in handy if youre in a meeting etc and you just pull the phone out to double check its silent and all you need to see is that red strip "
Seems like a lot of people are sleeping on the spatial video although I guess that was not available for handson yet
Please can you talk in a video about airplane mode and turning it off without the unlock code when they deactivate it you cant find it anymore please please please they should give us our money back because I have complained to support for a long time and they dont give a solution to the error security and the good thing is that they block the chat and comments on their YouTube can someone test if it happens in the 14 although I doubt it that they have rectified why a worker does not think the security error is important it is a shame because in the 30 euro cell phones Android asks you for the unlock code before being able to deactivate or turn it off 
"Marques I am surprised that you didnt touch on the fact that Apple decided not to fully extend the benefits of the 3nM chip set for gaming We will have a console like gaming chip on the new iPhone but no way of docking it to play on a larger screen That just seems like such a massive missed opportunity interested in your thoughts on this and something to possibly touch on in the full review 

Love your videos as always the GOAT"
Hi Guys I was always  android guy but I want to ask what is the best starting Iphone right now 
Great coverage brother  I love the USB 3 Controller added to pro models for fast transfer and also you can unload images and add external hard drive usb c if youre a youtuber or photographer or video dude  Thanks for covering the key that they didnt that it doesnt have fast charge with usb c so WE will still be using 20 watt which I already use  I am 13 Pro 1TB and im gonna stick to it until iPhone 16 or 17 until it really feels a huge upgrade  I do videos but I have cameras for that  Always best insight  much love for you  Starlight all seamless flush color to Titanium does look Cleanagreed
Its a cellphone  I am content not feeling obligated to change the hardware frequently due to either necessity or FOMO
Like you pointed out the iPhone 16 with inherent that A17 pro chip and with it the higher data speeds
i always get the pro maxs
At the end of the day it will still take you some time to unlock it Face recognition is in he past
No Its definitely just USBC   They paid you for the promo
I literally do not remember the last time I saw a video on a new Apple iPhone and was actually impressed
What new design 
Apples pink phone go Barbie go Barbie go
the 12x is for people who want to have 35mm focal length which is a pretty good feature for photographers but yeah USB C is kind of the big thing
Finally usb c but without fast charging speed why
But its the SAME 60Hz like forever u get now with xiaomi 200 phones the 120hz display The Pro models are personaly the only good option 
I love your yellow eyeshadow Slayed
Apples embargo must be to release review around the launch of pixel line up so it will drown in it 
Same same same same same pro same same same same
Is Apple gradually Shrinking the dynamic island and moving towards fullscreen without it Hmm think soo Waiting until next year to buy new one
cant wait till 2027 when apple announce a removable battery
"Im currently on an 11 which has been a great phone and still is replaced battery once Would like 5G  Dynamic Island so was weighing up a 15 but was a bit bummed about 60Hz although not the end of the world as Im used to it USBC transfer times not an issue for me but like the thought of the action button so may have to go pro but Id want 256 storage and at 1100 in UK I dont think Im that enamoured by it

Will wait for some hands on reviews before taking the plunge

Overall a little underwhelming"
I think Ill stick with my iPhone 13Pro Max 
I really appreciate your work mkbhd But I really expected more from apple this year Even folding phones but what a bummer This year target audience is something different
its not like they came with the idea of switching to usbc they were forced to because otherwise they couldnt sell in europe
Theres a reason why he is the best techtuber onthe planet 
Whats about the cars
Isnt the fast charging accualy bad for the phone 
I thought the volume buttons were gonna be haptic kinda like the home button was back in the day
M the boss still using 8 plus m not going to join this herd like sheep by wasting our hard earn money for this scam of the century iPhone
Nope Still got the pill
I was hoping to be more impressed w the new features I was hoping there would be 10x optical zoom All the other chip or speed functions are things the average consumer will not notice Im thinking Ill stick w my iPhone 13 pro max and wait to see what they come up w next year All that marketing jibberish failed to impress
How was your flight in the first class
OOOOooo a new overpriced tracking device so when will you want to be part of the Freedom suppressing Chinese Social Credit System Opps sorry Kid didnt know youre sponsored by Anker meaning youre already part of it
Want faster transfer rate  Save all photos or videos to external Thunderbolt 4USB4 SSD storage
I am Still rocking my iphone xr find it hard to part with itbut after ios 17 I dont think I will get any more updates so roll on iphone 16 pro for me
Waste of time same crap from Apple like always
I wonder why they didnt talk about the battery surely its miles better with the 3nm processor
The only exciting thing thats coming is the new iOS Not worth upgrading my 13 Pro
its a shame the cool new things are only for the pro max version the others just feel the same
Its just the 14 If you a 12 or newer just keep it
Nextgeneration portraits as always Samsung already had that 
"Imagine not having usb 3 speeds on your phone by default since usb c came with said phone

That will probably become standard with the iphone 30"
let me know when IPhones either have removable batteries ANDor are repairable and Ill give them a consideration
Just came here to listen that hes been using the 15 series since a week
My S9 plus has a bixbyaction button
Iphone 15 has usb 2 speeds while only the pro has usb 3 speeds Soo scummy from apple
Good to know there isnt anything special about this new iPhone so I feel comfortable now to upgrade to flip 5 from iPhone 7
Nice subtle updates but Ill stick my android and look forward to see what Samsung does on their next release
You know Phone is for the girls men have androids
I phone adopts new port and runs it at 10year old speed Nice
No mention of Wifi6e I feel this is a big improvement for those in countries where supported  and if you have router that supports it
Wow usb C And its 60Hz display Apple are so smart or people are just stupid I think its bought
Im still using the iPhone 13 Pro and it still works great after watching this review Im wondering if its worth the leap or just keep waiting until the time is right to get it
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT WHAT 92 OF WHAT MARK SAID ABOUT THE NEW IPHONE REMIND ME OF A SOUTHPARK EPISODE SIMPSON DID IT YEAH ANDROID DID IT ANDROID DID IT
Lol every iPhone user is now talking nicely to their Android friends so that they can use their USB charger as well
Cant wait for waveform this week
"Apple in 2023 revolutionary new USBC 
Samsung in 2016 Ok 
"
Ive never used an iPhone and Im 31 Now Im looking into trying out iPhone 15 pro or if I should upgrade from the S22Ultra to the S23 Ultra Im literally caught in the middle as Ive been told theres nothing really to the iPhone m likewise Ive been told that iPhones are the better ones
Im coming from an iphone 8 so it should be good once I get the 15 pro max
All I gather from this review is that my 12 Pro Max 256GB that Ive never even gotten close to 50GB of used storage is still relevant 
Iphones are getting real feminine
Ofc they wont give u fast charge they LL give after 12 years like new cool stuf charge like others lol
"Innovation seems to be dead in Apple factory Apple is playing with same design of phones add some features most of it are already in Android from past few years

Apple is focusing only on Hardware whereas the market is and will be of Softwares going forward And Android has a great advantage here

I wont be surprised if Apple goes Blackberry way and discontinues selling iPhones

We soarly miss Steve Jobs kind of innovation in iPhones"
Android kids crying in the comments as if their S23s Folds and Flips get life changing upgrades every year 
Same boring colors
Lol this the same phone for the last 3 years
Just off what they told us and what we know do you think its worth upgrading I have a 14 pro and my sister a 13 pro
Mistake to lose the mute switch Imo
Amazing woohoo  cute iPhone 15 3 
I love the mute switch  best fidget I ever had
they changed to usbc because eu forced them to if they didnt change they wouldnt be allowed to sell the phone en eu
"Camera of iPhone 15 48MP and 2m combined seems different and slightly smaller than the one of iPhone 14 Pro same 48MP but 244m combined

The 48MP sensor of iPhone 15 seems to have a similar size around 117 of the previous iPhone 14 or iPhone 13 Pro For reference the sensor in iPhone 14 Pro and 15 Pro is 1128 much larger

Reference Apple Spec GSM arena"
Didnt mention the fact that Apple mention you during the presentation yesterday Very humble
Will they still sell the lightning
iPhone is like the Lada Niva of phones Same design always
what about planned obsolescence
Anothe captalized trap for people
Honestly iPhone drops are just more and more disappointing every year If the UI wasnt so nice I wouldve gone over to android They actually do this thing called releasing new features and actually improving current features and tech
Im camp dont care at all But enjoy your take on it all
Well actually Marcus USBC data transfer speeds of 10Gbps are  a revolution level upgrade its why Im livid at the rumors they wont fully upgrade to usb 30 speeds unless you go pro I understand thats not a huge deal for EVERYONE but it is for me
Underwhelming would be the key word here Remember when iPhone launches used to be game changing Now we just get usbc and a slightly clever telephoto lens on the pro Definitely wont be upgrading yet
I have a 14 Pro and if that new 5x lens was coming to the 15 Pro I would upgrade The Pro Max is just too big for me
in other words NOTHING new
They dont add the USB 3 standard and fast charging to the basic iPhone models because of spite as they were forced to use the USBC connector Its also a way to sell more Pro models because lots of people want better specs than the basic model can offer
This the same fkn phone PASS
I dont care at all Not until Apple unveils their folding phone Im enjoying the Z Fold 5 way too much right now
I am seriously thinking if it is finally time to switch to Android Phone 
Fun fact Apple was forced to use USB by the European Union
I look at this iPhone and feel nothing Just another phone with the same features that not going to improve my life at all Save your money for travel
Its ridiculous how Apple rations out features and technology that have been out for years and still charge 1k for basically the same phone they previously released
fast charging will be iphone 16 thunderbolt fast file transfersing iphone 17 etc
Samsung chargers I phone chargers same WhatsApp group 
As a new creator without a professional camera I love all the features the 15 pro max has to offer
I love the unbiased approach you take to all this stuff while still being enthusiastic Thanks for the review
eh not impressed
I could bet Apple called a17 Pro cause next year instead of making the Iphone 16  16 Plus with a 1yearold chip they will announce them with the chip being called a18 and the Pros with a18 Pro chip in line with the mline chips names This way people will no longer criticize them for using an old chip in the regular models and instead Apple will say Heyeverybody gets a new chip but the Pro lineup is even better with a new Pro chipset
Thank you Without that red arrow i would have not known what a phone looks like s
New bottom and USB C o wow
"As a connection design lightning was always a better connector It was more simple more reliable and durable Its just facts Ive had many high end usbc from samsung anker stop working after a few years But i still use my iphone 6 cable 
So in that regard ill miss it But the speed and compatibility of usbc make me so happy at the same time"
They have switched to USBC to minimise ewaste
Can we expect under the display camera on next year iphone
What a farce
Crap far behind chinese n Korean phones
I want the pink in pro max
So nothing With type C Got it Ill stick with my 11
Remember when he rated the apple better than android
the rest of the Apple product lineup will have to have USBC ports by 2026 thank you EU very based
Bottom line is this seems like its a push to ONLY get you to buy the pro max version asits the only one with the better camera which is what makes the Iphone better these days other than that id skip this version
The ship has sailed in
Just bought the 14 last year god this pissed me off lmao
have fun waiting 2 hours for your 1000 phone to charge while my 150 phone charges in 20 minutes
"Slam alikum
Hi Marcus I need a favor from you Help me get into America Thank you"
still rocking the iPhone 11
Its all boring and useless
Im in camp Cantt Afford Anything Right Now
Love apple but nothing here to get excited about
"Ive been on Android since 2011 but Im switching back to iPhone 15 plus this year 
The main reason is my son is in high school and wife is a teacher And then I have a daughter in Jr high 

My wife tells me that almost every kid at her high school is on iPhone so our kids are missing out if they arent on iPhone Ive already switch my wife and daughter over and will switch my son during the holidays
Im not waiting Im preordering on Friday"
Could you please stop saying PRO hehehehe
noticeably lighter in the hand My guy its one gram
lets dich iphone 15  series  apple fooling the people with same shit
"Everyone is talking about getting a new port but nobody is talking about the action button

This is pretty revolutionary and nobody talked about it on the Apple Watch ultra too a physical button that you can do anything with is insane and revolutionary imo No other phone has something like this that I know of and for some reason nobody cares"
"Slam alikum
Hi"
im interested tati
When Marques one of the most respectful tech creator someone that always give the benefit of the doubt one thats always careful in phrasing his words to deliver truthful statements while also protecting the companies interest intact when he has almost nothing to say you know that theres really nothing in here
Cringe company
Would the natural titanium change to the rainbow colors after being heated up like an exhaust
Youll never know why this comment has so many likes 
Fast charging kills your battery so quickly Same for the EV batteries
No fast charging was a big miss for me 
You sound SAD
I see you like to fly United Polaris business class to the Apple event Nice
Her King
natural pro max is a go
Big fail not to have 20 Gbps transfer speeds Would be amazing for transferring movies and photos But still the 10Gbps is solid
I want the pro but damn I wish they had the same colors the Pros are too muted for colors tbh like at least give us the product red option
Its over when all we have is a different shade of excellence
The iPhone is a complete joke  Samsung has all these features years ago
Where has that think different thing gone 
What a disappointing release Good video tho
Can we please start giving credit to people with disabilities That side button is a direct pull from accessibility shortcut that used to be used with the sleep wake button
capitalism breeds innovation 
I was not really much interested in the new iPhone but the videography and the aspect ratio kept me hooked till the end
Me watching in 8k
I cant understand why Apple doesnt have a special room for special guests like MKBHD where you can review the phone alone with your camera guy instead they have you there in a crowded room with some random guys nobody knows and an apple guy in front of you looking like if you were going to steal  a damn phone which probably theyll send you in a couple of weeks sorry I think you deserve better
Not me having to buy that magnetic lightning cable for my AirPods max
the craziest new feature is that the iphone 15 pro starts at 1199 instead of the 1299 for the iphone 14 pro i was actually expecting a price increase after i heard of the titanium and i was sure apple would make us pay for usbc but i guess i was wrong
"Type C made sense from way back but Apple didnt wanna see sense
Welcome to future iPhone users"
So glad apple was forced to get rid of their charging tyranny BS
its a major crime how this company keeps making the same old phones with  TWEAK and call it a new Iphone and people actually buy them with double the price of the older one
got an iPhone 13 pro which is still amazing except the battery life is getting worse as always Im planning to get the new iPhone next year
47 million views in 12 hours Apple products really do attract massive attention
"this is the most interesting iPhone ever
USBC right to repair apple silicon UWBU1 open third party store in EU good specs camera MP display Hz
Lets see if the Pixel has UWB which it will not have due to FCC filing and then probably switch to Apple I hope they change their Apple Store tax to be more developercostumer friendly as well like Epic did with Unity"
I really like the new iphone
wow still looks the same
Theyll use fast charging as a new feature next year
I am very happy about the switch to USBC but my iPhone 13 is going on two years and running strong This will be the first time in a while that I continue using a phone outside of the installment plan period previous Android user and so Im pretty satisfied with that Ive already got the Lightning cables at home so might as well keep using them to get more value out of the phone
Im still making monthly payments on my iPhone 12 Pro Max 
Will the 14 pro case fit on the new 15 pro 
iPhone is a new Nokia
I still cant tell if this phone is worth upgrading from my 11 Pro Max despite the generational gap the phone has held up pretty well
"Z fold they settled 
iPhone 15 not just usb c I promise I promise 
The bias is ridiculous"
Why go all out on sheep Living in 2015 with a quality back and sides 
Why in the ever living heck would they NOT put a 30 port on both models Oh wait its Apple Using an ANKR charging brick usually helps increase charging speeds anyway just weird
"Noticeably lighter in the hand
Yeah by 1 gram  "
Still on iPhone 12 Pro Max blink and theres a new one
You all are geeks in these comments and ride Apple lmao
IDGAF about the back and rails of an iPhone The only time Ive ever physically touched these parts of an iPhone is when I am removing it from the box it came in inserting the phone into a case
"Apple have only really changed over to USBC due to the EU rulling
thats the real reason"
As a person who has lived in the socialist EU knows Apple went kicking and screaming to the USB C port which is a good thing when you travel to the EU
"Mkbhd lets talk about iphone
Youtube  lemme show how good Samsung new fold adds"
So stoked iPhone 15 pro is going to be a game changer  Im planning on upgrading bcoz I have last years 14 pro   Snapchat ig  iMessage are extremely demanding applications  definitely worth the investment need to futureproof till next Septemberas a consumer I need crony capitalism to take advantage of my lack of brain cells so I can feel valid againIm a fan of apples consistency especially when it comes to lack of innovation  having outrageous prices  Shut up  take my money
Camp dont care at all  I upgrade my phone every 6 years or so currently running a one plus 9 and have no reason to upgrade
Hey Marques thanks for the video and congratulations on the shout out at the event One thing you did not mention unless I missed it was recording video directly to external storage  Yes it is basically just a USBC feature for the pros but thats pretty big I think
Ive watched every Apple launch event for over a decade but didnt even know there was an event yesterday or whenever it was Ill buy every 4th iPhone because I know what Google does with my data but the company has killed any excitement I have for their products
I love that there is no banger this year so that I can keep my 4 yr iPhone lifecycle and see what comes next year without being greedy for a new phone this year 
OMG the big news on iPhone 15 is the new Usb C port go right ahead and buy it
Its not bleeding edge stuff we havent seen before and then immediately goes on to talk about the A17 Pro the first smartphone SOC with hardware accelerated raytracing Raytracing alone is bleeding edge tech Having it on a smartphone GPU running complex engines at 30 FPS is the definition of bleeding edge tech
Looking to upgrade from the 10r to the 15 I believe it will be a good improvement
I really wish they wold do a new design im over the iPhone look
Cant lie this years launch was a MAJOR disappointment I dont understand why Apple cannot give features that other companies have been giving for YEARS like fast charging backtoback charging a higher optical zoom more customizable home screen and so much more Most people around me who use Apple but have been disappointed the past few years have cited the Apple environment as the only reason for not switching to android For me thats the reason Im not getting into Apple I dont wanna buy products of a company which make it inconvenient for me to leave them when I start hating their products
"mkbhd this time Apple has released very boring colour Why didnt they release Product RED colour 

They discontinued Blue in iPhone 15 and purple colour in iPhone 15 pro"
The same phone I stay with Samsung for now
USB c says to me  wait until all apple products are usb c  apple continues to disappoint 
The only thing I see me liking thats new with this iPhone besides the USBC change is the customizable button Now Im not sure I understood you clearly does it always still function like a mute switch by just holding it down for onoff and just tapping it activates what youve programmed it to do or do you have to choose between having it programmed as a mute switch or one of the other functions If its the latter then its utter trash and theyve made a silly mistake
One think I havent heard anyone talk about is how Apple harped on using recycled materials in the new products which means theoretically their cost to produce goes down but they didnt pass those savings on to consumers 
I get everyone has a preference but I will never understand how iPhone users can put up with Apples condescending approach to improving their products
Not enough to make me buy it
I miss the s lineup cause this one would fall under the iPhone 14s Pro
Why does Apple limit charging speed to 20W Well faster charging options would be nice but keep in mind it comes at a cost to battery service lifetime The faster you charge a battery the more stress it puts on the battery Also 20W is still a lot of power used to be standard to charge a phone with 5W and the much larger iPad battery with 12W But yeah if your phone is dead right before you go to do something it can feel like magic to get a few hours of charge from just a few minutes plugged in
LOL 
imagine being able to charge ALL your apple devices with one USBC cable 
Honestly seeing them put the USB3 speeds on the Pro models is great I cant complain about them here especially since the general consensus from the web was that theyd not bother supporting it with all cables In reality some USBC cables wont support the faster speeds Glad the EU forced their hand tbh its about time professionals using their iPhones get faster readwrite speeds to other devices
Wow 43 mil views in 12h is insane
Bro it IS just the USBC Rest is literally the same buch of chip and camera upgrades we are dripfed every year
The Plus is actually worth it this time around The 14 plus was a joke lol
When you need to make a video to tell people 15 and 14 are not the same this is a really big problem
Maybe this has had a little influence The European Union imposes a universal USBC type charger for all devices from 2024
Im looking forward to WiFi 6E support
Marques the replaceable back glass is not that small of a change If you needed to replace the back glass for 14 Pro and earlier models it would be a Rear System replacement which includes everything but the battery and camera system Now its just the glass big change in the chassis
So basically its the same phone from the last year it comes with USBC and thats all Apple is really killing the game and betting on stupidity of its customers
This was the lamest iPhone debut ever keeping my 13
Which type c cable should i use  Is there MFI certified type c cable for iPhone 15  If i use type c cable and its not MFI certified then it will ruin my battery health
704 noticeably lighter Its 172 vs 171 grams dude
iPhone 15 pro totally not worth it that action button is lame pathetic overall imo very lack luster
Currently holding a 13 Pro Im very excited for the upgrades in the 15 Pro Mostly USBC and the brightness 
same thing every day and people pay alot just for some fame clout from others what is wrong with you people
Bro test AAA games on pro version 
Definitely upgrading pro max
looking forward to seeing the huawei phone 
No iPhone mini again
I feel like if I had a regular 14 Id upgrade to the 15 because of the camera  Just dont see enough to make me want to bother upgrading from the 14 pro though  First time in a while thats been the case  At least now I can pay this phone off and see if the 16 pro is worth it  Not surprised that companies like Apple are starting to run thin on new phone innovations though
Will stay on my 13 Pro nothing that is worth to switch over
With everything apple does to these youtubers do you really think their opinions arent biased
Basically a pointless update
Being 100 the two reasons why I am upgrading to the 15Pro Assassins Creed Mirage on iPHone and USB C This alone kept me from going back to Android
cause EU told sololololol
Fast refresh rate missing in iphone 15 makes me to stay with Android S22 or s23 may get very cheap soon making good deal Iphone 15 is still no match for these phones
Marques Im leaving this comment here because I doubt Ill ever be able to tell you in person I didnt click on this video because I am interested in the subject Im not I clicked on this video because its you Im proud to see you doing your thing and am happy to check you out for it
I would say Im in camp unmoved  I have an iPhone pro max and this doesnt make we want to upgrade
APPLE build time machine  Hires design team from the 1910s  
I get it an iphone is an iphone But people getting hyped by type c port these days Really Tech innovation is indeed flattening atleast more for the iphone dept at Apple maybe
Hardware Raytracing But damn not many games though
Europe won lets go
Fast charging will be iPhone 16pro and then iPhone 17
I guess Im in camp dont care at all I just upgraded from an iPhone XR to an iPhone 13 and have no plans to upgrade again for at least 45 years I watched the Wonderlust event and didnt really see anything that made me want to go out and get an iPhone 15 at any of its price points
Its nothing crazy new but the pro looks really really nice
Im surprised you like the titanium over the Matt black 
Im more excited about that new anker power bank you showed than the new iPhones lol
awesome video as always but its gonna have to be a hard pass for me this year gonna stick to the iphone 14 pro and hope for something better next year
Im waiting for the reviews but to be honest Ill probably jump from my 6 year old 7 Plus to a 15 Pro Max and then just use that for the next 56 years
I bought a 100w charger from Amazon so I charge like in 30 mins to 80
Does picklaterportrait not eliminate the need for a dedicated portrait mode
"Yayyyyy Apples successfully launched the mobile digital camera with attached phone function This mobile digital camera has been upgraded many features that it could compete with Nikon Sony and other popular brands in photovideo devices

Seriously only greatness upgrade is great camera features"
Marques Brownlee DID APPLE FLY YOU IN
48 Megapixel chip haha 301
Lol same phone 
Apple discovered macros w0w action button my favorite feature can you be more of a fanboy
the iPhone 15 Pro but with some of the software features of Pixel copy text from everywhere is sooo useful and convenient and a 2in1 360 touch mac would be perfect i love touchscreens on laptops even without the 360 hinge
Why do they keep releasing the same phone every year Why not hold off 23 years then give us something extraordinary Youre just spending money on the aestheticshowing of having the newest iphone
Love this so muchhh ima get the 15 pro but keep the reviews comingggg
Customisable button is amazing but removing the mute switch Ouch
Can you set a timer for the mute button so that the ringer will come back on later
No fair Marques ANY phone in your hands makes the phone feel small and makes you want to get the bigger size
If there were no Eu regulations apple would never made it with usbc port
Apple loves to copy and paste
Lame It looked like you could only map the button to what Apple says its suitable
"Ill definitely be preordering on Friday jumping from our 13
Pro Max over the 14 Pro Max first time ever well be missing a series but not our choice Verizon changed their payment plans to 36 months causing us to wait 6 months longer to upgrade than our usual 12 month upgrade"
whats the price
Airpods pro 2 is lightning
Same old same old  Trickle down upgrades so apple which profits them and dumb consumers continue to spend yearly instead of waiting min of three years before they do again dumb consumers lol
The 12x 15x and 2x feature is AWESOME for photographers who prefer a 28mm 35mm or 50mm equivalent focal length I personally do not care for the 24mm equivalent focal length  its too wide for the type of photography I do I have 28mm and a 50mm equivalent prime lenses for my mirrorless camera 50mm equiv typically 2x is an underserved focal length on smartphones considering how iconic it is in photography Same for 35mm though thats not my goto
As someone whos been on a Samsung s10 for the past 4 years and i loved it Im pretty excited for the whole usb type c change Ive needed to switch over to apple because of an app thats ios exclusive and i use it everyday Itll just be a thing to make my job easier but at least i dont gotta buy a new charger lol
MKBHD just hates the iPhone We get it bro youre a droid guy
the action button is basically the bixby button just more proof apple lovers will love anything apple makes even if they talked it down when others did it years before
Everybody always says thinner bezels Does this mean one day the screen will over lap the side of the phone down the road I do not think these can keep getting thinner unless we are taking measurement in fermi or some other smaller unit
apple can do all those upgrades now but then they will scratch their head looking for new ideas for the future iPhones
Trash Selling iSheep the same phone over and over and over and over and over Apple is the worlds biggest pimp
I really dont need one but Im getting one
47 million views 12 hours
so are we in 2015
I just got the 14 pro max and its like I only see a charging port charge and a switch to a button nothing major at all
What happened to double tap on the back of the phone It was something like the action button
Besides the new Iphone the real telenovela is how this quote to Marques is going to influence his community and the relations that the manufacturers have to reviewers    He had to be in a polite way hard on the new changes  Lets see what happens  As always is a high quality video made by Marques
"usbc iphone
shut up and take my tradein"
I probably havent watched a phone review from you in a while but this was very very unmotivating lol Almost like Hey nothing new here but I still have to do a review lol  And that in itself is also a powerful review
Its the same phone since the iPhone 6 Only now with a USB c Apple sucks
This year they really got me 15 Pro Max is really exciting I dont even like big screens I upgraded more than a year ago from a 11 Pro max to just a 13 Pro because I was tired of having a massive screen but the new camera system is near perfect I love the telephoto feature But Im still thinking however that its freaking embarrasing how much they charge for extra storage Where the hell are these guys taking the nands from From the earths core Ill only get the 256GB model which happens to be enough But Ill never buy a Mac because they have the same base storage and its just NOT acceptable for a Mac macOS cant even exist without annoying the user in just a few months if you dont have at the very least a 512GB SSD which is a 200 upgrade and thats called scam
Really disappointed with this year
Camp Android but sooo happy FINALLY USBc on the phones I feel like them being forced they gave the bare minimum for USBc Might try one out
No 120hz
Marques just be honest and tell straight Apple you suck by leaving usb2 in your phones
Im very tired of fact that theres new iPhone every year 
Real question is why is Apple still launching IPhone 11 again and again for 5th time
in the EU usbc is mandatory from 2024 That is why everything now gets usbc with apple
"I like the new button on the Pro models but I dont like that they got rid of the mute switch Its one of those unique things that I genuinely like about iPhones 

At least the functionality is still there as its set to work as a mute button by default but something about that physical switch was so tactile You always knew what mode it was in without having to look at the screen Very useful as most situations where you want your phone muted you probably dont want your phone out let alone be caught looking at it With the switch you can just put it on mute or even just double check that its muted without even taking it out of your pocket"
cool thing 60hz display Apple invented it
iPhone 15 kab relice hoga 
Hey Marques been watching you for a while and now Ive subscribed good stuff thought I subbed long ago I watched your Tesla solar panel roof and 3 batteries one year later review I found it very informative I was just thinking how about adding the new Archimedes windmill to your system or at least doing a review of that product Jersey is not the windiest but I think it would still be interesting and informative kind of your niche
The raw titanium look reminds me of the HTC One M8 I miss that thing
The best thing from the Apple event is their absolutely wildly cringy environmental video The virtue signaling was truly top tier 
Im good with my 14 pro max in Space Black Its so sexy The only thing missing for me will be the lighter feel of the 15 pro max because that is about my only gripe with my phone is how heavy it is  and oh plus Apples restrictive boring iOS 
The camera focal length was mentioned in the event
action button was soooo 2017
Action button shouldve mapping for a double press dumb devs
Ive been on android for like 12 years now Making the switch to iPhone exclusively for the apple watch What I cant decide is what version I want Idk if I really care about the pro max feature set
Short explanation Wait till next year to get a better iphone
USB 20 on an 800 phone That technology is from the year 2000 probably not faster than the lightning port  They could at least have put a usb 31 gen 1 controller in there to get acceptable speeds And then apparently they put a usb 20 cable into the iPhone 15 Pro that supports USB 31 gen 2  By the way they could also have put usb 31 gen 2x2 for that price
can the action button be used as a shutter button for the camera
Marq i think something is wrong with your colour ballance you look yellow
pot kak
"The headline feature is a feature that should have been part of the family many years ago 
The fancy camera ensures the sleek design is useless since it really requires a bulky case for the real world 

Andit is expensive Not for me but have no doubt the lifelong apple devotees will buy these by the millions"
Was this video instructor Burlachers bro I had someone send a PDF about a new feature on Youtube video creators Anyway Why did Apple not upgrade the product Just always the inside Although we do not have proof Who knows if they always make an fast iPhone with just a extra circuit board resistors and then the Upgrade was just the same new phone with remove a 1 resistor Oh its faster Anyway Without further adeu When they can break the mold of design and forefront thinking Every product in this new economy was perfect copies was the ideal amount Additionally Why would my Porsche model Blackberry outdated No It still had fast cars So iPhone can offer a better model of each design was 1 of 1 exterior artwork Where is it Do we always have to just drop test to get this unique design with its own personal scratches Then I can play Overwatch finally on the Ghz processor right Marques
No 120 Hz on an iphone in 2023 is just CRAZY
With universal charging cable this means less metric tons of Ewaste
My favorite part of the whole Apple event was the meeting with Mother Nature
finally a custom button function that I could have downloaded in the play store
In camp I wish I could afford anyone of it 
Youve asked so here it is dont care at all   Waiting for your Pixel 8 reviews great content
Anker is sus dude Anker steals and sells people data Linus tech tips stopped their affiliation with Anker
Apple to late Samsung is way better 
"Wait Lightning was already USB

Lightning was just USB as a proprietary connector which was unnecessary or at least has been since the typec connector became available on consumer devices around the time the nexus 6p was released"
Thats why Samsung S23 Ultra is the best iPhone is so boring looks the same every year
Why are they using that crap c port
WAIT THE FAST CHARGING IS GONE ON 15
THE MAIN CAMERA IS NOT A BIGGER SENSOR THAN THE 14 PRO 48PM MKBHD DOESNT KNOW WHAT THE HECK HE IS TALKING ABOUT
I think there will be a non pro chip in coming years and they will use pro chip for pro iphones and non pro chip non pro iphones gut feeling says this will not go longer to use one year old chip in non pro iphones lets see
Love that he got a shout out from Tim Cook during the event
Im definitely in the Getting one of these camp Im going to trade in my 12 pro for a 15 pro and using my carriers trade in deal itll only cost me 200 or less because my carrier hasnt stated the trade in value themselves only through Apples site
My boy done made it Congrats
The pros are just 14s
Its really a 14s
Id like to be able to set different action button behaviour for each focus mode
This is a dying brand excellent video as always Very detailed
So traditionally im always a few generations behind on iPhones Didnt see the advantage of getting the new one every year I was happily staying on the S line and upgrading every 2yrs Then I went from iPhone 8 to 11 pro max huge upgrade love my phone it does everything I need it to finish the day with more than 70 battery I plug in for CarPlay I always watch the keynote for entertainment and potential upgrades the 15 USBC and some camera stuff 1400 No doubt its a bump from 11 but not sure it makes a lot of sense for me ill wait for reviews but I think im skipping it again this year which is a shame as I like new toys So keeping my m1 iPad Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max AirPods Pro 1st gen M1 iMac Ultra watch 1st gen all for another year
Usb c being the major upgrade on an iphone Its so ridiculous that feels like a scam
The most boring Apple Keynote ever imho no real innovations Apple Watch is overdue to get the squared edge design
How easy is it to switch between 1x 12x  15x inside the camera app You showed in Settings  then switching between 5x 1x  3x but Im wondering do you have to longpress on the 1x inside the Camera app to get to 12x15x Or is it only in settings to toggle between those
I drop my 14 pro max CONSTANTLY and Im 64 Its always well above 4 foot drops This thing does not break Its insane My point is I honestly doubt the new one is stronger just because of titanium Bit lighter is definitely better
Tell me you changed nothing without telling me you changed nothing
2023 and they just got USBC Apple Sucks
Guess Im waiting for the Iphone 16 with actual upgrades lol love your content and your amazing camera
"USBC is a big deal Its the same as when all devices short of apple used to use micro USB Much easier to carry around one cable that can charge everything 

USBC on the newer IPads was a phenomenal addition Never had to worry about carrying multiple cables on trips The point isnt the weight its having to remember several different cables every time you go on a trip 

Perfect example Wife and I went on a trip she forgot her lightning cable to charge her IPhone Luckily I had remembered to bring it Had i not  shed be shit out of luck unless we found a lightning cable somewhere in some gas station Wed be able to charge my Samsung phone her IPad but not her phone Having one cable that does it all also makes it easier to just stash multiple cables in different areas as back ups Sure can technically do the same with both Lightning and USBC But having ONE cable saves you a ton of money Cables can get expensive"
indian pricing is not good 999 for us and  1627base for india wtf
After watching this Im in camp dont care at all but ima get one eventually
Cool glad not enough has changed and I get to keep ignoring every product apple releases
i never use a case and always believed that the ringer should never be on a switch now that i can make it do sometbing else i can comfortably sit in class and not worry about my phone goong off
Usb 20 speeds in 2023  Welcome to 2010 in Apple world
Hey Marques  the only reason I buy the Pro models is for the telephoto lens However with the new 48MP camera in the nonPro Apple is touting optical quality 2x zoom Please dig into this in your indepth review and let us know if thats legit
Still waiting for under screen camera and maybe Touch ID
Very exited for iPhone 15 pro
"Everyone be complaining how Apple doesnt innovate even though they really dont care about what Samsung does 

Theyll just buy the s23u and forget about all the added stuff and use it as a regular phone

I think the iPhone 15 is quite nice despite the minimal changes its great that someone finally forced them to use usb c while utilizing it only on the pros though my only complaints are the washed out colors and no fast charging

However despite all the prices staying the same except for the pro max being 100 more Apple and Samsung need to fix their prices its literally too expensive and I know those phones are really not worth that much

The only prices I can say are good is the Pixel 7 and the Pixel 7 pro and the upcoming 8s plus you get stock android with no duplicate default apps unlike Samsung"
Standard iPhones will get USB3 next year then Pros will get Thunderbolt speed 
Im in the how much will a 14 pro drop to and then make my decision camp Nothing was exceedingly awesome about the 15 pro I think I might go one or 2 more years with Lightning
It would be nice if you could double tap or triple tap the new button so you could have different set ups for use Using just 1 click on it makes it limited and most of us will probably keep it at the silent button
I appreciate your video but I fortunately am very happy with my 14 Pro Max so no need to upgrade this year Maybe next year
Usb type C from Apple it like driving a Ferrari in the city but not allowed to drive it on the highway LOLL 
Big meh I think Apple is done innovating for their phones
how is it determined which device at the either end of type will be charged and from which once power will be taken
Will be upgrading from my 13 pro to the 15 max
So the new pro models let you write to an external drive but cant do fast charging still 
First time I felt Mrwhosetheboss did a better job with the new iPhone video vs MKBHD
no fast charging tf
No fast charging is unacceptable 25w why I would never go back to iPhones
I currently have the 13pro max 256gb  I will be getting the iPhone 15 67 inch 256gb  I dont need all of the camera features but I definitely like the dynamic island and the updated charging
I am curious about what the iPhone will change the production workflow Like external recording or move huge ProRes clips from iPhone to Mac or PC
USBC is the big new feature  odd and disappointing  Not that iPhones arent great mobile computing devices just that Apple had to be forced into adding this aging feature to their phones  The EU was correct about this one as this resistance to use industry standards has had a cost to consumers especially  considering how short lived many of Apples relatively expensive cables were and increased the production of excess waste
"I love how the big thing on this phone is a different shaped charging port and a new type of button 

This tech really is hitting its ceiling"
Now you can customize the action button for example to open the camera But for a non iPhone user like I am Was there all those years no other shortcut to open the camera
Every colour this year is absolutely awful
Apple are disappointing every time
A good new feature on the new iPhone would be a longer call list
"I wish there was half a million views per hour on videos about how the elites are screwing the masses 
Klaus Schwab WEF Assange Manning Snowden 15 minute cities gain of function research Vanguard BlackRock Bilderberg Group CBDC Monsanto  glyphosate chemtrails  Just start looking avoid the iPhone launch distractions"
 Wow a new camera  Tack my money   No thanks
I will probably upgrade to one of these phones most likely the 15 Id love to finally have the 48 MP camera
Im waiting for the pixel 8 and see what they have install for us Android users Not gonna lie those iPhone battery life are much better
"This years line up winner is the iPhone 15 pro
Followed by the iPhone 15
Pro max is forcing you to spend more to get bigger size so for the size the 15 plus is the third place"
The question is  will you really update your phone this year 
was thinking to upgrade this year from my 11 still not super sure yet on what is the best plan forward but really excited by their keynote yesterday
I want IPhone mini
If the pro was pink I wouldve upgraded
Love watching the newest cutting edge phones happily on my S10 
Apple still not adding ProMotion to the base iPhone 15 is a huge middle finger along with the USB2 speeds For so long iPhones used to have very similar hardware and features but the size and camera was what differentiated them Now its all different across the board which just seems boring and confusing for average consumer Only the Pro Max having the 10x zoom feels like an insult to whoever gets the regular pro when these are such expensive models This trickle of minor features is very frustrating to see since it will just be adopted by others Maybe next year they will add fingerprint reader on the power button
i hate apple but if u not getting this one you gay
"Youre welcome

Sincerely the EU"
Tim cook is out of touch
Sooo the same iPhone but at a ridiculous price no thanks
When will people realize android will always be superior
Apple couldve waited a year to switch to USBC but my personal theory is that the first port change was from the 4S to 5 so the second port change is from the 14 to 15
Thank you EU 
I love watching your videos I enjoy hearing you because your voice is very soothing
"The real gem was Steve Jobs 
I phone is just the product 
Hoping for more innovation from apple "
My 13 pro maxs Pro motion display and battery life are great  I only use cameras for documents and random stuff no new features in 15 some more  crap
Ive been waiting on his review of the iPhone 15 such great detail thanks bro 
MrWhosTheBoss said exactly the same thing about dropping the iPhone 14 on the ground without a case and nothing happening Are you guys reading from the same script
So were still stuck with 60hz on the regular iPhone 15 sheer audacity  as usual
Titanium looks weird
Why are you in denial though
camp dont care at all
No 40 gig speed no fast charging no 1inch sensor and what we have in the past 4 years from Apple Phone technology is almost dead Apple has stopped innovating
EU forced the usb c change on Apple with a hefty fine So thats the EU looking after consumer interest
I think the iPhone became boring and irrelevant
Watching this on my Fold 5 and just laughing to apples crappy technologies 
I miss the Bixby Button on my S10 Action button was so underrated
iOS 17 is low key more compelling than iPhone15 
youre literally being sold the same phone just usbc 
no matter how enthusiastically you described the new ones iPhone 15 lineup is even more boring than last year But I understand you You just want to keep the free stuff flowing
iPhone soooo boring since the 7th iPhone
its just the same thing Looks like iphone 14 and 13 and 12 same thing
What about battery capacity 
Im in camp want one but cant afford it
nothing new same old crap  android had for years Team Android
Definitely getting the 15 gonna put the 13 out to pasture 
Yeah Not upgrading until I see a foldable screen Or like the ability to project images Oooh also an iPhone that floats in the water Or maybe just a foldable screen 
Youve always been able to use a USBClightning cable and charge iPhone from iPad or vise versa  Whichever you plug in first is the wall the other is the device  Try to been doing it since iPad Pro went USBC
usbc was not an Apple decision it was the EU So no real new feature this year 
"titanium does make it stronger its lighter which means less force when dropped from the same height and titanium will flex less which means less energy gets transmitted to the screen if it drops on the edge so your screen is less likely to crack So this may actually have a fairly major positive impact
Also Ironically Im actually glad theres no fast charging
Fast charging destroys batteries although I suppose having the option to fast charge once or twice would be nice
But I hate it when phones by default fast charge significantly reducing their longevity"
camp dont care at all save the planet
Overpriced crap x15
Not going to buy it not a great difference as last year definitely going to wait for 16
Dang it I fell asleep last night waiting for this to show up oh well better late than never I guess 
Im in the middle  i think the 5x on the camera is a big deal if it performs well At the same time I really wish it was somehow 10x but there are a lot of common situations in which 5x would still be really useful
Old wine in a new bottle 
Im totally getting one Only because my iPhone 11 Pro Max is starting to get old Its cracked on both sides and otherwise Id just keep it until something monumental comes out from Apple
I am still in the Android camp and dont plan on switching now but I am excited to see what the new accessories will be like since more companies can advertise to both ecosystems now
Bro is a good writer and a cameraman but doesnt understand physics which is apparent Titanium is substantially harder than steel so is a drop bends the steel edge which will shatter the glass the same drop wont bend titanium edge and it will bounce instead hence the glass will survive More over titanium wont scratch easily
I would have loved to see an alwayson display on the base iPhone 15 models Its just one of those features that seems like it should be available as the base nonSE Apple Watches have had it for years now Why shouldnt the iPhone
It makes sense that they did not include fast charging Including fast charging would be admitting that the Lightning port was indeed holding them back AND it would kill their argument that they were actually preserving the battery It would be very unApple to include this feature most people actually want
This is insane i love this phone never will be able to afford it but its cool
pause 1041 why smartphone all about camera now when i was young i had canon the best like if u hate nikon
Ill be skipping the iPhone 15  Theres not enough improvements vs the 14  I would still have the 13 but Always On Display was the one feature I missed most from Android so took that upgrade option
Wonder if Marques and Arin met up while they were both there
im probably gonna keep using my 6s until 2025 or 2026 to get an iphone with a replaceable battery thanks eu
Since I have the 14 Pro Max Ill probably pass on this one and upgrade next year
reverse charging is pretty neat Do we know if we have the previous airpods with lightning can we use USBC to lightning cables to charge
Isnt it a USBC only for Apple devices It says somewhere you cant use any USBC cable only apple provided one
Hey i got a big warning to all of my fellow android users now that Apple is adding the USBC to their new phones make sure that you hide your phone charger from now on and if you are in public dont let your charger sitting anywhere because the Apple users will steal it so they dont have to buy a charger of their own and NEVER allow the apple users to barrow your charger
Boring phones They have been for years
Ive got a 13 Pro Max and hadnt considered upgrading until now I think that Ill be pulling the trigger on Friday Also debating a tradein
"So the B in MKBHB stands for Business Class 
I will buy the 15 Pro Max 512GB in the natural titanium color Nice Video btw as usual"
Why did I get a Samsung advertisement on the starting of the video 
EUROPEAN UNION FOR THE WIN
lol when having a standard USB port is the highlight you know the product isnt that special
Why add fast charging when you plan on removing the port in a few years anyway
"Me personality nothing changed from iPhone 14 pro besides some action buttons and usbC
Paying over 1000 and all is that No thank you am okay with my 12 pro max still"
Maybe the action button could open Google Assistant
"If you have IPhone 14 skip IPhone 15 
IPhone 14 is very highl quality phone that can take you another 2 yrs easy"
Hello Cool video For me the biggest announcement was SPATIAL VIDEO Is there any reason why you dont mention it
USB C wasnt added by choice they had to add it due to European law lol
Soooooits the same thingwith a USB connectionyeahhhh
"Mkbhd Yeah theres some small changes

Apple engineer  all we did was roll over last years design 

"
Seriously people why do you still buy iPhone
1000 The only thing that has me scratching my head is they allow that customization but does it recognize double taps holds versus single tap If so that would be a next level of customization that we have NEVER seen in an iPhone before Ill still never buy one but it could help me make the lives of my parents easier with their iPhones
Nothing motivates me to move to 15 pro  I an happy with 14 pro
No fast charging on the new IPhone 15 is a deal breaker for me Ill stick to charging my phone in 3040mins for another year with the 14 thanks
Apple is shameful
Looks like you have to buy a max pro version to get a silent mode icon Wish they put it on small screens as well
Dankoo means thank you  definitely not upgrading 
Old wine new bottle  simple 
An Apple enthusiast is not a mammoth 
THE MAIN QUESTION What about the RAM size on 15 vs 15 Pro 
Plzzz
Not even close to worth it if you bought a 14 Pro
Samsung has done the make a photo portrait later for like two years now and I dont remember anyone anyone talking about that in their videos I get ot iphones are good But really they keep coming late to the party and nothing is new and innovative anymore Disappointing
Dont know why but i feel like one of my old phones had this Customizable Button feature already corresponding to any Setting that we can pick and chose And i remember using it for clicking PHOTOS WITHOUT UNCLOCKING THE PHONE OR SWITCHING THE SCREEN ON for like cliking some candid photos or clicking a hummingbird before it flies away
boring now dont get me wrong love apple have all their products but it is getting boring now
Camp totally getting the new pro Like it 
Thing is we all know Apple will find enough room in the 16 pro to fit the 5x camera
Customizable side button and usbc The iPhone is turning into a Samsung Bummer there is not fast charging
Hi Marques I am a 10yr android user and currently got the S21Ultra Based on your future iphone pro review i will decide if i want to jump ship to the apple ecosystem No pressure
Im definitely getting one The 3D video camera is my favorite new feature on it
335 Blur background later Amazing Wow hate to be that guy but Pixel has been able to do this for a while
And a big TCook shoutout to MKBHD Appreciate your stuff bro
Been on the iPhone 11 Pro so Im interested on getting the 15 pro 
Ive got the 14 Pro Max Ill wait up to see the reviews to know whether its worth switching
Literally no change whatsoever I dont need to upgrade my 13 pro max I expected atleast some fast charging to be introduced
800 for a smartphone whose main features are slow USB Type C a 60Hz display and reversewired charging  Kudos to Apple Milk every penny out of us
Fun fact in my country you can pay a year of rent with the same money you would buy the 15 pro max
Pathetic upgradefooling peopleSamsung is way aheadgrow up Apple
its disappointing for me what made me upgrade my iPhone was the incremental camera update I always looked at Apples OS an easier way to manage camera settings I look at comparable Android systems like Sonys and an more interested in their camera integration I really hoped 15 would offer something different but it seems I will stay on my 13 Pro for a while 
256gb of storage on a pro max in 2023 
Stronger faster better picture etc are buzz words for people who dont understand technology Like our brain we barely use 10 of the capabilities of these phones on a daily basis It will not make any difference whether we upgrade or not If this was the sole device we only use than it makes sense however everyone has a laptop tablet etc Using my Iphone 11 pro max for more than 3 years and still cant justify an upgrade It works as much as I need it to even today Its a flaw among humans constant need of consuming new things whether we require or not False sense of accomplishment
I think the wow factor has certainly decreased with iPhones now am thinking to get one of the folds or flips as primary phone and continue with my iPhone as a secondary device
Bill Gates is turning in his graveApple is getting worse w timeNOTHING new   The USB C was because the Euro Union compelled them to put it if they wanted to sell their stuff in the EU
One TB isnt enough 
Fawning over or yawning over iPhone new release  Zzzzz
is the baseline iphone 15 compatable with an iphone 14 case
Nothing to be impressed about them Im just glad they have usbc now Im keeping my 14 pro until 18 comes out
Upgrading from the 11 pro to the 14 pro max I have far too many lightning accessories to go to the 15
I have the 14pro max I preferred the 13 over the 14 maybe if I woulda kept the 13 Id upgrade to the 15pro max but until then Im riding it our
I can wait till the 16th
Wish that slide to unlock feature come back
No iPhone 15 ultra I heard they were going to call one that
im an apple user but apple  
 I have been waiting for your video about new iphone and it sounds like i need to wait more i want all the DETAILS of the camera pro max if i cant take a picture of the moom still i will stick with a galaxy
USB c breaks too easy they shouldve kept the lightning cable
The most honest review you can ask for Great job dude
I will get that in a moment  I will get that in a moment I will get that in a moment It looks like all tech YouTubers are joining this trend and it sucks
whats really upsetting is that 15 is still 60Hz
"Apple is a Joke
Not only USBC Yes and 60hz display Scamphone"
For those of us looking to switch to iPhone from Android this is pretty underwhelming
Ive fallen victim to the Apple upgrade ladder I normally get 256gb pro but at the same price as the pro max this year plus extra battery and focal length Im picking up the pro max this time around
Wow  you mean  people who are the in crowd  have now  caught up  to Vortex a company who makes phones for people  with  E B T SANP benefits   charging speed    Verry impressive  APPLE  LOL  
upgrading from 12pro  I want the 5x zoom but unwilling to carry such a big phone 15pro it is  with all the carriers giving 1000 trade in on the 12pro its a no brainer
Im tempted to upgrade but I might just hold on to my 12 Pro Max
Now everyone gets aux in one cable in the car finally 
Still rocking my iPhone 7
So basically we have 4 ways of going to the camera 
My finger automatically hits the dislike button everytime I see a video sponsored by Anker
If Apple gave you all the Fast charging and USB speeds at once what would they include in the next iPhone upgrade 
Have been watching Apple events regularly without ever buying any of the Apple products till date
I prefer sim tray than USB port
Could never justify the price for a phone personally
"why the hinges of folding phones are not made with titanium it will less weight and more strong too
second phone after essential phone to use titanium next all the companies from samsung are going to follow the same
titanium is going to be the new standard of highend phones
looking foward for titanium ipads and samsung tab ultras"
"The new natural titanium color on the pro iphones is fricken sick Im not gonna buy it because what the hell do i need a pro phone for especially since i couldnt care less about camera features and would rather have a cleaner one lense design instead but still its nice

The action button is cool too but the mute switch is so ubiquitous with iphone at this point that it will take some getting used to"
iPhone 15 impossible to justify an upgrade from the 14 lmao
Steve Jobs is rolling over in his grave the most disappointing apple invent in history What the hell has apple been doing all year Forced USBC and spatial video for there over priced vision pro goggles Apple needs a new CEO
Im switching back to iPhone after using a Galaxy S21 for 25 years Definitely excited
Im still upset they ditched the mini model guessing theyll brand the smaller form factor as the new SE but well see
No fast charging 
That Titanium Blue is a winner Im going for it
Never been impressed with apple I feel they give the bare minimum features consumers really need and want This just adds on
PLZ BRO HELP ME SEND ME A GOOD PHONE I WANNA START STOCK TRADING AND I DONT HAVE A GOOD ELCTRONIC AM USING A LAPTOP TO DO IT AND ITS SO SLOW AND CRASHES NOTHING CAN BE DONE PLZ BRO HELP I LIVE IN UGANDA AND MY FAMILY IS TOO POOR TO AFFORD IT PLZ HELP ME
Na i amm wait for 16 This isnt exciting
If I didnt have the 13 mini I would not buy this
bro this dude is always  buying the new phones like what you do with all the iPhones you have bought 
but it is just usb c tho lol
I have the 14 pro max 256GB I dont think I will be upgrading
I plugin my phone every day i dont have a wireless charger
What a boring iPhone 
Apple will come out with fast charging when Samsung comes out with a self charging battery
i can now buy a 14 pro and not feel like im missing much
iPhonesiOS are just so stale now its frustrating But Im so invested in the ecosystem that I just cant get myself to change
Surprised how you didnt mention the Gaming Aspect of the iPhone 15 Pro You will now be able to play games such as Assassins Creed Mirage and RE 4
The phones have been getting heavier and heavier over the years so hopefully now that the 15 is very marginally lighter the trend will continue Not into carrying something that feels like a brick in my pocket  Really the only thing I care about at this point and making them drop resistant so we dont need bulky cases USB C only matters to people who dont already have a bunch of lightning cables around imo
I wanted to get it but I really like that my current iPhoen 11 still can lay flat on the desk without ugly camera bump The only thing is I scratched it within first month so I live with this  tiny but long scratch across the screen for years Got used to it but it reminds me that even I can be clumsy never scratched a phone in my entire life before since iP 34 
Already have it set for preorder  Have to get the new one every year  I mean why not  Have to have the latest and best   
And there will still be millions of fanboysfangirls to buy those overpriced jokes
I dont see a point to upgrade from 14 max pro
"iPhone 15  it is the same phone from last year ie iPhone 14
iPhone 14  it is the same phone from last year ie iPhone 13
iPhone 13  it is the same phone from last year ie iPhone 12
iPhone 12  it is the same phone from last year ie iPhone 11
iPhone 11  it is the same phone from last year ie iPhone Xs
iPhone XS  it is the same phone from last year ie iPhone X"
Tim just cooked us a bunch of left over food
mkbhd If I have a iPhone 14 does it make sense to upgrade to 15
I dont think you got the relevance of the fact that an iPhone can run AAA games natively
Flossy Carter  hands down the best tech review on YouTube
It is disappointing the action button isnt more customizablelike press once for flashlight hold to open camera double tap to use Siri shortcut etc Just one thing
It looks like an iPhone refresh may possibly take place in 2024 for this more casual iPhone 13 usernice but not motivating
Im with Sony in that by the next 3 years phone will have SLR or better quality photography between sensor lenses the biggest draw back right now and computational power Im interested in the 15 Pro based off the demo shots will wait to see some photographers I know to test in depth If the updated processor creates better depth maps and results with them asking drop off points in edges Id much rather have a 15 pro and a power bank if needed than a phone plus a gr iiix in my pocket Im a photographer from the late 90s but I dont mind using a phone as my tool for walk around if the results work
At 747 I assume you meant to say ground not glass
I have a Samsung S10 and Im only interested in checking out iPhone because they were forced into USBC Probably wait for the 16s to give Apple and accessory partners a chance to fully switch to USBC
Would love one of these im the black sheep of my family so maybe one day Ill get one  Good overview like always 
portrait mode that can be done that feature im having on my pixel 4a 
I was excited to hear type c and fast charging but then hes like no fast charging 
Its obvious to me that Apple doesnt care about their phone line They want to invest where the market is barely touched to make the most money Their VR headset line is all their engineers are forced to work on Doubt well see an Apple folding phone with super fast charging power share and complete app placement freedom on home screens in our lifetimes causewhy should they is where Tims head is at
The biggest update is the USBC lol you nailed it 
13 minutes compressed video is acceptable comparing to the lengthy 85 minutes infomercial from the source
In India flying is still a big thing On my 100th flight which was actually after a gap of about 45 years i thought of filming it I had got the backrow seats as it was a last minute booking And these new kids on the block air hostesses at the back saw me shoo5ing the clouds and whisper FIRST TIMER and started giggling 
you can tell bro be trying his best not to absolutely shit on iphone cuz im sure apple pay him well but he know wassup
Wont care until theres a mini tired of huge phones
i switched last time from the pro max to a pro and had a fair amount of fomsing about it for about 2 weeks until i got used to the slightly smaller form factor fast forward to now I really really dont want a huge phone again but Apple stuck certain camera features in the big phone only I think ill sit this cycle out
Great video as always I think Ill wait till next yearhappy with my 14pro max
"I dont care at all about those USBC ports The only thing really nice about them is that you can charge your AirPods or Watch using your phone For me the main thing is Dynamic Island and better camera on the 15 nonpro 

I just have to figure out now if I wanna replace my 11 Pro with a 15 nonpro or 14 Pro which cost about the same"
TOTALY GETTING THE PRO MAX THIS YEAR COMING FROM A 13 PRO MAX  I UPGRADE EVERY 2 YEARS
you mean when your friend with the Android can now charge your phone
Going to give Iphone another try and going back to Oneplus The Samsung s23 Ultra was straight garbage  Filled with bugs and constant freezing Best thing was maybe how long it lasted on a full battery Phone clarity terrible  Skipping Samsung for a long time Gonna give Apple another chance And back to Oneplus for Android
They should make the portrait mode changes into the new iOS tbh
Same Design Since 11 Pro 
I have custom button mapping on a samsung s8 
iPhone 15 ProMax 512GB for me
Please Fairphone 5 review
Cause faster charge is degradation of the battery faster Slow is better for life
Sad to see the stronger blue color go Great video but hes not right about the glass it is a new formula this year and is much stronger
I finally switching from 18 years of Android to an iPhone
On my 13 and not at all impressed This might be the most minor update ever The only good things was type C and it was just playing catch up to 8 year old phones Might wait and see what samsung is doing Foldables look impressive tbh
"Preordering iPhone pro max on Friday I take a lot of photos so the photo functionality are a plus for me I do wish they had faster charging speeds Thanks for your sponsors Ill check them out
Weirdly I am completely bummed there is not a red color or more of a color
choice in the pro max Im an old grandmother retired from lugging heavy cameras but love to take photos and love color So Im quite excited to check out all the new features and look forward to your future reviews"
About time usbc
The good thing about iPhone getting USB C port is that there will be more and better available options for this cable in the market
Congratulations on your strong following sir Im sure you have improved the quality of life to more people you will ever know
I have the iPhone 13 Im upgrading my wife and I to the iPhone 15 pro max asap
NO FAST CHARGING WHAT
I really thought it had fast charging Bummer
First thing im doing is using the action button as a push to start button for my car im so hype
it looks like samsung is 10 years ahead your buying brand with iPhone but there is no comparison
USBC Wow  Snore Apple is as exciting as apple sauce now Nothing extraordinary And way overpriced
Gotta wait and see what the 16 looks likeits just not enough to upgrade from my 13 Pro Max yet
Im not an iPhone fan But what they have done for the iPhone 15 iPhone 15 pro ect is amazing
I prefer the 13 pro notch  I really like the mute switch on the 13 too
so funny my friend was texting me asking me about what cables he was supposed to buy  He was so confused about USBC  I told him he had been stuck in the dark ages with Apple  HA
But Apple wants to save the world from The Warm so why wouldnt they want ppl to be able to repair their existing devices 
besides USB C and new titanium its the same phone i think ill keep my 14 pro max for 2 more years other changes are software related and no doubt older models like 14 pro max will get support for em in future
lightning are best
Usd 100for 128gb
"44 Million views in just 11 hours
That is just crazy 

Well done Bro"
iphone are made to stay with the phone at least 2 years if you have a 14 is ok you dont need to change but if you have a 11 or 12 is good change IMO
"We all know why Apple didnt go to thunderbolt speed for the pro phonesthe amount of new each year keeps dwindling so they need something for the 2024 lineup

So BRAND NEW IN IPHONE 16 PRO Thunderbolt speeds and super fast charging out of USBC port And USB 3 speeds for nonpro models getting this years chip I could give the keynote now"
Not enough to get rid of my Note20 Great video
Definitely upgrading from my XR I want the big screen but not sure the pro max is worth the extras  compared to the 15 max
Im hoping this leads to a really cheap iphone 1213 mini Mine got water damaged
When are they ditching the pill for under screen First time iPhone user with a 14 Pro Max this year and with these incremental changes it seems Im gonna be upgrading in five years only
dude titled not just ubcc and then begings to rant about usb c this some sleeper content
"Expect thunderbolt in 2025
fast charging 2028   
I have had thunderbolt on my laptop since 2020
fast charging 2020 as well
Apple just recycles old stuff and sells it for a premium 
They want to trap you in their ecosystem and make you dependent on them  
one of the reason I find it difficult to switch and also I dont want to be caved in to ecosystem that will be controling me "
iPhone is boring and Im an iPhone guy
Still its just the same old iphone 14 Nothing great No innovation
No fast charge I guess they want to keep a long battery life to make sure the phones are operating as long as possible Because even used phones will make revenue because of the App Store and iCloud services
Im definitely interested in the pro just for that camera you know for the contact creation
As one who has been using the XS Max for about 5 years now The 15 seems like a good upgrade
Will there be a mini
the issue with the steel edges is not about protection but rather how easily it bends i work at a repair shop and oh boy the number of iphones that come in cause they bend too easilythe logic board is a sandwitch and the phone bending causes it to break apart with ripped pads and loss of functionality aka bluethoot data wifiand more not working having the shroud made out of a material that deforms less easily would help solving the problem cause once its bentit stays bent X
15 pro sucks same thing as the other phones
Been an iPhone user since the 7 Moving back to Android this year for a nostalgia fix with Moto Razr
USB C did it for me Ill be picking up an iPhone 15 as a secondary phone to go with my S23 ultra
If Apple changed the design to say an 8 shape less people would drop it
So basically just keep my iPhone 14 pro Got it
Waiting for iphone 20 pro Max Ultra
Ive had the iPhone X since its release in 2017 so six years with technically the first Pro model  Until the most recent IOS update it was running pretty good now some apps are noticeably laggy Now it is finally time for me to upgrade
shocked they didnt include fastcharging  Might have to wait till they include that
I have always been team Android Samsung to be specific I currently use a fold 4 and I am thinking of switching to an iPhone just to see what the fuss is about but something tells me I will hate it
Fake aperture portrait mode will never replace the real thing
L for Apple
Regarding the action button it would be nice if once you press it the phone displays all the actions that it can perform in a list view and you just choose what you want so that it is programmable to do more than 1 thing
Apple and the lack of innovation
All iPad models have usbC including the baseline model Youre not the first person I heard get this wrong But Im not sure why
This new gen iPhones are totally disappointed The new specs the charging port the price Whats the really new advance upgrade like iPhone or iPhone 44s Apple should invest more money on their technology department So the next gen iPhone wont be just like this small changing And please please apple stop using environment friendly or carbon neutral as selling point You got rid off the charging brick saying people have so many already Now you change the charging port from lighting to usbc Wont that causing people to buy another cable and wasting the old lighting one If they really want to change to usbc they should change it to every products iPad iPhone AirPod promax etc many years ago Not just change some of them first All in all if I can buy Huawei mate 60 pro here I would rather buy Huawei instead iPhone 15 pro max At least I can use satellite phone call on Huawei mate 60 pro with the similar price range maybe cheaper
The focal length preset thing is really cool because I always zoom to 12x by intuition lol
soooo same crap with another connector Btw I do have a 14Pro
So glad the 15 pro max is what it is another year of no payment while I wait for the 16 13 Pro max is just fine
Apple is truly boring but incredibly efficient
waiting for pixel 8 now
Literally no real changes
I have se 2022 I guess its a good time to get iPhone 13 now
Bro belive me or not This upgrade from apple is completely shit Apart from all these shit they must need to concentrate on basic features Which should must have in mobile Specially customization part Which androids giving us full authority to make it personal
Apple tries so hard to sell new iphones that is getting ridiculous Anyways great pieces of tec and great ecosystem fr
Apple only put a usb C because otherwise they cant sell phones in Europe anymore
maybe upgrade from iphone 12 to iPhone 15 Plus looks a good upgrade The lack of lighting is that old ipads are gone and now has to be Ipad air the standard
I was amazed they quoted you in their video
Leave my Android phone alone marques  215
I am still using iPhone X  So yes  Im looking to upgrade this year 
I gonna order a Samsung fold5 sold my 13Pro Max  Apple is getting worse and worse how usb typ c can be an innovation  Samsung has that 7 years  bye bye Apple  liar Company
Companies should wait every 23 years to release new phones Tech isnt worh it every year
Same crap for 4 years
if i have to prepare for my phone to get hot while im otp im good they can do so much but still struggle to fix the most problematic issues like everytime the iphone has an life halting lets be real error prone system its usually around the time theyve announced a new iphone or the fact that my phone continuously has connectivity issues and you could say its because im still rocking the iphone xr but the factors are that i literally have a friend that owns the 14 and is experiencing the exact same issues as me and she literally just got the 14 like 3 or 2 months ago so yea i dont like the idea they know they can fix certain issues but just simply wont to ensure people upgrade i dont like the fact theyre getting away with playing in our faces
Same phone just a different charger
The exact same phone for 4 years in insane to me tbh
ONLY ordering it because my mini 12 is nearing 3 years old and battery is crap otherwise if I could find a 14 Pro at around 700 Id do that instead Also Why is there no longpressshortpress option on the side button it makes sense that the button would remain as close to original muting as possible by short press  but allowing the long press to trigger a shortcut or other app would have been the smarter thing to do Truly this was a VERY MEH event Heres to waiting on the Vision Pro
totally getting it switching from 12 pro so upgrade will be more than small but tbh type C is the main driver as I am tired of everything else being type C but have to have another cable just for the iphone
Yeah I think its a waste of money if you have an iPhone 12 or newer 
"Oh TitaniumI see
It can be the nearby competitor of NOKIA
Lmao but only from the sides "
Watching this on a 25 year old 300 phone and highly doubt Id notice much difference day to day if I upgraded to a modern flagship Looking forward to someone coming out with something truly awesome so I can splurge on it Maybe the next generation of foldables will have something
I was hoping to see a foldable iPhone 15
Event still feels incomplete without Craigs 30
WE SO EXCITED SO EXCITED YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS
Imma pass with iphone 15 Am waiting on IPHONE 30xrl Super pro maxis 588V2 Aw Chip Cant wait yall
No wonder my 11 has been struggling
Buying this and shifting from 12 pro so i need help which is better pro or pro max
pretty cool stuff but I like pixels and ima wait for google to get that tsmc chip out D
Horrible audio quality on the video sound like youre inside a boiler room
Planned obsolescence  trash
Who still uses data cables while you can send photos over WiFi for around 20 years Apple users
I liked the lightning port call me crazy
Just waiting for the day when the back isnt made of glass Ive managed to shatter the back glass while in a case for the past several iPhones
So basically i cant charge my phone in my car anymore no more usb to plug into my car
I have an iPhone 11 Debating to get the 15 pro or the 15it will be nice to know what makes the 15pro stand out even with the titanium the iPhone 15 is lighter and the camera doesnt seem like it has a huge upgrade So besides the action button the telephoto what am I missing
Really looking forward to the pixel 8 release
Cant wait for iPhone to have the multi tasking functions like android has
Total disappointment with Apple They seems to intentionally lower the specs of the nonpro models so as to elevate the lacklustre 15 pro model 
time to retire the Xs
Very nice iPhone 15 pro
I really wish instead of Lenses poking out they just made the phone thicker A thinner phone doesnt matter if lenses are sticking out plus they could use that space for cooling or something
nothing interesting
"Been with iPhone up to iPhone 6 than left it for a Samsung up to Note 8 as got bored with iPhones I got stuck with iPhone 12 Pro Max and to be honest as Im getting older and 12 Pro Max been capable phone with all my needs I just no longer looking for a new technology each year as I use to do
I guess its interesting enough to upgrade now to iPhone 15 Pro Max which will serve me another 34 years also no need to pay 1600 for 1tb when can get sealed brand new one for 1200 from marketplace Also I think the only logical explanation with these every year phones to avoid disappointment  no need to upgrade each year and you are good"
hi guys I have iphone 11 pro Is it worth to upgrade to iphone 14
Wouldve been a nice upgrade coming from the 12 pro but I went for the Z Fold 5 instead
Screen closer to edge is fucking annoying keep having accidental button presses due to to the palm of my hand hits it while scrolling with one hand
Have a 12 pro currently kinda debating whether to hold on another  year or upgrade now I know the camera is a massive jump  but otherwise is there really a point
Steve Sinclair spotted in the background at 1030  Modern version of Wheres Waldo  I worked with him at Mojo and now it looks like he is at Apple again
"What I really want to know is if the change to Titanium makes it so I dont have to cover it up with a case
If I dont have to thats an automatic upgrade for me If I still need a case then its a USELESS feature"
Apple left the USBC port too long Now it is just bleh
Usb 20 for base For real Still no 120hz on base Wth  Lol
Im camp totally getting one of these Im on the 11 Pro Max and stupidly I got it right before the 12 came out BUT I really needed a new phone I really need a new phone now but Im willing to wait this long I can wait until Sept 22nd  great video thanks for the indepth look
Its only now a USBC and repairable due to the European Union warning I wonder how you failed to miss that throughout your blabber
Next MKBHD iPhone video will be like yo iPhone 16 I like the 15 with a new chip named XXX230PRO
So what im really curious about is the battery of the iphone Did they changed it  Because im really tempted to upgrade from a 12 pro but cant find the battery specs
not gonna lie they just add a usb from year 2000 a customizable button and thats all no innovations So youre just buying an Iphone 14 at a bigger price with a usb C if the pro max have some innovations Ill have to change my mind about that but its not worth the money you spend At least with Samsung you see improvements and innovations every years they try new design features technologies and you feel like your money went somewhere
Looks more like android now I think Ill wait till the 16 so they get rid of that notch completely
Ive been upgrading every 2 years On the 13 Pro Max and will most likely upgrade to the 15 Pro Max The 2 year gap between technologies and features makes the new phone feel like a much larger jump then getting a new one once a year
Idk but you sound so disappointed
Like a Boss Tim Cook shouted out your review of the 15 no big deal
Also if anything  I have too many lightening products right now To justify the switch to just one product  Will hold out on the switch
Awesome review now im really looking forward to some deeper analysis of other features like the new DisplayPort capability Spatial Video and Pros real charging capabilities
Fast charging and Thunderbolt coming to pro next year those will be the new pro features D
lol I have a pixel but Im always zooming into 12x
Samsung can do portraits later for soo sooooo long 
We got USB C Now lets shoot for SD cards
Wow They could have just selling an USBC adapter Apple buyers are fkn debrained
Honestly  This is a dont care    Apple went through the motions on this keynote     See ya next year Lets see what they got to tempt my wallet then
Lame upgrade
"its not all the same but with new usb

Its all the same but with new usb"
My wife has been waiting to upgrade her 11 Well probably get a 15 next year when the 16 comes out and the price drops It will be nice to throw away all the lightning cables
In my world depth map on the photo is the biggest thing in this release
Just Apple to transform an USB port to a huge update
Really dont know I have the 13 pro really a toss up if I care about usb c that much to jump ship or wait it out another year
This release feels like they really dont know what to innovate anymore in a phone and basically feels like a money grab
Apple is doing well on iPhone new model softwares but I want to see some changes on the hardware side for me to upgrade
Practically every feature has been forced on apple by the EU
Is the 15 Pro light in weight my current 13 Pro Max is too heavy to hold in hand love the Pink
Nothing to say about the 60Hz display on the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus
pass 
I currently have a XR so I really need to get the new iPhone and Im going all in with it Hopefully its going to last me for another 5 years
was told phone is around 00067 ounces lighter  Might be misinformation  but IDK how this could feel lighter  Thats like the difference of a butterfly landing on your hand vs not
in the advertisement they said that you can record directly to an external hard drive seamlessly is this true
Im still using an 11 pro and now I dont know if I should get the 15 pro or wait until next year  But right now I think Ill wait until next years model comes out
I have drop my iPhone 13  14 before of the glass both never broke
This is why I wait so many years before upgrading So many small changes
Apple is smart they will make money from new type c accessories
I still have the iPhone 12Pro and I love it Its been a great phone and has never given me any problems Im obviously thinking about upgrading since its been a few years and the battery is not the same anymore but I honestly expected more features or a brand new design for the iPhone 15 I wonder if its worth it for me to make the switch now or wait another year and see what they come up with for the iPhone 16
Fast charging isnt something you should use constantly even if it was available batteries like gentle treatment
No fast charging  USB 2 transfer speeds  Max price for 5x zoom   Yawn 
over 4mill views in less than 12 hrs is insane
feature wise the USB C is probably better then lightning but noway the USB C port is a better design It sucks to clean that port and the middle part is more fragile then the whole lightning port
Nothing really knew
Im sticking with my iPhone 12 Pro just dont see why I should upgrade
Never been a fan of the pro max Definitely getting the pro in white it looks stunning
Basically 15 is trash  just bring back the mini
Dont care at all  
Ill just wait for the 16
I like that Tim Cook is slowly diversifying production AWAY from China  Mad respect to him for that  Its time to buy an iPhone made in India  Going forward IMO iPhone pro max is the best phone on the market
How long are people going to be willing to pay 800 for the same phone with features that should have been implemented years ago
Shooting directly to an external HD was the best news for the Pro Max I have an XR and ready to upgrade
At this point i think marques is getting paid by apple and hes not criticizing the fact that this is definitely not an upgrade since iphone 11
Lets not forgot Apple didnt add USBC as a feature because they wanted to make their phones better they added it because they wouldnt be allowed to sell their phone in Europe anymore Lets applaud the EU for this historic change not apple
I think you made a mistake its not aluminum but titanium rails
The cameras on the 15 Pro will also shoot 3D photos and video which nicely answers the Im not wearing a headset to my kids birthday party criticism of the Vision Pro
I have been using X all this while  so I am thinking about one of these 15s but not sure
If you had a 14 why on earth would you go to a 15 unless its just because you like new thing and have money to blow
Gonna upgrade from my 12 Pro Max Really like the design and looking forward to the new features that came to Pro models since Pro Motion Always On etc
Im coming from a XS Its time for me
Usb 20 in usbc port 
Next thing a collaboration between Apple and MKBHD on one of their items
I have a 12 pro I was so excited to upgrade before the 14 came out but ended up being underwhelmed This year is looking to be the same
I cant afford a iPhone 15 
 Now I know why the stock has dropped almost 10 in last 5 trading days
"But everythings MagSafe 
"
I bet you the iPhone will be rejecting other generic USB C cables
You payed buy apple 
Im passing I still have the 13 and its no difference other than a charger Not worth it
I will be stuck on Lightning till there is a new iPhone mini Full size iPhones are just too big for me to use comfortably Hopefully the 16 will have a mini or the SE will become the new Mini model
Would I like to have this new iPhone  Well sure I guess  My phone is a Redmi Note 11  Cost 200 euros plus a 22 VAT  Does it do everything the new iPhone do  Well yeah  lol  I can make phone calls  I can use all Google apps  The cameras are pretty good  Takes great pics  I am not a photographer  Just record moments  I read books on it  I watch videos Netflix etc  Look pretty good to me  So I can do anything with my cheap phone that one can do on the expensive iPhones  So why do people spend 4 times or more money for these phones  Well status of course  Very few people who buy them give a hoot about their advanced features  The same reason people buy expensive watches  It means you are cool  Peer pressure  I dont care about any of that  If i had the money would I buy one  Hmmmmm
Super nice presentation  Im an Android addict but I still liked it Keep up the good work 
Nope Happy with my 12 Pro
Was looking forward to your video got any more info on the ability to directly record on a hard drive with the pro models
Best update on the keynote  iCloud will get 6TB and 12TB options Finally
Its ironic cause Apple was on the original USB industry consortium so helped make usb in the first place
MK thanks for saying dont upgrade in so many words no fast charging no new design no stronger glass and the rest no one know what the hell apple is talking about USBc is the biggest thing apple is falling off
Apple shouting you out to prove a point was pure desperation lmao 
"The MAIN points are the charging port titanium different colors 

Everything else are small upgrades Anyway the new iphone 11 looks cool LMAO"
It really bother me how come a 799 dollar phone doesnt have 120 hz when a basic 200300 doller android have that
104 the W H A T
So with the new action button is there any glanceable information to know if youre on silent mode or not Currently I can just look for that orange line to know
Crazy to think the new portrait mode features are the result of a 2011 patent filing by Apple that got awarded in 2013 Also see Lytro
Im on an iPhone X so this year its my time to get a new one So Im team getting it
So their most talked feature usb C is just because they had to do it otherwise they couldnt sell in europe I mean cmon Apple no fast charging no reverse charging 5x optic zoom only on Max version 
I think Marques had to eat a lot not to mention the possibility of the Action button maybe being able to call Google Assistant
Thx M great reviewbiggest surprise is titanium for mua usb c is cool  too hmm 
I think apple is not thinking wisely 
why do you always endorse iphones bruh even when they are releasing same phones every year lol
I just need the price of the 14 pro max to get down enough for me to get one
The camera updates always make me want a  new phone each year though my SE2 seems to get me by just fine for now
Wait So that added expected features so late that its good now Lol
The iPhone releases get more embarrassing each year They went from having the leading edge in technology to now always playing catch up
Switched from iPhone to Nexus 5 now Pixel a few years back Aside from the opportunity to spend more money I dont think Ive missed much 
I just found out that Craigs speech in Europe to the European Union was a delayed marketing strategy for selling iPhone 15 for Convenience
Basically if you have an iPhone 6 or earlier this is a good upgrade
A17 Pro amazing chip held back by an OS thatll never fully utilize it We hear about all the under the hood AI magic now lets see the user facing software take advantage of it
Iphone 15 still at 60hz screen
2 minutes silence for lighting port RIP
"Strange how previousyear processors in the new iPhones nonpros are the new normal now 3 

Also thinking of upgrading my old Macbook Is M1 air still a good option or should I go for M2 air Not a heavy user"
1034 There is a very good reason for that 24 28 and 35mm are very common focal lengths that us photographers use So now instead of having to guess your focal length or take the time to set to 12x or 15x its there to quickly access Love it
Im in camp totally getting one Ive been using moment and other camera apps to squeeze the most camera control out of my 11 pro but its not matching my 2009 canon I also am a sucker for bit and features and am excited to get the iPhone 15 pro max
I was hoping that the 15 Pro Max would be a tantalising enough replacement for my 13 Pro Max but Im not really feeling the itch My 13 is going strong battery like brand new Telescoping lense  48Mp camera are sweet though
No fast charging wtf
"I love my macbook so I was considering getting an iphone but they just innovate so damn slowly Android just feels more exciting to stuck with Apple took literally years to get the same usbc we have all had for years Im still using my 5 year old Note 9 and it has fuckibg usbc lmao So how am I supposed to feel like Apple is the innovative company

Naw ima stick to Android"
Jesus Christ love you all 
Im waiting to get Xiaomi 12 5G snapdragon 4 gen 2 for 10 of iphone 15 pro max here in EuropeNone will buy iphone those days they have to reduce 70 of price
Dont care about iPhone  I came here just to see your review 
Im gonna be upgrading from the 10s max to the 14 pro max Going to be nice
Its just the hype that the iPhone creates there is nothing special about the iPhone 15 300usd Xiaomi android can do much more than this 
USBC does it make look cheaper tbh
You forgot to mention Apple didnt give people USBC out of their generosity but they were forced to do so by the EU after a long legal battle
Thanks Marques great overview of the most boring iPhone release in a long time I cant imagine why anyone with a 12 or newer would upgrade to the 15
Android users are just laughing 
Same shit every year in new colors
Totally will
Why didnt you tittle this video they settled when its the same exact phone as last year
RIPiss Lightning
its acc so amazing to see the goat tech reviewer do his thing not a shot to the others in space but the way marquees explains it idk man hard to explain but i guess thats how goats are almost indescribable
When compared to Steel Titanium has more capacity to deform and get back to its original form however it is more flexible Technically it has a lower young modulus
Looks like Marques broke YouTubeIve been trying to get his to come up for several minutes
insane 4500000 views in just about 11 hours
Those bands are like 2 titanium and 98 budget
might be finally time to upgrade from my XR sound about a good step
When will people finally just be done with Apples price gouging and scamming
I cant decide between blue or the natural color
Every time Apple dont put all available functions in a new phone to left something for next generation Its fg marketing All what you think you need to have in this generation will be at next
only losers pay for new iphone
I have the 14 pro max Im good
Maybe next 2 years iPhone base models will have usb c 30 lol
This comes off like a waste of money nothing new that stands out to me
WiFi 6E on the Pro is a big deal
Just the same damn phone 
Disappointed Apple
The new pro looks solid But the 5x lens is NOT an upgrade for me I would appreciate it if they added a 5x or 10x lens but to replace the 3x which is perfect for the portrait No just no They made it much easier for me to stick with the smaller pro this year
Black or white 
Pixel 8 pro will knock this phone out of the park
128GB Lmao
The new 3nm apple silicon chip is the main headline
Super here for a slightly more repairable iPhone I guess but Im going to keep getting refurbished old ones until we have a properly modular and fully repairable iPhone tech needs to stop having a shelf life I do love the apple OS but something like fairphone might be more up my alley
Year after year this is the best tech channel and the one i keep coming back Love it
They always hold back on tech so they can entice us to upgrade
iPhone 15 Plus in UK will be like 900 with usb 2 and 60 hz display
Need new engineer this is boring
no gold color is crazy to me
Thanks Which of these models do you think a business model Pro with gaming features and supercameras Or nonPro with lack of macrophoto and other performance features
Apple finally went from 2014 to 2015 in late 2023
You know how I know that the new iPhone is good Because the old one was good The new one is basically the old one just more expensive See whenever Apples iPhones price drops they have their guys altering it just a tiny bit so that they can charge you the original high price again paraphrasing on Gregory House here
Ill upgrade from the 13 pro max when they really do some real changes this is ridiculous apple running game and tricking you to get the same phone Im waiting for the 19
Congrats on the shoutout Marques I was scanning the internet yesterday for a new video from you about WWDC and Im sure millions of other people were as well Always refreshing to hear your takes on these things Thanks for the review as always cant wait to see whats next from you 
I actually dont even wanna upgrade from my 14 pro for once lol
Im currently in Samsung trying to decide do i switch but that USB not being thunderbolt hmmm
Even MKBHD is tired of apples bs 
Looks interesting but not enough for me to upgrade from my 14 Pro I have too many other products still on lightening cables
Eh Ill keep using my iPhone SE 1st gen XD
Marques you can ask David why 28mm and 35mm lenses are such a big deal
"Fast Charging is for the iPhone 16
USB C is the Convenience reason for people to buy iPhone 15"
Im in the camp My iPhone still works well enough that I dont need to upgrade but Im excited that when I do it will be to a USBC iPhone
I like how you completely glossed over the fact that the regular 15 iPhones are basically the iPhone pros from last year using last years chip 60hz refresh rate but you criticize the pixel 6A for having six year refresh rate and youre giving a pass to these iPhones you are completely hypocrite
Finally some better improvements
I wonder if Tim Cook will use this MKBHD Quote at the next Apple event  419  Basically its not bleeding edge stuff that weve never seen before Its just welcome stuff
soundcore
Longbeachgriffy already told us in his video what the iphone this year have
Really not a fan of the fact theyre all eSim only Ive had lots of cases when being able to swap my sim card from one phone to another while teleworking saved the day
I will get either the 15 pro or pro max I dislike the size of the pro max but better camera and battery life might convince me
Seems like tech is slowing down and spreading advancements throughout the releases Makes me wonder if the lack of fresh ideas and new discoveries are taking us to the brink of a tech collapse  
Im getting bored anyone else getting bored I miss the days when phones were experimental and interesting made me want to buy them all just to try them all
I just switched to iPhone have an iPad Glad I went with the 14pro max The 15 is not much better if at all
I feel like your conclusion contradicts your title a little Albeit that may be the point
Me and my iPhone 8 Plus have survived for 9 years maybe I should upgrade
For everyone out there is it worth upgrading from an IPhone 12 Pro Max to the 15 Pro Max I just dont see many benefits other than the USBC
Do we get any physical dual sim
Thx for your incredible work  Definitely considering to switch my SE 2020 with the 15 48 MP dynamic Island yeah
This accessory is not supported  when the poor folks try to charge with their old 2 USB cable 
how is it that everyone is overlooking the ability to shoot straight to external storage
The biggest thing is something thats been for years Sound pretty apple like
"Great vid as always A couple thoughts
How very Apple of them to upgrade to 2019 tech in 2023 Lack of fast charging also shows just how timid they are about hurting their precious little phones Finally future proofing a phone they want you to upgrade annually and at most semiannually is basically a moot point"
"Not having 120 HZ display on 15 made me postpone the purchase for another year

Im on 13 pro and only 120 HZ display is the feature I cant live without otherwise baseline 15 was just fine for me 

Indian pricing for 15 pro is insane and goes all the way to 2500 for 15 pro max 1 TB"
USB C is there in 150 phones lol for years It is hilarious how people turn blind eye to reality I am a fan of apple but a bigger fan of reality and iphone are shit this time However I am super excited about Apple watch I think they got a huge upgrade
Oh look another 1000 dollar plus phone that you cant repair
Still rocking a iPhone X so definitely gonna be updating this year now that I finally wont be able to get new software updates Just cant decide which one yet
USBC Bout time but not really
Great vid as always Still using my 11 and think it may be time to upgrade Will have to consider if the Pro is worth it just for the 120hz and slightly better camerausb speeds
"The product launch was about as a boring as a dull university lecture and even cringey with the data specs for USBC not a surprise its just disappointing and clearly gives apple a new point of difference next year for what makes the iPhone 16 more compelling faster USBC speeds 
Wooo pathetic Apple  Pro seems to mean now a way of making money off people who cant wait 1 year where in 1 years time iPhone regular is an old Pro minus 1 camera and some minor tech features"
Ok
Finally I can buy a iPhone now cause it has USBC
Although Ive never seen the iPhone 121314 before but I think the iPhone 15 series is very pretty 
I think the USBC thing about iPhones is just like the Single clutch transmission on the Lamborghini Aventador And now Apple and Lamborghini have fixed both problems on their latest models
What happened to the days of Apple innovating so glad I switched to the Galaxy fold after years of being iPhone loyal
im not too impressed bro
Hardware mute was one of the most amazing features of the iPhone As much as having it mappable is cool it loses one of the best features
Does the 15 Pro frame collect fingerprints
800 phone that has USB 20 in 2023 
Ive been an Apple fanboy since the first iPhone I waited in lines at stores overnight the whole nine I still have a 12 Pro Max Im no longer willing to give Apple 45mo for the rest of my life for barelyupgraded phones They hardly even qualify as incremental upgrades
just watchinghoping older models become cheapbut i dont think many will want to upgrade to this so soonat least not enough to drive the price down for older models
"This phone is honestly boring asf They need a massive design overhaul next year simply to keep the tech community from falling asleep at the conference Weve had this same overall design now since the 12

Also still no ProMotion on the regular 15 LOL"
Do somebody also got Samsung ad  on this video
Bro i just buy iPhone 14 last 2 week 
Marques if you can please talk about the LiDAR sensor on the pro devices in your review video It was supposedly an updated component according to some rumors but I would like to know because I wanna upgrade to a 15 pro for photogrammerty and other apps that rely on the lidar scanner
Wait so you have to press the side button every time you want to mute a call 
This guy is just too good Best tech reviewer on the planet 
 I remember using my android to charge my friends iPhone using usbc Thats nothing new
How about at always on display on the normal 15
Apple sneakly does this every year
"I like the Pro  Pro Max The upgrades feel substantial enough that I dont feel I can hate it too much 
The 15  15 Plus are ridiculous though I can not believe people see such a big enough value from iOS that they would sacrifice standard hardware you can find on cheaper Android phones 60Hz still USBC 20 Transfer Speeds No Telephoto Lens I get some people may not see a difference but would you pay 200  300 more compared to its competition just to have iOS on the latest hardware Personally iMessage isnt worth it at that point when I can use the number of chat apps that will circumvent it for free 
In my opinion they be better off only selling the Pro Models rebrand it and then sell lat year models for a 200 decrease"
USB C for iPhone  means iPhone people gonna be stealing  android  cables now 
have you heard anything on whether or not the sim tray will be deleted for more regions outside of the US
I guess if they stick with 128 gb 1100 phone they would have to bump down 4kRAW to 30 fps again
Nothing changed wow
So basically same shit slightly different toiletgreat job apple keep not innovating
when that burned sausage will go away from that beautiful screen its really ugly i will wait till its gone best alternatives available in the market for the time being i hope in another 3 4 years its will be gone or just a hole punch is fine fingers crossed
Nice Glad I skipped the 14 and waited for the 15 Nice upgrade over my 13 especially the cameras
Me watching this with my iPhone 7 Can a good Samaritan surprise a random person today
To draw a comparison to PVD anodizing is similar to permanent hair dye in that it penetrates the metal and changes its colour whereas PVD is more like a semipermanent hair dye that only coats the surface This means it could scratch away color if you dont get the raw Ti
Wish I could care Maybe next year will be a better upgrade Hoping they dont ditch wired charger sooner than later
The vedio content is there not a big difference between the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 15 the comments are WOW I definitely will buy the iPhone 15
the EU in Brussels is behind USBC he wanted that all the same connection
If you drop it on the glass youre still going to have not great results  Broken screen 
Wait so were using usb standard from year 2000 Are you fucking serious At this price Were using speeds from 23 years ago
So just stick to my iPhone 13 Pro Max thank you
So in a nut shell Apple havent changed much but the usual
"Im looking forward to the official statement from Apple regarding the falsified radiation measurements they gave us in France for the iPhone 12
Still going to buy the new 15 Pro Max tho"
whatever they do dont slow down my 13 pro max
Miles ahead android 
Apples technical incrementalism and lack of major innovation is concerning Theyll sell tons and make  but this flywheel of success will come to a grinding halt when The Next Big Thing is done by someone else
Apple is pretty much boring
Lets be real The majority of us is Android users wanting to hear you shit on Apple
The fact the usb c is a selling point for some is ironically stupid
The Mother Nature thing was cringe AF
All new iPads and other products will have USB C because of relegations in Europe
Thumbs up for catching the USB2 vs USB3 thing That made me raise an eyebrow during the presentation
Is the USBC waterproof 
I want to upgrade from a 12 just for the camera Many times I dont want to carry my mirrorless
should i upgrade from the XR
adam needs to stop
Is it just me or are people completely blind to the fact the new floating notch actually takes up more screen space than the old notch
  800
Aside from usbc it looks like the exact same crap as the last half dozen models
does it have vedeo backgroud blur 
I have the 14 pro max and I want the pink iPhone 
Nice 60herz and 20 usb in the basic one what a Joke
The settings to change the focal lens is kinda dumb ngl Is it that hard to press the lens you want when you open the camera up So weird lol
Apple has zero reason not to include the 5x lens in the regular Pro beyond trying to upsell consumers to the Max
Are you telling us you dont know the Huawei Mate 60 pro is out  
Same phone once again with slight upgrades that androids already had years ago
Im planning to upgrade to the 15 Pro from my 11 Im at the point now where I could use the better camera setup as Ive gotten a lot more into photography since buying my 11 I hate big phones though and as enticing as that 5x zoom is on the 15 Pro Max its not enough for me to buy it
nice review on the phone  it seems like there is only so much they can change   i wonder how the brighter screen will effect the battery life also with the bigger file size for the photos when will be get a larger onboard memory
TbhboringI want to see more innovation
I really dont care for this Im so disappointed the Apple Fold wasnt announced Im not upgrading until thats released
Vengo del tiktok donde lo exhiben por la cmara que trae 
Already have a 14 pro max 256 so Ill be upgrading
Same phone its been for the last decade Who cares
this USB port is due to EU initiative demanding apple to modify their phones to USB ports So good job EU
A lot of who cares but a couple potential big deals Would you please give a review of the 3D video with a moment focus on a barbers perspective or a wedding hair specialists perspective How much can this change our instagram Will the 3D be at all noticed when people are looking on their iPhones Any boost to our advertisements are important As you know
"Ive heard of these iPhones 
are they good asking for a friend"
303 48 MP chip
Bleeding edge tech stuff right there Slightly bigger holes on the phone Noice
They created a Bixby button on iPhone
So basically Apple is ripping us off the silly thing is is we all put phone cases over our investments so you never see the titanium or chrome band anyway apples
RAM
Usbc now Crazy 
i got the iphone 11 and 6 so definitely an upgrade and then retire the 6 super excited lol
Im in camp meh I might get it maybe
Costly
Didnt they mention this pro is much more repairable
Ive never purchased an iPhone nor have I used any  the iPhone 15 series still hasnt convinced me to purchase one I dont comprehend the hyperfixation with Apple products
Yeah nothing new enough for me to buy a new phone when old one still good
103 THE ONE PIECE
Does samsung do the same as apple putting the same chip as the previous gen pro in to the next gen base making them the literal same phone
"Just seems a waste of money really I switched to Asus rog and man its so good Fully charged in 30 minutes 

People always go on about how it looks and feel but you just end up putting a protector over it"
I am not getting any iPhone anytime soon I replace mine every four years
Imagine ppl who just got the 14 pro
Usb3  its 10 years old no 
"Features are just wow 
The price is a bit heavy but u can gift me one"
thanks EU for the USBC
Is anyone planning to make a MagSafe SSD now that the Pro models can record to external storage
Executive one still sentence summary its an iphone with improvements weighted towards the top tier models featuring functions wed expect from all of the competing model devices
It does seem a bit unusual to discontinue the 128GB Pro Max model However its possible that this decision aims to encourage individuals who are contemplating purchasing a larger phone to opt for the 15 Plus instead especially if they are hesitant to spend 1200 on a new phone 
It took heat from the EU to get apple to switch to usbc and now they will sell it to you as a brand new feature 
i have been using the iphone from i phone 6  lets be honset and pls stop saying the iphone 15 is wow there is nothing to wow about expect the type c that has been on androind from ages
thanks for the review will deffo get one
EU bodied apple rly hard
Does the cable still have proprietary limitations or other cables will work with these phones
I have an iPhone 7 Plus right now so yeah im getting one
I would get one but cant afford it plus my 13 is running just fine sure theres scratches on the screen but functionally its 100 fine
Finally Apple made an amazing innovation after years
Not to be one of those ppl but as normal phone user who sometimes plays games I dont see a reason to upgrade from my 13 Pro Max Im not a huge photo guy Ill take some pictures which this phone does well i also am the same person that went from iPhone 7X13PM theres just not enough of a performance bump for day to day use for me to upgrade i do need to upgrade everything else though Lol series 3 watch Gen 2 regular AirPods 17 MacBook Pro and not even sure which iPad I have its old though
Spoiler alert apple making no changes relevant as always
Rip mute button 
With all the hype meanwhile France will ban Iphone12 due to radiation levels Dont want that anywhere near my baby 
I think the switch from Stainless Steel to Titanium is quite underappreciated I have been longing for a Pro model thats the size of the Mini or somehow lighter than the SS models but slightly heavier than the Aluminum models It sounds to me like these models are going to hit that perfect spot for weight in the hands USBC is definitely a huge win for those who travel as well
Nothing interesting and itd require some new usb cableschargers I think this pushes me further to try an android phone next as I was already considering prior to this
From all the hemming and hawing in Youtube comments or on Reddit boards this should be the fastest and bestselling iPhone of all time Everyone non iPhone users wanted the iPhone to have USBC Now it does So I expect all those complainers to be lining the stores to get it If not why were they complaining Why did they care This is probably the most disappointed Ive been at an MKBHD video Even he subtly mentions it He always says his daily driver is an android and alludes to USBC Now its here and nothing
When companies were shifting their touch Id behind the phones  Apple was developing face id which no one is able to copy till date So when all the companies are giving ultra fast charging  Apple is developing a whole new battery Mark my words
Ill stick with my 13 Pro Max This phone seams nice but not a huge difference year to year now
The camera spacial mode I believe they caked it was the most interesting part of the phone
"Oh iPhone have USBC now Nice

laughs in android"
10 percent faster is nothing
Coming from a base iPhone 11 excited for the jump to the 15 Pro Max
So Nice for iphone 15 pro max
So absolutely nothing is new got it
Sounds like 15  15 is basically 14S to me
I kid you not I havent use the port in ages Magsafe duo only and airdrop Which I am BUMMED that magsafe duo is not coming out revamped
Lightning is super outdated
I watched this cause youre cool and I wanted to see what was up with the USBC without having to read anything I would much rather hear it from you cause you get all the relevant info Plus youre cool 
"I was pretty shocked to see that the 15 pro is the same price as last year and I really hope it stays that way through the 16 series as well I currently have a 13 pro and because of my contract cant upgrade until 2025 so I hope the 16 pro is just as exciting as this

Note I dont need a new phone and Im perfectly happy with this one but I enjoy the hype of a new release even if it only has minor improvements Its just fun to see what they add next Personal enjoyment I suppose but I like technology 

Also my phone is cheaper if I pay it off gradually hence the point of the contract"
my only regret buying the 14 instead of waiting out for 15 is that green color it looks absolutely amazing as for features i meanthe resolution bump is cool but for who will it make a difference lol
Keeping my iPhone 14 pro max
You should compare it to the s23 ultra
Flip or 15 
prob usb 3 for next year and the pros will get thunderbolt
Does the cable still have proprietary limitations or the other cables will work with these phones
It is not a big deal for that USBC Honestly it might be a bad thing when it comes to chargers and a variety of cables by this I mean that most people will misunderstand and keep using their crazy 65W watts charger and it will drastically decrease its battery life I am now on iPhone 14 Pro Max and do not plan on switching to the new iPhone 15 Pro Max do not find much difference compared to previous one
"they should bring the headphone jack back because it really helps in high quality low latency earphones for gaming and wired uses less battery and they are doing too many mistakes by not giving  fast charging  so it means people cant do gaming and video recording or screen recording for too long in continuous successions  fast charging is so underrated  tis ok if they dont give 60 watt but at least 45 watt fast charging is needed
FM radio should be brought back as its so underrated and old school people use it "
601 you just spoiled next years update
new action button So innovative every other Android manufacturer laughs i do like the back glass stuff
I love the video but like always its difficult to be excited for a New IPhone when not much changes I miss the days of innovation and creativity at these events and the excitement of what will happen because they made a name for themselves as being the creatives to follow
I will never understand why anyone buys Apple products anymore They are so far behind designwise and still is so restrictive compared to Android
Im not surprised that apple made minimal changes because they know they dont have a serious competitor for its iphone 
new iphonezzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Ordering 15 Pro Max on Friday
I guess i will have to wait for iPhone 17
Im keeping my 13 pro max for now
Totally getting the 15 pro max
The reason why the USBC port is limited because that gives them headroom to unlock new features with it for the next 23 years  Stupid but thats why imo
Been having issues and havent quite nailed down whether its TMo or Android or both but Im about ready to lose my mind and go back to the dark side
I have a 12 Pro Max and I dont see a point in upgrading even though I can upgrade fairly cheaply via trade in
Classic Apple gatekeeping
Lame as usual  Must be nice to be on Apples payroll
I feel like the only reason that everyone isnt saying that roadside assistance via satellite is the biggest feature is that cars are pretty reliable now Decades ago people wouldve gone nuts for that My car is unreliable so it seems pretty cool to me
i ll never buy it
So basically nothing new that weve never seen in other phones Nit a single revolutionary feature
I have 13 pro and will skip upgrade  at this time Probably Iphone 16pro
I havent bought a new phone in 3 years should i buy the pro max i have a samsung now
Im really debating changing from my Samsung Galaxy S23 ultra I love the look of iphone but love what my Samsung can do Dont know what to do Really want the 15 pro max
I still have my 12 Pro Max so these upgrades are worth it for me
Im pretty hype about these new phones I cant afford right now lol
woooooooooooow the same phone as the 14
Disappointed Apple Lacks Innovation Depressing Colors
This Ill get to that in a bit is infuriating and disrespectful to your audience
That was crazy that Tim brought your name up and  a quote from you You are a change maker for all YouTubers
i have the iphone 11 since its came out  would definately grab an iphone 15 pro looks so good but mine can give another 23 years So i guess i will wait until i have a budget  while the price of 15 drops too
I thought by far the most impacting for the future was that it is able to take 3D pictures
Ho hum
So basically this new iPhone 15 phone is technically the iPhone 14  2 because its recycled most likely Ill just stick to Samsung because overall but they got the new tech the new foldable 5 phone which is good so Im going to stick with that this year 
USBC is good of course the interesting part was the raw video directly into an external SSD
We could all be using iPhone 10s right now and no one would be missing out on anything that these new phones do because they still do they same stuff
USBc is the big headline Really   Disappointed after seeing so many exciting predictions from so called insiders  end up a big fail Will be going from 12PM to 15PM but really I was surprised there werent more significant upgrades from last years 14PM
Yo Fyi Anker got some crazy deals on amazon today
Did everyone forget about product red Im low key way bummed theres not a product red iPhone 15 
Conclusion  No big upgraded
Samsung S23 Ultra FTW 
If they would add a 3 button navigation option like Android has and some goddamn bezels so you get an uninterrupted screen then it might be worth buying
This things a joke
Can I get a an Iphone 15 from you
imagine your new phone being so uneventfull that the biggest thing about it its a port thats been arround for almost 10 years
IPhones are not worth it
This is so disappointing to me These last 56 iPhones have not been worth buying I remember being younger and watching Steve Jobs do the keynote and being excited for the iPhone Then going to ATT and waiting in a line over night to get it I got to meet so many different people from all walks of life not to mention the businessmen that I still do business with today The iPhone used to be more than just a phone Nowits just a phone  android is looking real good right now 
Im in campDont care at all  Ill keep the 14 and wait for the 16
Comparing to other phones the iPhone 15 have nothing new to add honestly I think its behind a lot of phones Apple company they dont bother them selves to give their consumers innovative design cause they know that they will buy it not cause its good or bring new stuff but just for the brand name
4 milly in 10 hours  MKBHD  Legendary YT 
Dude 11 hours and 41 Million views hahaha You are destroying Good on you Clear concise intelligent reviews are NECESSARY Thank you Marques
The Pro finally seems like it is more of an upgrade than just an extra lense and some exclusive software features Really a bummer about the port speed staying at early USB levels Thats a huge missed mark
Ive had the xs max since it came out and ive been waiting for apple to realease a usbc phone before upgrading So im getting the 15 pro max but its honestly not that much of a difference from the last 2 iterations
Apple cant do all at once Since there is no longer any innovation they have to keep things in the back pocket for next years features
Watching from a 14k INR  phone
Isnt the 15 very much a 14 pro without the 120hz screen
They put USB 20 on the non pro models to keep people paying for iCloud
Im writing this comment on an iPhone 11 I wait every year for a massive update and tell myself okay this year Ill replace it and get the new one The island was a big update and people around me always get the new phones but every year I find myself realizing that I can accomplish 9995 of the same things on this old 11 that one can on the new ones Im still waiting on an infinity screenMaybe next year
About time they changed to usb c  Than u to the eu regulations
Action Button feels like Samsung 2015
is normal 15 120hz
704 one thing I cant find anyone talk about it is this connector or whatever it is under the side button on the right side
im asking myself if the gpu is so strong why its not possible to hook up the phone to a screen connect a keyboard and mouse or controller via bluetooth and make a light pc or gaming console out of it
I really love my mini 13 I just wish they also had a mini 15 as I wouldve switched immediately
now they will earn money from usb type c cable and new adapters its their scheme of selling new accessories and make more profit
Tempted more than ever to finally try the iphone 15 pro after having androids since the birth of smartphones Ive had quite the buggy experience with the pixel 6 pro the past 2 years and its left me annoyed way too many times Especially with the latest glitches of the screen sometimes just stops working The worst time it happens is when Im getting a call so I cannot answer or even see who is calling I have to hit the power button then unlock the phone again to get it working
so they dropped the iphone mini for a big iphone and a big ass iphone when the iphone mini could be the iphone and the iphone could be the iphone plus
By volume titanium is WEAKER than steel By mass its stronger  but you need a larger volume of metal and Apple seems to have gone with a SMALLER volume of metal with the new iPhone So I would expect it to actually be weaker than the iPhone 14 Pro But  as you said the real issue is and always has been the glass not the frame
Great another cable that wont come in the box and I have to buy because the old lighting wont work 
Not upgrading I got IPhone 14 pro max iPhone is starting to get stale for me They need to update there iPhone or the OS I would say OS still waiting for them to split the screen so you can actually do two things at once
Basically Apple made a 2018 phone
It does blow my mind the amount of people that seem to believe Apple are forcing them to buy a new phone Like if you have a 14 13 or 12 dont upgrade your phone is still great 
Im in camp I got a 13 Pro so no need to upgrade to a new iPhone for another year or so
Ill stick to my 13pro for another couple of years
Glass usually breaks when a corner dents hence titanium
Real talk How did that dude at 1006 get to basically carry the GFX 100 II with them to an Apple event
Can you set the action button to do one thing on long press and something else on short press As an example muteunmute on long press and open camera on short press
You totally ran with that demo phone havent you Tyrone
I just really hope the cameras function better ever since they began to leave it up to AI to try to pick the best lens for you etc Ive had mixed results since that change
Its dumb they release a phone every year
Thank you MKBHD for pointing out that iPhone 15 only has 60hz refresh rate
Im totally getting one Im upgrading from the 12 Pro Max The only think that I dont like are the colors the titanium one is awful and I really loved the deep purple color we had last year
Just another day and still the same old mouse
I love my iPhone 14 pro The max is a little to big for my hand Im a big cmara guy and was looking forward to upgrade for in the past both models had the same cmara Now they went back to have differences between both models SAD SAD SAD I wont upgrade anymore Sorry Apple
The most exciting thing from the presentation was seeing Tim Cook quote you
wow USBC cutting edge stuff maybe Samsung will someday catch up
Is it possible to run a shortcut triggered by the action button with the phone being locked i e display off
Nothing about the ridiculous 60hz refresh rate unbelievable sponsored apple channel no doubt about it
What a failure launch
Anybody knows if the USBC connection on the Pro models can be used for an external monitor
"Its a grift ppl keep your 
If you want innovation then S23S24 Ultra Pixel 8 Pro or be daring and grab the Huawei Mate60Pro for innovation"
same crap which people love to buy  again
Mobile phone reviewers on YouTube are simply iPhone users that review android phones for a living
planning to get the 15 pro coming from a 12 pro so i think this is gonna be a significant improvement for myself also i get the pro models are meant to look professionalsleek but i really wish the pro models had more brighter colors
laughs in 120W charging
Im pretty sure Apple has data on how many iPhone users have plugged their iPhone into a computer Out of nonPro phone users my guess is that number is nearly zero percent
Imagine if Samsung did a release like this lol
301 48mp chip 
The features of Huawei Mate 60 Pro seem far more interesting
Apple give type c in 2023  Android 1  apple 0 
So just USBC Cool
Please launch google as a shortcut
Apple Doing The Greater Fool Effect well theyll keep selling same design with literally No changes and people will keep buying until no greater fool is left to buy
They have to save fast charging for another year lol Im sure that will be the headline feature then 
I have a 14 pro and although the 15 pro will be faster maybe better camera software etc Im likely to keep the 14 pro and buy a dslr
ok since when did you fly first class
will the iPhone 15 plus have the 120Hz display Or do you have to go up to the 15 pro max for it
Apple has low key given up on innovation on the iphone
There are a lot of applications that will use your default camera to scan documents etc but the iPhone 14 Pro Max will use the lens that doesnt have close focus and you run into issues with that so I am glad you can change the default lens
Remember if you are European  the pricingchanges Marques talks about dont apply to you They dropped all their  prices
Why is there a photo of a Juicebitz 30 pin connector lol
340 I wonder if that feature also works for selfie photos as well with the front facing camera
I wonder when theyre going to put a stylus in their phones
What a joke Steve would be so disappointed in the lack of innovation at his company
Dont care at all these last few years for iPhone are like incremental AF its like give us a legitimate reason to upgrade
I think you skipped the most interesting part The video games they showed were not just some random mobile games theyre console quality games including Resident Evil 4 and Death Stranding
They are keeping Fast Charging for the next years model gotta keep new stuff for the next model
It just happens to be my upgrade time w my carrier so Ill b upgrading from the 12 pro maxFor me it will be a bit of a leap and Im excitedKinda cool they quoted you in the eventCongrats to you and your team on all of your successYour podcast has quickly become my favorite
This feels like an iPhone 14s the iPhone 16 is going to be more innovative
"I still have the 13 Pro but I think thats ok because if this is all they have done then next year or the year after might actually be a big upgrade for what the iPhone can do Also wonder what USBC means now for audio features like Apple Music Loseless how Dongle Dacs work and what is supported 

My main use for the iPhone is Apple Music so this matters more to me then a camera upgrade"
MKBHD dont forget the portrait mode thing was available 10 years ago with the Lumia 1020 you could take a picture and choose your focal point in processing
I came from an android when I got my iPhone 11 a couple years ago I missed my USB C and one cable for everything I also missed my action button on the back of my Pixel 2 which I would use to bring up the voice assistant Really curious about the 15 pro now 
Im sure Apple will spin on the USBC for a couple of years Next year Apple will hypeup some new feature  that has actually been available for years
Probably buying this gen but more because hearing aides work best on bluetooth 52 which the 12 doesnt have and they added with the 14
Im debating upgrading I currently have the SE 2nd gen and its working just fine Once they stop doing iOS updates for my phone then Ill upgrade
Hey MKBHD we need a video on the recent iPhone 12 banrecal in France which could be extended all over Europe Thats a big deal
Since I MAY get a Vision Pro using my iPhone Upgrade Program to keep the same monthly cost and get Spatial Camera is worth it
Anyone noticed Marquis brownlee was in the keynote well done bro
I think Apple got lazy The 15 Pro has no real advantages to the last generations and at least the persocope camera had to find a way in the normal size pro models So many people are annoyed that apple puts no effort in the usual pro models and the upgrade cycles are getting longer every generation
Im not an apple fanboy but one thing they are great at is that they know how to fool their fan base 
Wish we got a substantial camera upgrade like a 10x or 15x Now that would be worth it for me 3  5 ehhh I take many photos but thats not enough
My XS Max is still solid but with 64GB storage it is hard to carry around
Your life wont change if you dont buy I Phone 15
Ppl complain to much its simple if you dont like it just dont say anything and dont buy it move on yall need to grow up
looking at the specs of the 15Pro camera shown in the presentation the sensor is actually not bigger  as you say in 1012 than the 14 Pro What they appear to have done is give the 15 a new smaller 48mp sensor as indicated by smaller pixel dimensions And the 15 pro has the same sensor as the 14 pro
My apple iPad 2018 had usb c
Interesting but Ill be waiting for an iPhone fold
Will we be able to plug in our Type C accessories to the base model iPhone 15 like portable SSDs
I still have a iPhone 13 Pro Max I dont think that theses small incremental changes makes me want to spend the extra money for a new iPhone I rather wait for a full redesign for me to want to switch to a new 119900 dollar iPhone
The last iPhone I bought was an iPhone 12 and will never go back
iPhones having USB C feels like the right thing to do even though Apple was forced into doing it because its not in their DNA to do the right thing for consumers  I wonder if theyll limit the speeds of USB C cables unless theyre made for iPhones Now they just need to fix that craptastic software and I might give iphones another try
Pro max titanium is what I booking Upgrade from 13
"60hz on the base iPhone 15 models is criminal by Apple 

Kind of sucks that if I do upgrade to the 15 Pro from iPhone 12 Ill have to still charge my AirPod pros 1 with the lightning cable"
153 cheap ipad I mean it is definitely less expensive than the rest of the ipads however it is still expensive for some people 
Innovation died with Steve Theyre releasing basically the same phone every year
Whens Pixel 8
Im keeping my 14 pro max
I have iPhone 12 pro and was eagerly waiting for iPhone 15 unfortunately there is NOTHING that make me want to spend 10001300 Apple gotta scale up a bit Thats definitely a bummer
all new for 2023 Type C on iphone huh Android base phones have had type C since 2015 lol with some android phone having 200W charging speeds
"I truly dislike even despise small format USB connections 

Over the years the smaller USB iterations have no lasting longevity as Ive lost count on the multitude of Mini USB Micro USB and yes even USB C connections that have eventually become faulty even the USB C socket on a previous Nintendo Switch eventually went faulty 

Yet Ive only ever had one Lightening connector socket which eventually became faulty 

Small formfactor USB connection sockets are doomed with having an extremely thin protruding middle pcb style tonguespade with connection contacts and the spade and contacts gets worn and sometimes buckled over time The pinscontacts in the mini USB micro USB and USB C sockets can become buckled bent and warped over time like a set of knackered teeth thats been bashed to oblivion from a boxers knockout blow

Yet the Lightning connector socket has no middle pcb tongue protruding out within the lightening socket to become easily damaged and this is because the lightening connector end on the cable itself is effectively the inner spade that makes contact with the socket and the difference here is that its substantially thicker stronger and an incredibly robust spadetongue type connector Thus it lasts very long 

Apple should have stood its ground with it despite the EUs threats over it

Now I have the problem that if I upgrade my iPhone which is long overdue Im going to have to contend with a connection format that has nowhere near the robustness and longevity of the Lightening connection"
"Count me in on the percentage of people waiting for MKBHDs full review If its not MKBHD I dont know who else 

Anyway I am confused as to why people is saying that iPhone still dont have fast charging man my iPhone 12 is blazing fast when charging I think 1hr of charging and its done using a 20watt charger Unlike when I still have my 6s Plus it takes more than 2 hrs of charging

If there is one thing that I hoped Apple would include on the regular 15 model it will be 120hz or even just 90hz screen refresh rate They said they used recycled materials on some part of the iPhone 15 shouldnt they used what they have saved on their total costs on putting a much higher refresh rates I just think every Apple user deserves that atleast"
No coloured cables Im guessing
Is the new USB C is a reaction to the EU Competition regulator
that action button is cool everyone says thatbut no one says its very dificult to reach there by one handif apple place it somewhere in the middle of the frame then it would be more accessible then 
I think Im kinda done with the iPhone for now I have no problems really but its time for a change and im looking forward to the new Pixel Pro coming out soon Every new iPhone model is pretty much the same as the last i like the idea of the 3d camera but not enough that id be willing to buy extra kit to watch it back
The iPhone 15 the best android phone money can buy
Should I upgrade from a 13pro
I bet if Huawei was still in the business  I mean using Google app store  Apple could have had a serious problem  Apple is not innovative
Man the s24 ultra has to do a lot next year this a17 pro is insane I would get an iphone 15 pro but I simply cant stand iOs
Nothing really innovative here with the new phone I have a 14 pro max and I have a family member who works at Apple So trade in credit and family discount I can get one for 359 and Im still struggling deciding if I get one
What features android leave it on its own for it customers to explore  apple makes ads and does a whole lot of marketing for those readily available features
idk i have a 13 pro and im not seeing a reason to upgrade unless i can get a great deal on a trade in ill prob pass and theres no nice colors on the pro all so bland and boring
isnt the action button like the back tap
Only 10 gains in this generation soon we will see geekbench scores crushing Snapdragon gen 3 with over 3040 higher scores geekbench is rubish
Congrats on the Apple mention
Congrats to Apple theyre so bold with their innovation nowadays
Apple quoting mkbhd is not in my bingo card mind blown 
I need an action button like what Gopro cams have 1 touch recording
CAMERA BUTTON LETS GOOOOOO
This is just sad
most awaited video
I cant wait for your reviews to take a decision
956 Samsung can do that with Good Lock
That portrait mode update has been on Samsung phones for at least 3 generations What else is new
Yall think its worth it to upgrade from Iphone 11 to 15 
Prob not enough for me to upgrade from the 14 Pro Max
its starting to look like a android and not separate iconic phone they probably lose sells apart from people who buy anything apple makes regardless if it looks like a boring android
No fast charging Im out
Even I bought a new iPhone 15 I still need to bring a lighting cable since the AirPod is needed
This man is pretty much sold to APPLE he just doesnt complain in a very imperfect phone
How about brand new tech like the double press customizable function of the power button on the Samsung S8 Been opening my camera fast since 2018
Interested in the iPhone 15  Dont need all the bells and whistles  Thanks for the update
USBC is a big idea cos I hate carrying so many different cables
Been watching your videos for years  I keep coming back because you dont sugar coat the truth while at the same time you dont shit on the quality of the phone  It is Apple were talking about
Hauwei is lightyears ahead of iPhone
So why would you get an iPhone 15 when you can get a 14 pro for less with partly even better features
My sentiments exactly 
Im really trying to figure out why dont the Pros have more colors and why is the 15 pro the same size as the 15 but has 3 cameras
Two years ago I upgraded from the 8 Plus to the 13 Pro Max clearly an upgrade  Four months later my 13 was stolen and I bought a used 11 Pro Max as a filler  Frankly the difference was insignificant  When it was released the 14 Pro Max wasnt a real step forward so I skipped it  Is this a worthwhile upgrade or just another nonevent  For me its all about the cameras  I look forward to full review of those
Only question I am asking myself is  is it worth to upgrade from iPhone 13 to 15 pro I do not live in US so if I buy a phone from US its going to be difficult becuase US does not sell iPhones with sim tray I travel to different countries Sim tray helps switching sims but esim makes it difficult Buying iPhones outside of US is not worth it because its usually 200300 USD more
Wow three ways to trigger the camera on the Lock Screen  wtf
825 Because of the EU
MKBHD desperately trying to find something good in the new phone but sadly there is nothing remarkable in the new phone
That big black hole notch in the middle of the screen is still the ugliest thing I have ever seen I refuse to get a new iPhone until its gone
Apple needs to make a USB type A to C so I can still use my wired AppleCar play
NPC alert at 1106
"Just take my money  or my kidney 
My last Apple was Ipod nano 2005 so do i need to upgrade LoL"
coming from an iPhone X this is the first time Im convinced I have to switch phone
"How the hell do they justify slightly updated for so much money to only get slightly updated

If you buy a pro you can only ever continue buying a pro because the pro features from the last gen go into the normal phone for the next gen

Its such a shame I wish they really pushed the envelope on features otherwise its nearly pointless to buy a new one every year"
Shouldnt the newer I phones with USB type C be shipped with charger in the box since the Apple community does not have Type C charger lying around their homes Since this was the reason behind removing the lighting chargers in the first place
750 lol Ive had my S23 fly off an escooter holder and still be fine
Not upgrading until island is gone and everything is behind display
Ive been waiting for 3 years for iPhone to change models so I can upgrade I dont want to wait another year 
20w F Apple
Those base iphone colors are way to girly no offense
Thread radio has never been seen in another smartphone
Hestruggling to sell IPhone 15 a hard sell device with limited to no Wow factor
USB 20 speed on USB type C is just so dumb
"Im with you I was really hoping for thunderbolt speeds on the pro models but the higher bus is welcomed 
Ill upgrade from iphone 0 to 15 pro max"
"I have a 14 pro max so clearly this makes no sense Yet  the ar movie feature may get me Ie assuming it does not explode I shall be getting the vr headset Is everything self contained in the headset or will a faster phone matter If it matters and I am going to be getting the phone in January might as well get it now

I live in Nevada so being able to call AAA without needing a cell tower is a comforting security blanket"
USB C 20 and 30 they need something to save for base iPhone 16
When we get sheets of titanium at work they always write grade 2 tit or grade 5 tit on it  they think theyre funny
What I want to know but no review seems to confirm does the iPhone work with 3rd party USB C cables or does it have to be MFi cables
650 next yrs feature Welcome to Apples game
Hardest pass ever
Seems theyve upgraded previous model phones so vast that theyve run out of ideas to properly upgrade the phones theyre making now These phones arent worth the asking price and the changes arent either 
Still waiting on Touch ID under the display before i get another iPhone Type C is definitely a step in the right direction for me
So I dont think the biggest feature was the USBC but the chip changes The hardware Ray Tracing and apples equivalent to DLSS is a pretty big change to shove into a phone imo
The only thing I was hoping for was a smaller Apple Watch ultra 
Theyll implement 40W chargingon iPhone 16 Maybe
Apple give you everything you said you wanted but its still not enough I like how you glossed over it being a next gen console and ur favorite feature was a button ok Stop saying the PRO models only they always did this of course the pro gets the Better features dummy just like every product from every company in history
so it is just usb c with some minor tweaks
This is the iphone S year 
Im just gonna leave a comment here incase future me comes back to see this video again
please review mate 60 
Was hoping the pro would have 10x optical zoom  disappointed with the 5x optical zoom
man steve jobs would hate how utterly noninnovative apple has become 9999 of ppl couldnt tell the difference between iphone 13 and iphone 15
I thought they givr some competition to the galaxy
No fast charging  My 14 has it  It can charge from zero to 80  in about 25  minutes
Im in camp Wish I Could Make As Much Money As Apple Assumes I Do
So the eu won
Actually the most disappointing part is no black watch ultra
Hell yeah I am definitely upgrading to the 15 Pro Max Im coming from the 12 so its a nice big leap for me I guess if you upgrade every year you dont really notice a huge difference But thats what I love steady marginal improvements over time are great
Thanks Maques Apple  lameYou guys are not on the forefront anymore
Dont lie its pretty much just usbc
Ill wait until next year to upgrade 
Spatial video already is a big deal
Apple only made the USBC change because they were legally required to by the European Union
Imagine the headlining new feature of a new 1000 phone being type c i might have to switch to android
Im good with my 14
Some parts of this video had me double checking that the video playback was actually on normal speed 
Before buying a new phone ask yourself this question  Will this new phone bring in more money for me if not dont buy it
So the new action switch is sorta the same as the Taptic double tap feature I normally use for shortcuts 
going to buy this new phone since im still on the 11 lol
USB 31 Gen 2 I believe
Another fanboy review
I currently own the IPhone SE 2nd generation when it first came out This phone is getting pretty old now so Im planning on getting the 15
I need that Dodge shirt do you have on
Camp dontcareatall
"As a Apple fan since Steve Jobs time  I must say I am no longer excited about the new iPhone  they just feel the same  so boring 

Its like a old computer  just changing the cpu  no longer we can anticipate anything new and exciting since the first iPhone 

My favorite was iPhone 4

You testing the new Huawei phone   The functions and specs sounds pretty cool

I thinking to switch once my mini no longer charge properly"
Funny cause you would think USBC would be amazing but in my car at work and at home I only use MagSafe  so means nothing to me
Did you not tell us that only this phone and maybe the next one will have USBC and eventually the charge port will be removed so wireless charging only 
"Thanks Apple for reminding me my Samsung handset has a Bixby button I can rebind

Jokes aside the thing you pay for with Apple is incorporation of functionality at an operating system level which enables a lot of the same features you could find on other handsets in a way that is way less janky and far more intuitive

Its still not worth the money Root an Android handset enjoy life securely work with the jank and stand against corporate interests like this that would be morethanwilling to pay the workers who build these things far less than they deserve"
fast charging and thunderbolt coming next genprobably they gonna name it Magic Port
A new port and a button End of summary
So basically they just replaced a switch with a button and changed the charging port
USBC ew
my opinion is that last years 14 pro models were better than 15 pro models but this years standard 15 is a way better standard model than any of previous ones cz theyfinally changed something thats big like the back
Tell me just One reason to upgrade from 14 pro to 15 pro A brand new chip  respectively I feel you are a Apple seller cuz you said 100 times its changed thats changed big changed   what changed Nothing
Ill probably upgrade my 14 Pro Max to the 15 Pro Max
L sponsor Sucks that you would take money from a trashy company
Been waiting for this video for a while Paid off my 12pro max last year and have been waiting to upgrade While the big changes are minimal since last year skipping a couple generations makes this a no brainer buy for me
"Only took Apple 8 years to finally care about the rest of the world with this TypeC charger
I see Apple is proving why theyre a trillion dollar company Selling your phone with only the Pro version having a better chip for faster TypeC
I will stick with my 400 Rugged phone that comes with Night Vision and Flir It wont break from a 6 foot drop As well as a nice 20000 mAh battery 
Oh my 400 phone also comes with two custom buttons on the side  Oh Apple"
Mkbhd take money from apple this review just a fake dont believe
Finally the terms Samsung charger and iPhone charger are dead
I will come back here if I could get one and that will be my first Apple gadget 
"Title Not just USBC
Video Just USBC"
MKBHD is an Apple friend USB 20 on iPhone 15 The 20 released 23 years ago Cables inside the box are 20 even for the Pro Hahahahahahaha
"I am your average consumer  
Heres what I heard

Theres nothing new except a charging port  
The charging port adds no additional features and youll have to replace all of your old charging cables Again 

Also our only competitor android is still completely incompatible with texting or calling anyone that owns an iPhone  
Which is everyone  

At least they now offer the colors black blue white and Other white"
I want a flip
"The sale should have been with the 15pro with Pro Max features 

May be next year  this iPhone its for the EU"
That USB c makes me laugh  
Only 480Mbps on the iPhone 15
Future proofing Majority of people are buying these for status and by next year they would have thrown this phone into recycling  No one is buying these gadgets for future proofing  
This is getting lazy apple why isnt this like th iPhone 14s
Love the photoshopped hand on the thumbnail
So disappointed from iphone 15 not gonna buy it btw thanks MK for the review
CORNY THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF IDEAS small this small that pathetic these features have been available for the past 35 years
Lol fast chargingthey need to say the invented something new for the iPhone 16
Apple definitely transitioning from the usual Apple isolation where if you use apple before you cant use other peoples phone accessories like the charger headset etc whereas now apple wants to Join the group hahaha
The last straw is official sideload support which I can install external app I can install revanced stuff and I will finally consider 512GB iphone plus
The WHAT  104
Definitely waiting for the review your review Should be curious to know how the swap from stainless steel to titanium works on a daytoday basis for you The other features I can totally live without The weight reduction was for me the most interesting part of the keynote yesterday  Gosh that says something
"Its not the stainless steel that breaks its the glass that breaks
                                                           MKBHD"
Cool but here is a thought you spent 999USD on a phone that is basically the same as it was in the last 45 years But now you spent that money to insert a 3 cable
Currently Im in iPhone 14 pro max and should I upgrade to 15 pro max or not What is your recommendation
Basically they just changed the name and added a usb c and a titanium body so thats the iPhone 15
Should I upgrade w my iPhone 11 this year or still wait 
So Much New Stuff Wow
"Apple is taking a play out of Samsungs playbook Gotta pay 1200 for the big flagship  
I
Dont
Like
This
Trend"
So today  
iPhone 15 is literally inferior than Samsung Galaxy 23
I have been  team pixel since they first came out Ive decided to finally switch to iPhone this year Nervous but cant wait for change
Fast charging is going to be iPhone 16 pro next year 
I really like your reviews to be honest I dont understand the need for the action button at least make it orange but they completely removed the identity of that section it felt kind of like a Twitter move 
Wow  type C 
No fast charging is crazy 
Great video I really enjoyed watching this You never disappoint Another things is that I think that there hasnt been a very significant upgrade from the previous iphone Well one thing you can always count on apple upgrading is the price  but honestly this time apple surprised me by not making really that big of a difference in price I wouldnt get it if I had the 14 but if I needed a new phone I would definitely get this
Nowadays its only an idiot will be stupid enough to buy a newer and more expensive product which is minimally better than its predecessor version
Please gift  for me iphone dear brother 
"A lot of people dont realize that USBC doesnt have any electrical requirements attached to it It is purely a physical connector standard and only refers to the shape of the connector Some technical capabilities require the use of the USBC connector but simply having C doesnt require implementation of any of those features

USBA the rectangular connector we know and love
USBB the various connectors mostly used on the peripheral side miniB MicroB are smaller variants
USBC the reversible connector"
LOL OMF Apple shows raytracing ability of its PPPHHOOONE Meanwhile game devs dont bother to code for Apples chip  OS LOLOLOLOL The game industry is so broken or totally corrupt to MS
In the UK the prices have been reduced
I think the reason behind calling the new chip pro is that from next year each phone will have their own CPU rather than standard models getting previous year pro CPUs
Those who Cant afford like me
Thank the Europe for usb c
I was waiting for this event so that I could decide whether to go with 15 pro or S23 Ultra
Imagine then these same companies will go and lobby the government to be sanctioning other companies which are actually trying to innovate and bring products that the industry is actually excited about
These are laughable upgrades to an android user but Ive been waiting on this for 3 years so I will shamelessly get 1
Apple needs to next put their brains into Lighter  Thinner products   Watch is too thick iPadsPhones too heavy etc    Its time
Kinda wierd they decided to bump the prices for such a boring new pro model
Lighter by few grams 
This is really boring I am disappointed by this longwinded review that isnt saying more than the actual event itself
Google Assistant is going on that action button stat
Most of the new stuff on have been on Android phone for years USB port action button tela photo lens  other anew chip set and brighter screen is worth updating from 14 to  a 15 
This guy is trying hard explaining its feature Ivan understands the pressure n the money
the seals on the planes engine was fucked 
When they selling the pro max
Without any doubt I would sacrifice the wireless charging just to have a titanium back panel that would be really cool
So its just samsung s22
Do you have an iPhone usbc cable
So basically theres no point upgrading from a 14 Pro
Andddd I think its about time to give a z fold a spin feel like Ive bought the same iPhone every year for the past 5 years 
Same shit 
Nope still with my 13 pro Waiting for the 18 pro
this phone records to external storage huge feature
I am personally not going to buy iPhone 15 just for a USBC
Mkbhd review is a proof that how much time he said word same same same ha ha
I already bought my S21FE Ill buy an iPhone 19 or 20 maybe
Overall the iPhone 15 is not a major upgrade over the iPhone 14 It has some minor improvements but nothing that is likely to make people rush out to buy it If you are happy with your current iPhone there is no need to upgrade to the iPhone 15
Samsung
I wish they would bring back the mini 
I see apple is still pushing their upg4ades sl9w to milk the market
Apple is getting usles brand with no feature 
Im in camp resurrect the mini
Wow how did I watch this whole video without any ads
Tbh usbc would be amazing to have but as long as i still have several airpods i might as well stick to my 14 pro and use the lightning for most apple things
Now Ifan says I love Android
of course they wont give you thunderbolt speeds theyre saving that for the iphone 17 after they disappoint people who thought it was coming for the 16
Ill pass Im still good with the 14 pro but yall knock yourself out
excited about the 15 pro definitely upgrading from my 12
Type C is big for me and the actions button is so cool remind of my old LGG8 button
I am most disappointed they ditched the mini They could have recycled the mini body for the SE easily and ditched the iPhone 8 chassis
"In regular versions of the iPhone 15 the USBC connector is limited to USB 20 speeds up to 480 Mbps like the old Lightning connector USB 30 speeds up to 10 Gbps are supported only by iPhone 15 Pro connectors 

But to achieve USB 30 speeds you will need to buy a meter Thunderbolt cable for 70 or a 18 meter cable for 130 Apple may also limit thirdparty charging power to 5 W 5 V and 1 A which will force you to buy only original accessories"
When are they going to improve their cameras to something comparable to Android I am always extremely jealous at the quality of friends photos taken on their Androids
not 1 negative point I guess they paid you now good salesman though
Good on the EU to make Apple fall in line and make their products more user friendly to the world Sometimes Apple makes some really stupid decisions like coming up with their own unique port connection Stupid stupid stupid
Samsung s23 ultra absolutely kills the iPhone Pro max
The video feels a bit sped up
honestly i think the ceramic shield is stronger than it gets credit for im still rocking the 12 pro planning on upgrading to the 15 and ive dropped it glass down on gravel more times than id like to admit and it still hasnt cracked
Its interesting that Ive felt almost zero desire to upgrade from my iPhone 11 since 2019 due in large part to wanting USBC and now after all this time Im still just not that impressed Maybe next year Or Ill just replace the screen and battery on my 11 and feel like Ive got a new phone again 
Why is usb c a big deal for iPhone if all the phones are going wireless charging
Anybody else here SOLELY for Marques because Apple stuff is a joke 
"I phone 16 features  
fast charging
90 hrz screen for entry level
Smaller dynamic Island"
yaaa  lets go out and spend 1K for USBC  FFS  Apple is such a nob  literally nothing worth spending money for and its a dying ecosystem due to failure of innovation
USBC Game changer
Apple has nothing new to really offer this time around lets see if they would do better next year
phonerepairguru 821
Im still rocking an 11 Pro Max so Im upgrading and then Ill be waiting until the 19 to upgrade again Im happy about the change of the charging port universal with my iPad Pro but Im not buying another pair of AirPod pros so Ill be keeping some lightning cables on hand
Currently I am using iPhone 13 Pro Max and its time to update my phone because my current phone has some issues I am thinking of switching to Google Pixel Fold But cant be decided to update to iPhone 15 Pro Max or Pixel Fold Waiting for your indepth review
Dam the phones out already
So USB C and no fast charge yeah Ill stick to my Samsung rn
Downfall of Apple begins Era ends
That pink color absolutely looks great Plus in 10 hours this video already surpassed pretty much every other MKBHD videos viewership ahhhh the power of iPhone
Is usb c port is it universal ya special cable required
This why marquess doesnt like apple Its the same design
Ayo can I borrow your Android charger an apple user
Congrats man 4m in 11 hours 
Meh Team Galaxy I may get one as a second phone and use it for business purposes only  
Does USBC fast charging somehow have a negative effect on battery lifehealth  If so perhaps thats why these phones dont support it
These IPhone guys 
"Ok SO why only A17 pro supports USB 3 10Gbits speed A16 supports only USB 20 and my iPad air 2020 with A14 supports USB 3 with 5Gbits speed The Apple way

The 550 ipad has 5Gbit speed but 800 iphone has 480mbit speed"
I think the real MVP here is the EU
Congrats iPhone users Us Android users can finally share our chargers with you
Are you guys aware a celebrity died on the day of the apple event
No Thunderbolt with USBC hmmm
Waste of money as always
This is probably the most unimpressive new iPhone yet And USBC How could they even present this as a feature The ONLY reason their new iPhone now has itt is because we the EU forced them to do it And now theyre trying to sell it off as if its not something literally every other phone including garbage Chinese knockoffs have had for years
"39 Million views in 10 hours

A testament to how much MKBHD is appreciated"
Imagine getting 4 million views in 10 hours and still charging 30 bucks for a tee shirt
Apple never disappoints to introduce something so boring Definitely a step up and better than the last and while bran identity is important this has been pretty much the design simce the iphone 11 and its getting old
Every new iPhone should be only compared to Android flaghships from 4 years ago
Wait am I understanding this correctly Apple had no way of differentiating the Pro from the standard iphones other than the camera so they downgraded the native capabilities of USBCs speed and no fast charging Thats how they made the Pros look Pro
"Going to buy iPhone 15 
Would have purchased iPhone 15 pro max because of large screen reduction of weight but It cost hell alot in India"
I love titanium I even ride a titanium bike But titanium is not Stronger than stainless steel Titanium is Stronger per gram than stainless steel So we dont actually know if the new iPhone Pros bands are stronger than than previous generation iPhone Pros We just know they are lighter It could be very well be that Apple engineered the titanium bands to be the SAME strength as the previous been stainless steel bands but they shave a couple grams of the weight mass of the phone Personally for the vast majority of folks who use a case I think it is much ado about nothing Now For the Apple Watch I think its a whole different ball game Since the vast majority of folks dont use a case on their Apple Watch the titanium body on the Apple Watch Ultra makes it noticably lighter than it would be if it were stainless steel and its more scratch resistant Those are super nice advantages
Im happy with my 13 pro max coming from a 6 plus Is still a huge upgrade for me Only had it about a year
I have never been more tempted to get a galaxy ultra  they get a crazy camera and S pen already been had USBC and Apple gets the same same crap every year
USB 30 is a pro feature lol my note 3 had micro USB 30 a decade ago
I may be the in the minority here but Im truly bummed they brought the USBC to iPhone without bringing true fast charging As you mentioned it wouldve been the perfect time to announce that and make USBC seem like its actually brining true benefits other than just helping get rid of a cable you probably still have to use for other stuff Im also feeling like chances are high they held it back just to add something to next years model as they always have to plan several years ahead but still just give us true fast charging already I shouldnt be able to charge my power bank that has 6x the battery capacity in less than half the time it takes my phone to charge Get with the times Apple
Def a skip phone my 14 is holding up great ill upgrade after some bigger changes
The thing we have to observe is the  purchasing trend How many people will buy a base model they would rather go for the iPhone 15 pro This may be because of the price variation between the models Only a few people would buy it However I would have hoped that Apple would have bought the same specification other than a few stipulations across the models Other than that I am happy that the iPhone is moving towards type c and a great variety of phones from them
Is it time to upgrade from the XR I cannot decide between the 61 inch iPhone 15 or the 15 pro Didnt have this pro issue the last time I purchased I plan on keeping my phone for 45 years again so leaning towards the pro
I buy an iPhone every 6 years or so
Bro g is genuinely disappointed
Wallet extremely safe
Video opens MKBHD gets to poke around and look at the new iPhone 15s Video footage opens bunch of people get to see and meet MKBHD in person
Congratulations on getting name dropped in the Keynote
congratulations on getting a Tim Cook shoutout at the Apple event
Gaming news is crazy Current gen games playable on iPhone pro
So pretty much they added a bixby button And an old usb c standard
Does anyone actually care about USBC I think most people just use the cable to charge their phone and USBC makes absolutely no difference to me I prefer lightning because I already have lightning cables and my airpods are still lightning im not paying another 250 just to change the charging port
"I might go for it mostly because mine is dying I like that in the comments most are just upgrading when their last phone gets too old not just for the novelty of it I was debating to just get an older model which might be cheaper but then I think I might reach the end of the line quicker and need another one 

 I have the iphone 7 bought around release and my battery is basically 2 hrs of use now a bit more if not using the phone although my 1 holds strong  good boy is trying no updates EVERYTHING is laggy I need around 510 seconds to take a picture my music or any audio stops for a few seconds then works for a few secs during videos or even on spotify it keeps disconnecting my apps from the internet so I need to close the app disconnect from the internet wait a bit then reconnect and open the app just to name a few issues "
Gonna still rock both my iPhone12 Pro Maxs until Whenever they do what I need
"2 things that are dealbreakers for me on getting a iphone
Usbc
Fast charging
We are halfway there apple"
Noup Im not upgrading this year
Excellent easy going presentation
Flyer wallpaper please
My first day working for Apple Welcome to the chip department  Me fists bumps neighbors pulls out jar of spicy salsa Today we will be designing the next generation of micro processors for the iPhone 16  Me confused hides jar of salsa I think there has been a placement mistake
Where is the 120 Hz display in nonpro models
The prices are crazy here in Norway so Ill stick with my xiaomi a few more years but if the phones were sold at US msrp here I would heavily consider switching back to iPhone after not having one since the 4s
So you and MWTB are both full shills mirroring eachothers vids these days or what
THANKS EU for stopping apples disgusting anti consumer practices 2027 easily replaceable battery babbyyyy tyty eu
So iphone is going android 
Heres my problem with the action button I think its a cool idea and I would love to use it to open like an app I use the most or I thought the flash light was pretty cool However if I choose to have that button do anything other than toggle the mute switch and I also foregoing the ability to mute and unmute my phone Coming from someone who absolutely hates muting his phone but obviously has to for certain situations ie work school court meetings doctors office library So I personally think that replacing the mute switch with this was a terrible idea because people who have to mute and unmute their phone often whether they want to use the action button as intended or not they wont be able to because they NEED that ability to mute and unmute the phone I feel they wouldve been better suited keeping the mute switch and putting the action button above the powersiri button on the right side of the phone Ngl pretty frustrated with this design change
I always take 14 x Fotos because that most closely represents what I see
Its actually funny like my old phone which I bought for 240 dollars back in 2018 was usb type c and the latest feature of iPhone after 5 yrs is type c port 
Getting S22 to S23 ultra vibes from this 14 to 15 Pro Max upgrade especially in black
For the first time Ill be ordering a brand new iPhone on release day Ive always been a late adopter getting mine a year after release This years Pro Max is too enticing to pass up with that 5X camera I attend a lot of concerts so that will come in handy As usual great video
Good to know
What is new Nothing
i was totally on board until you took money from those sleaze bags at anker
Being able to play AAA titles on pro max is a bigger deal than anything else imo
The way you said that the iPhone 15 has the iPhone 14 Pros specs is kinda misleading It makes it sound like the iPhone 15 has finally upgraded the screen to better than 60Hz which it hasnt
Even selling kidney doesnt work 
"lmao the same phone as 1314 now rebranded as 15 

Starting to get to a point of it being ridiculous 

ill keep my 13 mini for a few years"
Whens the last time Apple innovated
Am team now the  13 pro is cheaper
Why they never change the make and model physically WHATS WRONG WITH APPLE I M using 12proMax and wanted to change but why looks the same for 15 Poor
Probably the most said word in this video was same didnt count how many times he said it lol
They need tp be forced to allow side loading and apk loading
Im keeping what I got ya snobby bums 
Always been an Android guy but Im finally gonna try out an iPhone out of pure curiosity since Ive never had one I chose the right time because theyre finally joining the 21st century with USBC Overall Im excited to try a new OSdevice as a tech enthusiast
Time for me to upgrade mainly for the camera Ive been using the XR and I like the low light features on the 15 Thanks for the review
I can afford the 13 now
This is the review i was waiting for cool for the quote and the name drop As a long time fan I definitely smiled 
Ive been Android all my life May try this new one out cause the USB C change If I dont like it I can always switch back to my old phone and use the iPhone as a 1200 paperweight
Im gonna keep rocking my 12 pro  Nothing worth upgrading
Im thinking on buying this IPhone I have a OnePlus9 Pro Do you guys recommend me trying to switch to the Apple ecosystem with this ne phone
Definitely getting one of this
I have 11 pro max and it works Not in a rush for any upgrade at the moment Maybe mid 2024 I might get one
I am actually pretty excited for the iphone 15 I was thinking of buying the 13 a few months back being my first apple phone ever but i really like the fact that it has a usbc port The 13 and 14 i guess will be a bit cheaper when the 15 releases which is also a factor I will wait for the full review but i cant wait to switch to iphone from using android for years
So its a catch up phone lol got type C on literally everything but my toaster so Im good 
With usbc you can now charge other devices also from your phone
europe bent the apple
Bro was shocked he was being recorded on the plane
The shitty thing is that I have SO MANY lightning cables So if I got this new phone Id have to get all new cables plus my car has USB ports not USBC So Id have to get adapters or USB to USBC cables because Apple includes USBC to USBC cables
real change USB C NEXT
i am ok with no fast charging im actually looking forward to feel the titanium and having 1 cable for everything
Ive been told usbc is much more fragile than lightning Is this true
I hate how I just got new Airpods Pro 2nd gen and now they dropped the ones with USBC
Coming from the iPad pro 129 as my main video editing platform and my iPhone 13 pro max as my main camera Im very curious if i could actually download videos from the ip 15 pro max directly to my ipad pro 129 through usbc  I hope it works with a standalone samsung t5  t7 ssds that would be awesome as i would save a lot on bandwith and time tu upload to cloud and them download to ipad pro to edit
no just usbc
the one piece is real
the base iphone is more exciting than the pro this year sucks that its still 60hz tho
I have the 12 pro and I usually switch every 2 years because of the upgrades but I am still not quite sure that there are significant upgrades on the 15 I think Im going to wait a bit more to see how it performs
The action button should function like the air pods or beats where u can tap it once or twice or hold the button for different things
Sure its still glass but they specifically mentioned how they made it easier to repair the back glass It looks like a solid upgrade if youre coming from 11 or 12
"Cool
anyway whens pixel 8 dropping"
Bro even cheap phones have better usb c lmao
Im say this iPhone looks boring Im stick with my iPhone 14 and 14 pro max this phone doesnt seem interesting
Uninteresting upgrade
I DARE YOU MANUFACTURERS bring small factor phones some care for portability develop that unbreakable glass project that motorola had years ago that shatter shield tecnology create thin and big batteries that will last longer and make them to recharge via wifi or bluetooth or something similiar so when we enter our homes or stores the phones charge themselves BE CREATIVE AND USE YOUR BRAINS FOR ONCE
u sound like studio 
good luck with your IPhone 13 I mean 15 
Usb c android for the win
Apple is so boring now They just copy and paste the previous year
im okay with the button over slider which is just a dust collector and never used it the entire time
We all know you are an Apple fanboy
Switched from iphone 13 to s23 about 2 weeks ago waiting for the release of the s24 ultra iphones are great phones no doubt but the switching from the 13 to 15 isnt a significant change so went to a galaxy to see how that goes lol
I have a 13 Pro Max so its definitely looking like a skip year i really dont see the point in upgrading every single year personally especially when my phone is already so good tbh im not even sure what the 16 could have to offer that might compel me to upgrade unless this one breaks 
One thing that sounded interesting to me was the ability to capture video directly to an external drive Never thought I would see a capability like that in an iPhone I hope that works in all video modes and not just Prores only Knowing Apple they will limit it in some arbitrary way that makes it useless for most people who would use the feature
Damn MKBHD sound is good Man I jumped from another favourite techtuber to here and I must say Marques has like 3D pro max sound quality 
Thank You European Union 
My guess is that apple did not not add the fast charging feature since excess use can shorten battery life
"Hi I see that on Apple channel the comment section is disabled

I would like to ask apple that if their iPhone 15 pro camera is that good enough then why they wont shoot the apple event from iPhone itself that way people can get better idea of the video quality they would get and I know that YouTube does its thing on video optimization but I dont see it as a major problem as YouTubers too upload their videos on YouTube"
bruh i just want the plus version to have 120hz the pro is nice but its only 61inch and i dont want to dish out cash for the max just to have that extra size i hate this price traps buh 
Do you get a free USB 3 charging cable with it
Is it 1000 off if I trade in
Google assistant action button
how many people are gonna jam a lightning cable into the Usbc port and break the phone
I wont be upgrading from my 14PM I dont want USBC as I have had numerous USBC cables break on me I never plug my phone in for anything except slow charging The camera is a DOWNGRADE for my use case as the 3X 77mm is my most used Give us a 48 mp mode that doesnt require me to use Halide No battery upgrade No thanks
Thats an autotrader t shirt
Apple marketing is genius Upgrades to old but improved features Fast charging aka Super Charging for the 16 Amazing
Definitely not a lot of upgrades But cant wait to have less cables so in that sense USBC is worth it
For the first time I dont think anyone asked for the new iPhone Think about it
USBC  gay
Fast charging wouldve been appreciated 
This phone feels like the iphone 5c
The most intriguing things to me were the 2 new Nike sport bands  The 16 Pro should be the true upgrade from the 1213 Pros imo
Very disappointed 
Man apple really made you die wishing you had that hole on your phone
Im buying it done
Did the battery change Or is it still the same battery in the iphone 15 pro as in the 14 pro
They only went USBC because the EU force them too They didnt do it out of the kindness of their hearts or as some consumer friendly innovation
i bought my 12 mini bc of the ceramic shield and as many times as i have dropped it or beefed it while skating the phone is still in great shape just a few scuffs but no cracks at all the charge port is starting to give me a problem so the switch to USB C could not have come at a better time as soon as my phone is absolutely not functional Ill make the switch hopefully i can hold out til next year
Me watching but knowing I wont afford Iphone the rest of my life 
Cant believe they only gave the Pro Max the 5x camera so lame and nonsensical to fragment their flagship line
"A summary

Gatekeep features to make the consumer excited about them years later"
They should make them emit less cancer causing sleep blocking and brain killing signals This may sound like a complete conspiracy but just yesterday denmark forced a whole bunch of iphone 12s to be recalled due to how many harmful signals they were emitting
Its basically just usb c now What an upgrade
Titanium isnt stronger than steel It has a greater strength to weight ratio than steel does Steel wins out in a one to one strength test
I used to be an Apple Fan boy when they actually produced innovative phones It is now laughable how far behind Android they are WIRED charging Air Pods vs wireless reverse charging  No 10x optical zoom  No fast charging  No pinhole selfie camera  Its embarrassing that Apple users are still too addicted to blue colored Messages bubbles to switch to superior Android phones
So basically nothing new 
I still have my 12 pro I dont upgrade until I have to
I will be upgrading to the IPhone15 mainly cuz i still own a IPhone 6s 16Gb 
Why cant Apple add a chip for lossless Bluetooth steaming
heard the iphone 15 supports assasin creed and resident evilthat is also a cool future
I was waiting for MKBHDs review since he puts things into realistic expectations because Apple loves to overhype stuff
"One Port to Rule Them All
One Port to Find Them
One Port to Bring Them All
And in the Markets Binds Them"
Hmm I have a 12 mini Ill wait a few more years and get the titanium one
everything has a price even M bronwlee
Try to charge your iphone with ipad charge or mac charger That charger do so fast I dont know if that thing is going to damage the batery but give a fast charge
100 inMax Pro Thank U 4 YR efforts here
What Apple just did is called malicious compliance and they of course targeted the consumer with it  As if we should expect anything different
Literally just upgraded to the 14 last week cringe 
Yeah this is the most boring update in years if not forever
Apple is nowhere to run they heading to deadendwhich is BORIng
I was genuinely shocked that they did not call USBC something else and claim it was their invention Introducing iConnect exclusively on iPhone Kinda like they did with FileVault and so many other things
You mean iPhone 15 S S S
The 3d spatial video recording is going to um be widely used for some industries ahemyeah  If you know what Im sayin  It may really take off once people develop apps to convert the Apple 3d video format to be used on any VR headset including Google Cardboard for the poors
They need to start releasing a new phone every 3 years instead So pointless for a new release every year since the technology isnt changing that fast
If I could upgrade I would but theres nothing really pushing me to buy other than USBC but thats not really enough to me to spend a grand on a new phone
Impressive tech cant wait to charge it up with Anker 
When i think of IPHONES i think of BOTOX they never getl old lol same of the same shit lol
So is the action button one action only Or is there a setting for quick press long press double click triple click etc Then it would be a really useful feature
60 hz
Pff if it really gets lighter with the titanium Im going to get it really sick of these heavy last phones
"Thermal cameras should be on every flagship phone in 2023 
Just saying"
1111 This is lowkey game changing for me and i know a lot of other people who know what they like The general camera focal lengths are vary in range and to have a personal lineup of lengths is GOLDEN THANK YOU 
yeah about the end im broke explains it
I will be buying one of the iPhone 15 Pros Switching from Android since both sides of my family all use iPhone Plus I have a MacBook Pro Time to join the ecosystem I guess 
15 pro 1229 euro including tax and pro max 1479 euro  insane prices  everyone has their own needs 0
The 15 pro phones especially the max look exciting being a iPhone 14 pro user Im tempted to buy the new phone The A17pro chip looks exciting especially for mobile gaming
Disappointing how soft these impressions are on Apple  Its about to be 2024 if any company doesnt have fast charging and it takes 15 hours to charge the phone should be reamed
I am interested about new anti repair tactic implemented in this overpriced crap
As someone who got the 14Pro Max last year I am so happy This upgrade is so minor that it doesnt move the needle for me at all That said Im sure the phone is fantastic and people will be stoked and buy them in droves The gap between years seems to be less and less these days
Damn Samsung must be throwing crazy money to run ads on this video 
Biggest waste of titanium of all time
Yesterday morning my iPhone 8 Plus fell to the ground and the screen broke  Then yesterday evening they launched the new iPhone 15 Am I going to change my iPhone I think Im just going to replace the screen because the fact that Apple doesnt include touch ID on the side button like they have on some iPad models really bothers me I really love the design of the iPhone 8 Plus and I feel like I cant stand Face ID
Stop wasting money on these scammers
Im an Apple ecosystem enthusiast Im getting the upgrade anyway
My Ipad already has usb c tho
Seriously Snore zzzzzzzzzz
My most favorite new feature Connecting an external drive and shooting video straight to it
I have a iPhone 14 Pro Max with 1 TB and there isnt enough in the new lineup for me to jump over  Plus they only offered me 600 for my current phone and its only about a year old  I was expecting them to have some kind of crazy feature that makes it essential for those of us planning on buying the first generation of the Vision Pro  Im glad there wasnt that feature so I can just stay as is with the Vision Pro  USBC isnt enough for me to jump over especially since I only have a few usbc cords and Im drowning in lightning cords
Im upgrading this year it seems I pick a good year todo so
Answer nothing
Definitely in camp dont care at all Maybe next year
European Union ordered Apple to use USB Its not a surprise init
Yeah we know why theyre switching to usb C But you could actually tell your audience why This shows the level of censorship coming from the big companies even to a huge channel like yours
I watched the entire event While the chip improvements were modest by past Apple standards they were in line with Intel ticktock cycles Moving to a smaller internal process normally only yields marginal improvements  the next gen after that will see much better improvements For me two things stand out  USBC including USB 3 vs 2 protocol and onchip AV1 support Am I the only person excited for AV1 Yeah sure ProRes is great but it eats disk space like crazy and it is not very transportable off Mac platforms Ive been using AV1 on my RTX 4080 rig  it is nice for us that dont have infinite disk space So Im hoping that makes it to M3based systems in the near future
"Wonderbust instead of a Wonderlust
We have to put this into perspective
Apple is a trillion dollar company who has been succesfull through being disruptive in the tech industry since its conception 
The iPhone is its flagship product that has had 2 quarters of less than expected sales

A trillion dollar company just launched what could be an absolute game changer Apple vision and has the muscle to make it work even if it takes it some years has absolutely NOTHING important to base its new line of iPhones is to me making a huge mistake New colors who cares we all use cases new programable button Who cares A new charging cable  wow my god the UE forced rhem more of the same new camera lenses majority of users just point and click  Ne materials who cares a ini mini improvement in bezels etc etc etc

I can only conclude they concentrated all efforts on the apple vision and forgot about the rest of the line of products that to me is a monumental mistake

Last years improvements where nothing to talk about but this year  I expected a product that woul complement un MANY ways the apple vision understanding that Apple does that in all of its ecosystem I got NOTHING not 1 reason to upgrade 

Hopefully they will get their act together and launch a truly revolutionary product because in marketing there is a saying Whatever you dont do the competition will

When they spent a good chunk of the presentation dedicated to recycling yes its important but not in a product launch that is more for a PR campaign I knew by that time this was going to be a an empty shell of a launch

Apple for the second year in a row you have lost a customer that will not upgrade to a new Pro Max"
I know there wasnt going to be much However the whole line is pretty underwhelming
For a buying choice I will compare the new iPhone 15 pro max for 1500 with the almost 1 year old fantastic Samsung S23 ultra for 1000 This will be an easy choice for the latter
I think Tim Cook should resign lol Besides from quality improvement and price increases I havent seen much innovation in IPhone in last 34 years Android used to copy IPhone one to one and now the reverse has started This is not innovation in IPhone these are just normal updates copied from Android Android had this 810 years back I used to love privacy and security of Apple IPhone but I dont think thats worth paying 90k 15lac now Apple needs to work more now to maintain the grand identity they had because of Innovation and class and not because of there market share Very disappointed this time
Ill probably just map it to the flash light  lets be real
no fast charging my 2020 samsung a52 has fast and super fast charging
amker was literally spying on ppl
Let me get this clear The EU is demanding usb c from 2024 Apple introduced it yesterday as a feature 
Can Apple just make another form factor
I used to upgrade all the time Last time I went from the regular 12 to iPhone 14 pro Ill wait on this next one when they have usb c fast charging and Im able to take the Fake moon pics like android lol
why are you reviewing the iphone 14 again 
Im upgrading only because Im getting 1000 back for my iPhone 13 Pro Max
Meh seems like another minor iteration More interested in the Galaxy s24 launch next yr
It is just the usbc Your name was mentioned in the beginning and then you have no credibility
dude this is funny  android already had short cut button for years and newer phones are getting rid of it  like my TCL 10l  a phone that is been out for 4 years  and it has a short cut button  honestly iphones are getting boring by the year
I have a question that no one has addressed related to the USBC port  When the iPad Air Gen 4 came out with the USB0C port it opened up a ton of connectivity to other devices  I have one USBC hub with HDMI a normal USB port for things like a thumb drive a USBC port for high speed data transfer to an SSD drive like the Samsung T7 a compact flash poker and a SD port  Does all that connectivity come with the new iPhones and if so is it limited to just the Pro series  This is the main reason I didnt not upgrade my12 Pro to the 14 Pro last year no USBC on the 14s  Thanks
Everybody is telling that titanium is stronger but it is not apple actually did not tell it compeered to steel it is slightly worse but it is lighter nonmagnetic and heat resistant for the phone is probably better because you don need such a strong frame as steel titanium is slightly weaker and more scratch prone but it is lighter and still strong enough This heavily depends on the material composition in certain situations it may be different but in general steel is stronger then titan
Getting this one now
no fast charging is SO annoying
Marques  go for Apple CEO
What would be neat is if they used the usb c to make it a replacement computer They talk of compute faster than single core desktop cpu and gpu equivalent of a console I saw in details on the apple website you can connect a 4K monitor pro models if it just upscales the screen then its rubbish but if it allows something more like a tablet or desktop experience with keyboard and mouse you can truly have a computer in your pocket
Im in the camp who cares 
I want the pink one 
431 its named PRO because An ULTRA is on  the way
dont forget that despite a pretty similar screen standby mode is a pro only feature as well
Literally dont care I upgraded from iPhone X to iPhone 12 Pro Max like 3 years ago even then I thought nothing really changed I still got it now and probably will for another 2 years at least
Im in camp excited for iOS 17 but not too excited about the iPhone 15 so just waiting for my contract to expire next year so I can get the 16
After using iphones for almost ten years i feel like apple is not worth buying anymore Its becoming more expensive every year with little changes And you can hardly change anything to look different other than changing wallpaper Waiting for Samsung S24 next year 
"It is a shame that when switching to usbc they did literally the bare minimum possible and embraced none of the advantages of USBC Its a positive thing though more like actually standing on the right path but not taking a single step forward

Like someone said to Apple you have to be on the USBC train and apple goes okay and just laterally sidesteps to the lowest tier shittiest USBC possible just to be compliant"
Depends honestly apparently I get the 15 for free with my 11 tradein but having to change cables yet again is annoying so I may just go with the 14
I have an iPhone 12 and the 15 Pro is a really compelling upgrade all that camera stuff and build quality really is something else
I dont really love the new button instead of the switch I have no need for any of the other features and I liked being able to switch it off knowing the position of off and on Who knows maybe its great
So its an iPhone 12 with usb C Im so fed up with this horseshit company
"neither one worth the upgrade
And Dear Apple stop acting like politicians with your divisiveness and making two tiers of phones  one for peasants and one for the elite
Make ONE Phone with all the features that everyone can enjoy
Tired of their Bullshit Get a new business Model"
48 mp camera
The only thing Im upset about this event was not making a 2 TB iPhone 15 Pro Max and yes some people will say just optimize your photos and add them to iCloud and you wont need such a high gigabyte iPhone But to me having that extra space helps with other stuff especially for a heavy user for my business and school
Now that you mention it again redesigning the interior of the chasis might be a step to a future iPhone where consumers can replace the battery by themselves trying to comply with the EU Legislation by 2028
I feel like he was paid a huge amount of money to say shit about iphone when when we all know its the best phone out there as always I use iphone 14 pro max dropped on a glass a billion times NEVER BROKE
Anyone think its worth it to move from the 12 to the 15 or 15 Pro  Im undecided
The main point of USBC is to be able to sell iPhones in Europe  I love how they acted like it was their choice but they had no choice
Be fair and review new Huawei too
Only apple would take usbc and make pro features out of something that everybodys been using for years What a scumbag company
same bullshit just new portel
So where is the new about the iphone 15  the 60Hz screen refresh rate in 2023 this guy is a apple fna boy
THE PILLOWS IN THE BACK I NEED TO DEE THEM UP CLOSE
I think MKBDs Apple reviews are so fair He cuts through their marketing BS and is always even keeled on the good  bad
010 oh my gawd he KNOWS hes gorgeous Get it marky dam
Thinking about upgrading from my iPhone 11 to a 15 Pro I was really hoping for faster charging with CC cable
Same phone since the 12meh
Fast charging isnt good for the battery tho 20 watt is already fast enough just how much fast do you want your phone to charge up Its not a good thing you might need to change your battery sooner or may be even blast who knows
Titanium can catch fire too which is cool Nothing else interesting in this release Wait for iPhone 16 then
Wow USBC
Your freinds android phone
Feels like theyve just held back certain features to include in next years iphone pro because theyve run out of actual everyday value improvements Like USBC fast chargingdata transfer speeds and the 5x camera Theyll just add these to the regular iphone 16 next year Cop outs Apple Wheres the ingenuity Steve Jobs would be rolling in his grave
really pretty cool to charge other devices via  cable  come on
Samsung flip 5 ads on all the new Apple videos is wild
"Oh thats cool












POV me Stuck with the IPhone SE"
Congrats on the mention
A couple weeks ago I was using my Galaxy S20 to do reverse wireless charging to my wifes iPhone our friend was amazed by this  I said Im sure current iPhones can do it as well its getting to be old tech for Android  I guess not

"Apple is good at marketing but ultimately not much changed  do you really care that the frame is using a different metal does that change your experience with the phone
They claim the camera is upgradedand Ive seen media repeat that without checking but if you look at the specs it looks exactly like the camera from iPhone 14 Pro"
"Theres absolutely nothing here to make me upgrade from an 13 Pro 

Disappointed too that the 5x optical zoom is only available on the Pro Max Not everybody wants the bigger phone in their pocket all day"
Clean you apple watch band bro Too dirty

Looks like theyre pretty much run out of ideas wow a quick action button Android  tech from 8 years  ago  But apple is finally getting to where android options are the same  The watch os a different story Go apple I might het my first iPhone this year
MKBHDs attention to details is on another level Has anyone payed attention that the background pillows kinda matching with ID necklaces 
Very interested in the Pro Max  Currently using the 13Pro Max and its a great platform  Skipped the 14 so maybe its time to look at an upgrade  Definitely wish they had incorporated fast charge but at least we get USBC  Why must Apple constantly do this What a great bummer feature set  Well see if the 15 Pro Max is in my future or should I wait for 16  Thanks Marques  I really appreciate your attention to all the details
the main feature of iphone this year is USB TypeC people using type c since 5 years and apple made this top feature of his phone in 2023 how blind apple users are
"Nothing much has improved Of course you will praise it

Since huawei was banned youve been pro apple in everything"
I have a iPhone  13 Im good 
Does battery upgraded in iphone 15
Apple died with Steve  what we have now is just a sad zombie going through the motions
Still far behind from Android devices to make me switch The cameras hardware is still a minimum of 3 years behind Maybe one day Apple will get their act together
Lol USBC is a feature nice marketing job Apple What a let down
This man is bought and controlled by apple Cool guy but when it comes to apple he is in too deep with them now The new phone is a joke no innovation tell it as it is
USB 20 on a flagship phone in 2023 sounds like garbage Also no fast charging huh Also if I cant remove that backglass with a heat gun and a suction cup then they havent done enough to make it easier
People who use iPhone will always use a iPhone  I use two phones android and apple iPhone and hands down android is a far superior software for power users iPhone is generally rubbish with many limitations but the video camera sound and large screen in the max range is great
Planning to preorder the 15pro This will be a significant upgrade for me since Ive been using a 12 mini for 2 to 3 years now
Is there any information available for the sensor size of all 3 cameras not talking pixel pitch
"No way

 I have an 11 pro max Its in mint condition Was planning on trading it in next week for the 15 pro max and I just dropped it while at the grocery store onto cement cracking the screen "
USBC Thank you europe
Im hyped for USB C finally being on iPhone but I expect certain things to just not be recognized by the phone itself removable media some controllers etc Ill probably wait and pickup the 16 pro next year though Get it on the tock and not the tick if that makes sense
"Something new Huge deal 

Me bruh

Im out   "
339 samsung been doign that for 3 years
As a photographer being able to pick between hard stops of 24mm28mm35mm is pretty sweet Apple did just enough for the camera for me to not switch to Sony Xperia that acts more like my Sony cameras after holding on to my iPhone 12 Pro Max
"MARQUES
After seeing this review all I can say is 
Apple how about not screwing us over with mini implements to individual phones
and giving us  all the USB  abilities
My iPhone   13 pro  with 256 will be fine 
just one thing  would the iPhone 15 be an upgrade  worth having or not
Cheers
Rik Spector"
I still have a 13 Pro Max and I was really looking forward to a 15 pro max Now for the first time since the IPhone 8 is m thinking its time to swap ecosystems What would be a great alternative
Im still on an iPhone 12 and its runs fine and I dont see any need to change it
Not sure what they meant by the 15 Pros didnt go up in price The 15 Pro Max 256 GB is 50 more than the 14 Pro Max was 256 GB
i want to buy it but in eu the 15 pro costs 1200
Can someone explain their use case for fast charging Never in my life have I needed my phone to go from 0  100 in 3 minutes 910 times it charges up quickly with the 20W brick and it gets me just enough juice to last the night Who really cares about fast charging I wanna know how you use it
"No criticizm regarding the 15s base models still on 60hz screens but on the Pixel 6a it was a tier down 
Where is the display that reflects the price on the 15s now Interesting duality of approaches"
I have a Macbook Air in the Midnight color Would the blue titanium or black titanium 15 pro be a closer match to that
USB type C not by choice to innovate they were forced to use USB C
I bet not that many people bought the 14 pro max at the base storage level because you couldnt shoot prow video with less than 256gb so thats why they eliminated that model this year
Its crazy how apple make the same old phone and adds the bare minimum with a hefty price tag just pure garbage
It was great to see you quoted in the keynote
Apple Yaaaaaaawn
"I think Ill skip this one too

Im still sticking with my iPhone 13 pro"
Wow a connector that every other device has
I do not want faster charging The apple charger I got from verizon is way too fast Makes my phone overheat and has made my battery capacity go down fast And die faster than it would with my old charger
Apple will always be a scam an I have an iPhone
Which of the titanium colors fit the Apple Watch Ultra the best
How much for the iphone 15 pro max 512gb
Is 15 pro max 8gb or 6gb ram
I will say USB c is a compelling reason to switch However I would only really be tempted to switch to the Pro Max
You can thank the EU for the port 
I wish they would do a burnt titanium color
Camp  dont care at all 
You can add a portrait effect after the fact on Samsung Open the photo in the gallery tap on the three dots and lastly tap on Add portrait effect
This is the most underwhelming upgrade ive seen from apple
Apart from 120hz screen and a natural aluminum color the gave me everything I need out of the base iPhone 15
Its called milking it Apples new slogan should be we will milk it as long as possible
Apple sales will drop nothing new here
Its not just a game its Assassins Creed Mirage
Honestly why cant Apple at the very least redesign the camera lens layout Its been the same for years
Think Im going to just stick with my 12 until the 16 drops or a newer version
Im a happy camper with 13 pro
timestamps where are the timestamps
Could have been more interesting if they allow Micro SD
Nice  a different port that all other phones already have good job apple
S22 Ultra is head and shoulders above this peace of tin can 
Shoutout to all the foxxconn employees that make this possible
Who cant afford 
I have the 11 and the only thing that motivates me a bit for the upgrade its just the usb C
Nice looking but I will keep my 14 pro max for 1 more year to see if something will actually improve besides titanium and USB C which doesnt make any different to me
I think for my work flow at the moment being mostly shot on iPhone Ill probably upgrade and use my 13 Pro as a second camera Ideally I want to move to a mirrorless setup but for what all the max comes with its a nice capable in between for sure
Again Only for the rich
Good time to upgrade from the iPhone 7
Ill only get it because I have a 1000 credit with Verizon towards a new phone
You should be facing the window for better lighting Only the left side of your face is lighted properly
iPhone 12 mini is still good probably I will get iPhone 20
Reverse Wireless charge to headphones needs to be activatedI know its there cause you can reverse charge the mag safe battery case
Why is no one talking about the action button not supporting multi press functionality Seems like such a missed opportunity
Im going 15 pro max from 13 pro max because theyll give me a good chunk of money for the phone thats battery kinda sucks so Ill take it lol
Very innovative its funny this is what we have come down to
I went to the Apple Store app out of curiosity and I didnt see the MagSafe duo Maybe they already have a USBC one on the way If so Im definitely getting it
Why does it hav to be ur friends android phne it could still be urslets be realistic
Wow thats cool the 15 pro max looks good so might finally be time to replace my 6s
do not care   nyc  happy wit my 14 max pro
mid
Im interested to learn more about the Spatial Video mode and as well I was really hoping for a bump in the LIDAR scanners sensor Havent confirmed if its the same sensor of if its been bumped but they certainly didnt mention it during the announcement
"Maybe my comment will be the most obvious thing but Im seeing Apple just scrapping this great features other phones have and Im seeing them releasing the same phone year after year giving the base users the old pro phone and to the Pro users old Android capabilities that we had the chance to try for the first time like 10 years ago attached to the old Pro phone with a new too much for a phone chip that doesnt even use all the capabilities the fuggin chip can bring like USB 3 

U got USB C but no Thunderbolt for the ProRes stuff

And so we know next year it will have Thunderbolt we also KNOW that the battery will be fast charged we know But we also know that they release each year 3 oldnew features that people has been waiting since forever and they keep all the other features just on a roadmap for the future so Apple fans will have a reason each year to buy the phone and they have a reason each year to put up a new phone 

Wow that seems so shiny why the new iPhone Timmy 
 Well it has a friggin IR blaster its FIRE MAN how the hell did they got to this Now I can even control my TV WITH MY PHONE this is nuts
Yeah Timmy its nuts and also never seen before God bless the United States of Apple

I think that if you got to the end of this you may agree with me and never spend your money in an old and reliable new phone with a MAMMAMIA level in design and an INCREDIBLE screen made by Samsung or maybe youre about to throw up your hate on me but just keep in mind this might be my very first and last comment on YouTube so happy replying to this"
Isnt in the photography world 35mm considered the standard
will it charge faster because of usbc
In the words of Val Kilmer playing Doc Holiday in Tombstone I stand corrected Marques youre an oak Truly a master at your craft Sir there is a reason why you are the best at what you do You should actually give a Master class honestly the world would be a much better place and a lot of businesses and companies could benefit your ability to praise and inspire all while providing constructive criticism I couldnt wait to watch your review just to see if you would do the whole fan boy thing just because Tim mentioned you but you stayed true to yourself Something a large portion of people in this industry are not capable of doing after they get a ringing endorsement from a major brand God bless you Sir you keeps it 100 and thats why we love you Stay awesome and have an amazing day PS can you please do a review on the new upcoming Microsoft surface laptop studio 2 that is supposed to be getting announced later this month Really looking fwd to upgrading and would be all the more excited to here your take on the new upgrades and features which are supposed to be worth getting excited about Lets not forget how innovative the form factor is on this device as well and ensure to give it the coverage and attention it deserves as well Please and thank you And also before I forget can you also get on apple and do a segment on why they are taking such a slow road snail mail scenic route beating around the bush flirting were not dating just acquaintances approach to just flat out partnering with Sony PlayStation and paying them for the rights to be able to allow gamers to have some real actual triple A gaming options to play on the next iPad The reason I say next is because it would give them time to make the deal work out the details and get their RD department enough time to make a chip small and powerful enough that would put anything AMD can make to shame and announce to the entire world that while we may have been a little fashionably late to the party which of course is our style but we have finally arrived and to let it be known that if you want to do some serious gaming on the go then you might want to consider our new iPad They could cripple the gaming laptop industry if they wanted to Why just give us one game when you could give us access to the entire library Either that or maybe PlayStation should consider making a gaming tablet Either way it would be a win win for everyone
Tbh I dont think its worth it upgrading your phone to the newest one unless you see a drastic change on design or specs
Will I be able to use the usbc cable that I had with my Samsung or is Apple forcing us to get apple brand cables
Wish they would bring the alpine green back I still have a 12 pro so I may get the 15 pro What do you think
My legion gaming laptop is same price as my iPhone 13 Both of them are working fine atm but Im sure iPhone is something I have to change first
Once my iPhone 7 dies Ill probably grab the 15 Ive been kind of holding out for the USBC change
On a 14 No urge to get the 15 Sure I wont want the 15s or whatever either Might wait for the 20 nice round number 
"Name a more iconic duo 
Loser android users and oh iPhone just getting that Androids had that for years"
Theyre so expensive in Canada  Not sure that Im willing to spend 1129 for the basic 15 with just a 60 hz refresh rate
So to introduce innovation and global standard to iPhone the EU commission is needed
The true keystone of Apple has always been pettiness  Theyre going to act like petulant brats about the USB thing  USB for the people  Those are guard towers around the garden
Seeing this video and reading the comments and thinking I definitely need to buy Apple shares
Im not upgrading to the the Apple Watch ultra 2 its not worth the upgrade at all
Never been more disappointed in a launch
In todays sponsored video  yall just be consuming advertisements one after the other
Marquess omg wake up would u I have an iphone 12 waited for the 13 pass because it like an iphone 12 pro 14 came out and the same it was like an 13 pro then came the 15 just like the 14 pro but with usb c and 48 mp camera wow just wow marquess really wow ep
I love all things Apple That being said I have priorities Im still using an iPhone 7 because theres nothing wrong with it and does everything I want And it was the cheapest one they offered through straight talk at the time I do everything on my iPad Pro I dont have really any service at home but I do have highspeed fiber Plus Im 51 and I cant imagine watching anything on those small screens if I didnt have to Lol Great video thank you I always learn more from you than I do from Apple Lol
"Next Years iPhone 16 updates are out
We are now removing silent button from the iPhones Now you can switch it on from the control center
Apple  we are trying our best to make a big change "
I am really disappointed that the 5x zoom lens is only on the Max I would love that camera but I dont want a phone that big
Steve Jobs would have trashed these versions and we would be on iPhone 9 They Hey are just upgrading camera  and memory  they have run out of cutting edge ideas
Goodness gracious Apple only took years for a simple  USBC change
I think apple didnt include the faster charging so that people have a reason to buy the iphone 16 And they can market it as a huge improvement call it something ridiculous and act like it is completely new technology or something like that  630
I have a 13 pro I am just not feeling the urge to upgrade There doesnt seem anything urging me to change I charge wirelessly so the usb doesnt really make much of a change
Here in Europe the 15 Pros are actually more than 100 euro cheaper than the 14 pro
I wish they did a 15 mini 
portrait mode is ghetto
1 feature I was most excited for is that the satellite roadside assistance is coming to iPhone 14 models too I think I may hold onto my iPhone 14 Pro Max and get a phone a couple years down the road They seemed to be pushing performance heavily love these features but I have other alternatives to game with they are more of just a bonus Bummed they didnt add the ability to use an external display with the iPhone think thats a must have with USB C which could come in the future
I like how they said that 5x was perfect for wildlife photography when anyone who does wildlife photography knows that 10x is the minimum and 30x is the optimal
Im switching from a Samsung phone which Ive use all the time The biggest reason is the USBc port I didnt want to buy new cables just to charge my phone I am disappointed in the fact there is no fast charging But Ill get the 15 pro max
Marques where is the 2TBs version
When will they learn  
"Need to upgrade my XS Max because the battery drains in 4 hrs my camera is cracked and it overheats way too much cant even facetime for over 10 mins before lagging and turning off

 But Im deciding on whether to get the 15 Pro Max the 14 Pro Max or the 13 Pro Max The phone will be provided by my telco for free because I have multiple business lines with them but probably would need to pay a small addition if I were to choose the 15 Pro Max around RM100300 2565 

Feel free to leave your opinion because I have seen some controversy with the 14 phones in general and some would rather get a 13 pro max instead of the 14 line"
Not very impressive seems identical to every other iphone thats comes out in the last 4 years Ill hold off till they actually change something of note like drastic battery life and camera quality
my iphone 13 is great without that dynamic crap
3GS  6S PLUS  XSMAX  12 PRO MAX and I always bought them 15year after premiere so 15PRO MAX 2025 for me D
Honestly Ill keep my 14 pro max
I think Ill stick to my iPhone 14 Pro for a couple years until it feels worth upgrading
Not me a Google Pixel fanboy watching the iPhone updates just because its MKBHD and his content is always dope even when its things I would never buy lol
What does everyone think about runiing console games on the 15 pro You would have to buy a controller for it too and play these cool games on a 6inch screen i think its not worth it
Am not a hater but honestly speaking Apple iPhones nowadays are allergic to innovationwtf is this
Nothing new or special here from the Evil Empire USBC LOL man dont think they did that for anyones convenience they did it because the EU FORCED them to comply with a standard that is not proprietary and the US was sure to follow This company does nothing to benefit their end users and makes third party developers jump through insane hoops to create solutions for their platforms Nothing new here move along
Malibu Stacy got a new hat

Apple is going to slow drip all the usb c features that are commonplace to sell future upgrades Typical business strategy
Apple Introducing the Iphone 16 pro max The biggest innovation of this decade will be the introduction to thunderbolt charging  oh and we included a new shade of white
Ive NEVER used an iPhone Ive always been android but as of late Ive been tempted to switch for a generation and try it out This could be it
So we have to pay some extra money just for USB c 
If you will read this comment by chance in full review of new iPhone share your honest opinion if its really worth upgrading to newest iPhone
Just get you a lightning to usb c converter
"One plug to power all 
Im in "
Ive been eyeing an iphone for my next phone Ive been on android for 10 years Mostly I have been looking at the iphone for the enhanced privacy it seems google is getting worse with every passing year the new chrome changes are evidence of that The killer feature for me in iOS would be the inclusion of a work profile so I can have my work email and apps in a separate space of my phone Thats really the killer feature of android that keeps me on that platform right now
Looking forward for more reviews on these phones as I am thinking of switching from Android to iPhone my plan was to wait for USBC and now that it is here it is time to retire my old phone but I have not decided which one to get I have faith that MKBHD will give me all the relevant details to make informed decision as I am what they call a normie in a tech world 
I like the idea of customizable action button but i wish they kept the switch flip and make it customizable I can just take a look at it and tell if the phone is on silent Now do I need to unlock the phone
"I have a 12pro 
besides that cool island feature at the top of the screen I dont see the need to get a new phone"
Congratulations 
Its funny all of their new features already exist in Android for years the only reason to go for apple at this point for me is privacy  camera
510 Love owning Apple stock I would hate myself if I were an Apple fanboy precisely because Apple chooses to do things like this Android has spoiled me 
Is it worth upgrading to the pro 15 from the 13 mini
Title should add comma after NOT
Fast charging kills batteries
I am still with 8 Plus and i am wonder which will be the better upgrade  14 pro max or 15 pro Considering the price drop of 14 pro max kind of like giving small advantage in my choice but either way i needs some help deciding should i go for 14 pro max or spend a bit more for 15 pro
The very definition of an incremental upgrade And 60hz on a 900 phone is criminal
Marques trying very hard to sell these iphones to us its just not worth it guys
635 Apple is probably leaving plenty of things out for next years iPhone Regular iPhone 16 will probably get action button and might get USB 30 as well iPhone 16 Pro gets faster charging
I have lost the interest in buying new phones
This is not worth the upgrade from my 14 pro max this is very disappointing
I only checked out this video for the love of tech and of course MKBHD but this is another update not an upgrade to the new iPhone Lets be real
Titanium is not stronger then steel Why do so many people get this idea It is heavier  then aluminum and lighter then steel It is stronger then aluminum and weaker  then steel That is what titanium is
The event shows the impacts of work from home  Incremental not evolution not revolution They need to get in the office and get to work breaking new ground
woaaaaaah so its like an Iphone but it can now do things older phones could do that so sick doode
Congrats on the shoutout man You and your team are having a great impact on us consumers
Currently got iPhone 13 Pro Max and debating upgrading to 15 pro or the max Not sure if 1200 is justifiable
nothing in this makes me want to change anything ill keep my 14pm for as long as i can now depreciation is killer and i dislike being on the hook for upgrades
It felt like a refresh of last year and I was really looking forward to some kind cutting edge tech
Other than USB C I think the biggest headline is that pricing didnt change other than the max With inflation what it is thats like a 5 price decrease
Very interested in the 15 Pro I think it might be time to upgrade from the 7
Im hoping to upgrade my 12 Pro early next year Hopefully my trade in value will hold up
"How many iPhone users are really into photography and really taking advantage of that stuff 

Most people just need something to snap a random photo now and again right

You seem to value these things because YOURE into photography Its like cars coming with features for the track MOST people dont go to a track What percentage of people are really taking advantage of these photography focused features  and dont just have a dedicated camera for photography"
I only want one because of the usb c Might have to covert mine to it if possible lmao
I am so glad they are finally getting rid of that damn lightning port It was the worst I had to buy new charger cables every month and my lightning port doesnt even work on my phone anymore FINALLY
28mm is a more visually pleasing better focal length than the 24mm they introduced with the 14 Pro 24mm is just too wide for a normalstandard lens it feels a little off and you have to get closer to your subject to fill the frame  thats why they included the 12x default option
I have an iPhone 12 Normally just go for the regular phone Since I hold onto phones awhile I think Ill wait til iPhone 16 for USBC 30 to trickle down from the pro
iphone is dying its nothing special that people will say wow chinese phone way ahead in technology just wasting of the money and hardware
Possibly one of the worst new iPhones in recent releases Really disappointing
Great video as always I got say though youre using apple watch ultra on the wrong hand
I still have an XR so I think its about time to upgrade Not a mindblowing release by any means but I think that action button on the pro models would be convenient
im probably getting the 15 when it hits the stores still undecided about the color though no purple option
Well  apple being the ah as always 
Shortcut quick access on the button is killer  No 6x on the regular pro is lame Another year where I just want a small phone with all the features and would be glad to have a thicker phone if its about space Hate the phablets
I wonder if apple has redesigned usb c to make it not a failure point We will see within 6 months if it was a huge mistake to go with c I see 500x as many broken c ports than lightning ports Its just a huge design flaw that might not even be able to be redesigned and fixed in its current form That center pin setup is the issue And its also a huge step back on apple and its e waste things its started in the past couple years Lightning cables galore going in the trash
MagSafe duo should of been usbC from the start smh
Why they dont give us fast charging Maybe they have the data that most of the people charge phone during the night while sleeping  like me my entire life My 11 pro max and my current 14 pro max easily hold from the morning till the late evening why bother charging during the day
The iPhone 15 looks so cool Im thinking of getting the 15 plus or the pro max and im gonna ask my parents for an upgrade from my iPhone 14 Pro Max
Iphones are known for radiation problems Ill give it a miss 
Ive not bought an iPhone or any phone since the 12 Pro Ill keep using it till the battery annoys me After that if the 15 is still current Ill still go to the prior year that has all the bugsquality issues worked out Working at apple taught me that
Very little innovation this year with few genuinely new features Apple is running out of steam and is more interested in virtue signalling than being a leading edge tech company Theres little point in thinking about upgrading unless you are on iPhone X or older
"Its always a little changing thing 
But this year its just ridiculos 
A total dissrespect for the customer"
   756  
I was giggling when they showed the quote by you on the presentation Good Job man
You dont have to use CHEAP a lot rather call them AFFORDABLE
stop lying its an iphone 14 
Hm Cant wait till early 2024
Kind of a bummer if they wont let us have different actions for tap double tap and hold the new button
Man I just wanna hear about sideloading
Im getting the 15 pro max coming from my 11 pro max and I think the upgrade will be well worth it
Apple still being stubborn Typical
My charge port is broke and im still going to wait lol using MagSafe to charge 88 percent battery health I can make it another year The only temptation is 256 gb but not yet However I would gladly take an upgraded AirPod max right about now The phone is just secondary at this point
I am planning to get to 15Pro I record a lot of video for work on my phone  work from home USBC  30 will be huge for me for transferring those videos off my phone  I am temped by the 15 Pro Max because of 5X zoom but I prefer the size of the 15 Pro   I was hoping for the 2TB option I currently use 13 Pro  1tb version
Do this new iPhones have that eSIM shit I am planning to upgrade to an iPhone but I dont like the idea of not having a sim card tbh
Same iPhone with 10 percent upgrade from last year not worth the upgrade Boring presentation  Give us something New Apple
And i know you are going to put google assistant on action button
Apple propaganda all in all nothing new
"The action button seems like the coolest new feature to me
Of course chip and camera upgrades are always welcome but ever since the iPhone 8 I started skipping a year to upgrade my iPhone
My last iPhone upgrade and I barely convinced myself to get it was the 13 Pro Max and it looks like Ill be skipping this generation as well until yet more substantial upgrades and features are introduced"
I would like to know if the video quality improves in lowlight conditions
Who ever got samsung Ad inbetween this video 
Did this video seem frantic to anyone else
Apples  Watching on my 14 pro max btw 
Does anybody know if the action button can only do one thing at a time or if it can have multiple functions
I didnt bother tuning in to the Apple Wanderlust Event 2023 I was eagerly awaiting your perspective instead
They also mentioned that the usb 30 transfer speeds is with an OPTIONAL cable I read that as the cable for doing high speed transfers is not included in the box
"People will rush buying this thing I was one of them before getting the latest tech but people should ask themselves Do I need all this power What I do with my phone is callreceive calls message with friends or my wife I do take pictures but not every day just on vacation or at parties

As for USBC its not an innovation Apple was forced to adopt this They will lose money because they will no longer sell their cables and chargers

For me an iPhone 11 would do the same job at half the price"
As from your last video you stated the android was better than iPhone so I think Im gonna stick with my android for now
Forget iPhoneSamsung has been WAY better
Been a fan boi since the original iPhone still have it still works but I didnt do iPhone 14 Really looking forward to the Max Pro 15 this year  been a 2 year wait 
Linus called they need that seamless segue for their sponsors
Did they mention anywhere how much Ram the pro models are getting
Apple can  just never do anything right no fast charging not fully using the capabilities of type c Its clearly done on purpose so they can justify rereleasing the next phone for over price just to unthrottle the speed of type C and make it as if they actually did something special
The reason they didnt bother adding thunderbolt speed or any improvements made within the last decade is cause USB C isnt their great unveiling theyre doing it because they legally have to
My iPhone 14 pro max makes phone calls browse internet takes pictures what else anyone would need
It is simply ridiculous to not start the Iphone 15 at 256 gb in 2023 The pro max version should start at 512 GB for 1200 usd imo
"1034

The 1x 12x and 14x options shouldnt necessarily be called focal lengths They arent changing anything physically They are simply 1x 12x and 14x crop from the main sensor right"
"Marques Brownlee
How about Tim quoting you but only when youve said something nice and completely ignoring anything youve said that wasnt that flattering 
Thats marketing for you "
Why have no phone company shipped a phone with builtin cover Everybody adds a cover on their phone anyway So without the cover you can see more of the inside to shrink the thickness and width 
Its color fading Like a garbage using 14 pro max since 5 month
My galaxy s9 have usbc v3  Apple is cheap company
Looks like the old phone feels like the old phone has all the new features of a phone from 5 years ago I cant think why phone sales are falling with amazing developments like this
Its crazy how Apple have conceded with the crappy usb c that brakes all the time
Feels a little sad that Apple went from Lightning cable to USBC I understand why they did it because they werent given much of a choice but it kinda losses some nostalgia
iPhone never wanted to put in USBC they got forced to do it by the EU and thats a good thing
Yes the USBC on nonPro iPhones is USB 2 they state it at their website
Great video Does someone knows about the Ram
I have a 14 pro max so I feel no real need to upgrade The only thing I do regret is that I didnt go bigger on storage Shoulda got the 256 instead of the 128 but I think I can hang on till the 16 next year
I love my Samsung s23 ultra  and optical 10 Zoom 
How do you take a new phone give it the same stuff as the previous phones pro version and then come out with another phone in the same line up in which if you actually want anything different you have to buy the pro and pro max versions Apple really got people in a choke hold for money if they want something new lol
Im wishing to upgrade from my iPhone 13 to 15 Pro Max but I have to wait to see if it is really worth it or not
I dont know when to upgrade
Totally Not worth it
they all look the same
At this rate it will take a few generations before it reaches ThunderBolt so IPhone 16 will probably have USBC 31 then IPhone 17 31 Gen 2 then IPhone 18 ThunderBolthahhaha
I hope people realize that apple didnt give the pro version upgraded speeds they downgraded the speed of the nonpro phone
Watching this on my xs max
"Sooo
 it just normal a USB C"
Its surprising that after all these many years and all other phone producers most notably Samsung have been using its just now that Apple has decided to start using USBC cable Or is it because the EU had threatened them to convert to USBC cable Very disappointed
So same phone for basically the last few years now
Junk
Its ridiculous that the USB C is only 20 Ive wanted USB C but other than that for me this is not a reason to upgrade Ill keep my 13 mini
"I usually have been on the 2 year upgrade cycle for the iPhone since the 3G But I skipped the 14 and held onto my 12 Pro and tbh im likely skipping the 15 as well Dont really feel excited for the new features the cameras are nice but not must have for me  And I still have an old iPad and AirPods with lightning so USBC isnt something Im ready for just yet

My 12 Pro still works great and fast hoping iOS 17 doesnt cripple it"
why usb3 when you can airdrop
This motivated me to drop my S22 Ultra and preorder a iPhone 15 ProMax and the Ultra Watch 2
60Hz display 2023 flagship
Note 7 was the first Samsung phone with USB C came out in 2016 I hate that I want one just to finish USB Cing all the things
Weird Apple didnt use Thunderbolt 4USB 4 Probably you can interview the VP why
Im definitely curious to see if its worth upgrading from an 8 plus to 15 or even 15 pro Or if itll be worth upgrading to a cheaper 13 or 14
Future proof till next years phone
Does this mean the 15 promax will NOT come in a pink color or is it that it will come in those other colors PLUS 4 special titanium colors
Cant wait to upgrade from my 11 Pro Max to the 15 Pro Max Its been a solid phone since release but the 15 is calling my name now
Usb C isnt a big deal Dont blow sunshine after they were literally forced by law to move to a standard thats been around for years
Need landscape mode turn my 1500 phone into an iPad too
this iphone is just the Iphone 12 SSS
Funny IPad Air 4 has usb c and it has a14 chip and it has usb 3 speeds so why did Apple purposely slow down a16 usb c port on iPhone 15
Please test iPhone 15 Pro with VPN I need a phone that can get pass internet interference from apps use for job
Wait you didnt get the phone like one or two weeks aheae
Its not same PRICE in IndiaBharat Its 2025 costly than earlier
225 That was very uncomfortable to say wasnt it mate  Whats the holdup My Note 10 from 2019 can do that
USBC alone is worth the upgrade for me
It looks like 14 pro Design is almost the same we should wait till 16 or 17
Samsung  Apple hands down after this announcement
The focal length stuff is great because is full 12mp if you crop it after the shot it would be a lower resolution Samsung just added this to the s23 ultra too So now I dont have to take a 50mp or 200 shot to crop later Very useful
Eh Might wait for the Pixel 8
"This might be my hottest take ever but I really dont care about USBC

In my experience the cable is twice as resistant lasting at least twice as long but the connector is the big issue for me I have had 2 USBC connectors breaking on me in Samsung devices and its harder and more expensive to replace than a cable

Idc about the speeds I dont mind walking around with an extra cable I dont mind any of it Im pretty fond of lightning 

I dont even have many iPhones throughout the years yet I have an insane amount of cables whereas USBCs I have like 3 This is gonna be a weird change for sure Might just get the 14 Pro really"
Finna switch from the 11 pro max to 15 pro max is it worth it
They wont ever admit it but Apple got way behind on using a better charging port They couldve made a better splash with faster charging
if im right the newest regular iPad already comes with a usb c port i remember they adding a dongle for the apple pencil 1 for this reason
Not even one word about how sad the iPhone 15 is 60 Hz in 2023 for that price
So excited to preorder mine Friday upgrading from the 13 pro max Cant decide between the blue or black
"Im guessing if I ask Apple they would say Ill ask well see what theyll say  
Biggest flex ever"
"I kinda see how USBC is a big thing because having one cable to rule them all is very convenient
The only worry is that usb c is arguably the most delicate cable yet"
But why is my SAMSUNG 21 ULTRA still better specswise lol 
"Finally I unified plug on iPhone 
Now we just miss fast charging no camera bump on the back possibly to set standard apps moving icons to where you want or have it sorted from the buttom and not top of the screen "
Action button is worth 1200 Great Apple
I still have the iPhone 7 and at this point I have to keep a power bank with me the whole time Im thinking about either getting the iPhone 15pro or the 14pro since they are essentially  the same phone
I am not upgrading this year  come to find out Apple is giving up to 1k for trade in  guess why  Is because my iPhone 14 pro max is actually better than the 15 light weight That feels cheap  action button No thank you  better camera  I dont think so  I am keeping my phone
Im going wait until fast charging
iphone 15 new back looks seamless way better than the pro if only they had 120 refresh rate
I sincerely hope Marques didnt hop on a passenger flight exclusively for the presentation of a phone
Apple fooling world with the same phone as usual
The poor battery on my 14 pro max is enough for me to upgrade Everything else is just a plus
C cable what an innovation Thats it 
Who watched the video on tiktok were He had A GIANG CAMERA and he was filming 
I Dont bealive it is the glass that breaks its likely the oled screen gets those green lines
"Apple our biggest update  now u get USBC
rest of the Android "
Does any android offer an equivalent for Apple Advanced Data Protection If not shut up and get an  iOS device 
This next generation portraits should be added to iphone14 with software uptades I want that
Camp been android for forever but going to buy a second phone iphone15 JUST because Ive wanted to have an iphone for a while now but FINALLY THEY HAVE USBC
only color that isnt ugly is that blue one why did they go full easter pastels for the color pallete
Is this the generation to return to Apple I havent had an iPhone in a hot minute and tbh Im finding it mega hard to confidently replace my Galaxy Note 20 Ultra yet
The USB C is a nice change but not the driving feature for me to upgrade but I am getting the 15Pro As a photographer I am in desperate need of an upgrade I have the iPhone 12 base model and feel like I am not getting the most out of my camera  I almost just caved and got the 14Pro because of the major changes to the camera but I knew the 15 would have the same camera and even better upgrades Hello new action button I am excited to get this one
Youre still nothing but a fanboy Youre praising them for USB C yet they were only forced to do it not because they wanted to
Im VERY happy with my 13
Imagine buying a phone for 800 bucks in 2023 and it has a 60hz display
"Was mildly interested in upgrading but after watching this vid lost all inclination to 

Thanks a lot MK"
Android to IOS camp
Funny to me the only real note worthy change is courtesy of the EU
Do they really think we are fools
This is perhaps the most drastic change apple made in a decade and I love apple acknowledging phone gamers
You and a few other reviews always sing for Apple Doesnt matter how bad their simple features are These features are there in Android from the last 34 years There is nothing new
Shameless iPhone
Oh yeah USBC is enough for me to drop my Android phone and switch to iPhone no brainer  s
As an Android user the most interesting aspect of this launch was the new chip and what it means for mobile gaming  To me the biggest omission that I expected to see from Apple this year is 4k120 recording which Sony has taken the lead on with only a few other manufacturers being able to match them Everything else seemed pretty standard for an iPhone although the wider aperture 5x telephoto should fare well in darker lighting conditions Im going to see what Google has next month before making a decision or I may just hold on to my S22 Ultra until next year
Still rocking my iPhone 11 Well struggling with my iPhone 11 Lol Hope to upgrade if the 15 isnt too bad
Getting the pro I want the 3x zoom and I could always get an android phone for more and in fact better zoom than the 15 pro max pixel 8 pro on my mind
Love how apple gave a shoutout to Marques
Well I will downgrade to iPhone mini 13from the iPhone 13 max pro Maybe its time to switch to Samsun flip 5 Apple its joking to us
All those lightning dongles people had to buy junk now
APPLE ABSOLUTELY SUCKS
Its just USB C and as Elon  said 10 improve ment in camera
no ones talking about it being Thread enabled combined with the standby mode to make it a smart home display
And then there is me watching this video on my refurbished iPhone SE
Apple is REALLY good at alot of things like refining features before launch but also REALLY good at holding back basic things SO long that people are grateful just to get what everyone else had 5 years ago
I WANT APPLE TO STOP PUTTING GLASS ON THE BACK OF THE PRO PHONES SO THERE WILL ONE LESS GLASS TO WORRY ABOUT BREAKING Isnt it enough with the screen that almost nobody makes a case with a high enough lip around the screen anymore not even Otter Box that used to count on I got a defender pro XT for my iPhone 14 pro max and there is almost NO lip around the screen I HATE THAT
Wack paid ad dont waste your time
So it is not just USBC it is USBC without the feature of USBC Got it
For workinperson critical meetings it was always nice to discreetly flick or check the ringer button off without taking your gaze away from the person speaking to you You could even do this with the phone in your pocket If you make even the briefest glance at the phone it signals you arent prioritizing their time If I understand it correctly the new button is a toggle  you cant tell if the ringer is on or off without looking at the screen to confirm Thats a step backwards
I always liked the lightning connector design better than the usb c one The middle part on the usb c connector on a device reminds me of the weird hangy thing in the back of your throat
Its the back glass that sucks
Best Reviewer Out  keep it up MKBHD
"Its funny how they make their phones more repairable yet they make their components only repairable by apple components are locked to the phone We have to wait and see how it goes and if they still have this Also the USBC feels like a bummer as you said no fast charging the base model is stuck at USB 20
Honestly iPhones are their money making machine and they know people are gonna buy them no matter how little they upgrade them Sure they added some new stuff but it feels like its literally the same phone as last year except with USBC which is crazy
Will probably stay rocking my iPhone X for a bit now and hold my horses"
So meh
usb 20 is the headline feature god save us
All this shit on old androids or google phones Hyped up again
Damn what a let down I have a 13 pro max and was looking to upgrade but meh I couldnt care less about a camera and usb C
With the 15 Pro Max guess all of the brouhaha about 15 Ultra branding has flown outside the window
Hey does anyone know if his daily driver is an iPhone or something else Cant quite find the video
Wow so they gave us new colors some software a brighter screen and USBC thats a lot for apple 
USBC is EU law They are forced to use it  Its not a feature its a law
011 your hairs 
Went from IPhone to S23 ultra Never going back
Watching video on iPhone XS Max and its wonderful
Sounds to me if you own a 13 or higher already its not worth the upgrade yet But if youre in a 12 or less then its worth it
USBC is overrated
Is it true that on the next iOS update iPhone X will no longer be supported If so itll be the only reason for me to finally get a new one
Im giving 100 iPhones for 10 million dollars
Its Just A Type C  upgrade
im filming xxx content in spatial mode so i can rewatch it with the vision pro
for me the biggest thing was Resident Evil announced shocked you didnt even mention it
Thanks for info
The amount of people Ive seen complaining that they got rid of the silent rocker for a programmable button blows my mind People complain when Apple doesnt add new features to new iPhones year after year but once they finally do something they complain Makes absolutely no sense
lmao iphone 15 customers using USB 20 in 2023 is just hilariously sad At least its an upgrade from lightning
I only upgrade my iPhones pro max for the cameras I skipped the 14 Very excited for the new telephoto lens I just wish it came in the pink Not everyone gets the pro because it has a professional look But then again I always put a case on mine  I can get a pink one 
One thing is for sure all thunderbolt charging iphone prices are about to drop a shit tone as their charging cables are now outdated
Interesting to see if battery life will improve relative to the 14PM
Just waiting for pixel 8 to come out Same with new galaxys They all criticize Apple with the iPhones but they doing the same
I havent touched it but it felt like they are only pushing the fact that they are using recycled material I could care less if they are recycling I will stick with my 12pro for another year
Should I upgrade my IPhone 12 to the new IPhone 15
Anyone one has any idea about a new SE format coming out soon
I will probably be getting the new 15 Seems like an upgrade worth doing from my 13 All pretty interesting stuff
Hi MKBHD I see slowly Apple is becoming like Android What do your think There might be one day where Android users might switch it to Apple
MKBHD hammers on the Pixel 6A  a 400 phone  for not having a 90120hz display iPhone 15   an 800 phone  still has a 60hz display yet MKBHD doesnt even mention it
price was revolution and other stuff were evolution
Its funny how the base iPhone models get dynamic island but no 120hz Im an iPhone Pro guy but still
"This looks amazing
Must have it

 not"
I dont see a reason to upgrade Seems like it is the same phone with just another camera and usb c
I think the only noteworthy thing about the new iPhones is USBC Everything else is kinda irrelevant or incremental
Is this portrait flexibility such a big deal My pixel has had that for years Plus Google has the portrait blur slider along with change of focus point flexibility available for every image not just human portraits
We dont gonna miss lighting shit cable
Same phone with a c port 
"This is a very mid upgrade The 5X zoom camera is par for the course for any flagship phone of the past 2 years USBC has been standard on most Android phones for nearly a decade New processor claims to be so much faster and blah blah blah but having used iPhones and Android phones since their introductions Ive yet to upgrade to a new phone and be like wow This is noticably faster than last years model

I have by comparison opened up the box to a new Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and been blown away by how much faster it loads webpages how much stronger cellular signal and WiFi strength is by comparison to my iPhone 14 Pro Max and how much better the display is Apple hasnt done much to blow my socks off in the last decade"
iPhone law sales Now days that reasonable
Very disappointing that they just decided not to embrace USB C fully with the tech in the phone Makes upgrading not very enticing since its literally got only usb 3 speed and no fast charging
Are we even allowed to comment here with a Xiaomi phone
sorta regretting buying my xperia 1 V now
Time to upgrade Need that better cam Coming from a 12 pro max
crazy that a world government had to force apple to do USB bc theyre so against doing good by their consumers
"yeay big win for everyone with usb c
"
Ive got an iPhone 14 I see no reason to upgrade
Id take the 15 if I wanted to upgrade from the 13 pro which I wouldnt do
The guy in the back in the 2nd clip holding the camera at marques posted a video saying he thought he had the best camera setup there but marques was way better and made his camera look like junk 
The chip has the word Pro in it it must be good
215  thats me
I been running with the SEs for a while so this year Im ready to finally get a top of the line iPhone
I still rock my iPhone XS and it still looks brand new and works just fine but I think the time has come to upgrade to a 15 pro Not that I care about any of its features because Im not a photographer and I dont spend time to customize my UIUX I want it to work and I want it to be reliable You know kind of like my XS that has served me well all these years I expect and hope for the same reliability for years to come MKBHD as always youre the man thanks for the 411
Just checking if they are going to let me change the volume of different apps yet
"The perfect focal length button is worth it cropping is always worth skipping IF you can

Digital cropping has negative effects on vanishing point and perspective that you can only avoid by moving your feet or changing focal length You may have 50MP on the chip but the effective pixels per rendered pixel is much much less so your granular detail between low contrast and short wavelength differences is much much worse 

Better lenses options for default lens focal and more pixel density will mean more for the camera 

All of this nearly moot because apple has some AI thing repairing your photos piecemeal from other peoples bodies"
No thanks to the US government we can finally have some semblance of a cable standard for phones
"So Usb type c that phones had for years using usb 3 tech that phones had for years and a custom bottom that phones had for years
Nice"
I personally think the GPU upgrade is pretty significant I would say the most significant upgrade in the past couple of  years I cant believe that full PCconsole games are coming to the pro iPhones Overall going from 5nm architecture to 3nm is big leap imo
Is the normal 15 going to have 120hz refresh
Can anyone Gift me a Smartphone
No fast charge
I have a feeling fast charging wont come to Apple until they sort out their known battery issues Fast charging to shotty batteries probably doesnt help the longevity of the already problematic batteries
Did any YouTube reviewer bring a portable battery to test 3rd party USB type c 
For a 3nm chip it is not very impressive  It could be 25 time faster it is not even close granted you cannot reach the ideal but 20  is pretty lame Apple once again is screwing their customers
Mi iPad mini 6 have usbC with fast charging and 5gbps with the A15
Curious to see your comparison between 15 pro max vs s23 ultra Bc Im on the fence
IM LOOKING FORWARD TO APPLE 16 THEY WILL MAYBE DO SOMETHING NEW
Ipad yes macbook yes iPhone Ill pass They just havent got what Samsung have had for years Such a shame as I was going to switch but Ill pass
Im in the camp where if I need a phone this is what I get until about 9 months from now and then I would wait for iPhone 16
I want to get into iPhone i have  iPad mini and a mac mini but the 1330 for the Pro is too much 
Wanderlust event 
So nothing new
Next gen portrait was in pixel 3 
You only need an iphone 15 if you dont have any iphone from iphone 12
Its my year to upgrade through my carrier  Ive got the iPhone 13 Pro Max and I was planning on getting the iPhone 15 Pro for 0 with trade in but I might have to fork out 200 more for the Max after seeing this
The only remarcable thing here is that I am not getting a new phone
I was really hopping they did not change to USB C 
20 watt usb c charging Harkkktuiiihhh
Upgrading to USB C and not having the capability of fast charging while having their powerful chip is the dumbest shit in technology history that Ive ever heard in a long time Its 2023 and apple is still the biggest cock blocker in technology 
the 48mp pixel main is not bigger 14 pro  its just bigger than the 15
Going from a 13 Pro Max 256GB to a 15 Pro Max after holding out from upgrading last year I agree it wouldve been nice to see thunderbolt speeds One cool thing that you didnt mention was the ability to record those 3D videos that will be viewable on the new VR headset Im just happy to be able to match my phone to my ultra watch with the natural titanium finish
Im in a strange spot as thisbyears iPhone is released I have a 12 pro max and about a month or so after using it Ive felt the size is too much Its too heavy and too big to handle with one hand but having a vision condition I felt I needed the size bump now I know the standard pro size will work fine in better form factor So I was waiting to see what the 15 pro would have and it felt very marginal even for a 3 year old phone upgrade Yes better chip camera new design usbc are all good upgrades but I dont feel like its fully justified for the upgrade not when the price is so much Ive not wanted to upgrade on 3 year intervals Id rather wait another year or two but Ive wanted to get rid of the added size and weight of the pro max so I think I will and hope I can get about 4 or more years out of this one Thought I would with the 6 or the X or the 12 pro max so not sure why I feel Ill get more years this time when Ive established a 3year pattern but hey I can aspire to make it further before upgrading this time
I will definitely buy one of thesereplacing my 14 Pro Max with the 15 Pro Max  May wait for the dust to settle on preorders before going in to a store to handle and see the colors in person
You know whatd interest me removing the desk wobble p
This year there isnt interesting in iphone except their A17 chip
Dont have the money to buy it but still feeling good 
Imagine a bunch o engineers earning 200k working a entire year to add a usbc and some small little features here and there Life must be good at Apple
With the release of this new iPhone and iOS my poor iPhone X will finally get booted off the list of phones that get iOS updates  Been rocking her since 2017 and shes still alive and kicking with one battery replacement at some point since then obviously Gonna hold out until she dies or iOS gets a musthave new feature that I wouldnt get
Sponsor at the end of the video Respect 
davidimeli see the Fujifilm GFX100 II 1122 looking forward to your review
"Apple was so sneaky with the USB addition First off its unanimously USB 3 not 4 for some reason and only the chipset on Pro models support USB 3 controller for proper USB 3 speeds 48 Gbits USB 4 has been out since 2019 and all the Mac models have USB 4 ports was hoping Apple would push boundaries by including it Thats ridiculous paying 800900 for a phone and only getting USB 2 speeds 480 Mbits which has been around since the early 2000s Similarly priced Android phones to the 1515 have USB 3132 connectors and speeds We still dont know if 15 Pros have USB 30 31 or 32 each have different speed caps USBIF needs to mandate companies to list data speeds not just a generic USB 3

That 15 Pro better be damn worth the upgrade because the regular 15s are definitely not worth it if you already have a 14 The only thing Im sorta excited for is the action button cameras OLED panels being standard and being able to use it with other USBC deviceswhich will be limited in applications due to the lower speeds"
Same phone Waste of money to buy this one
The only difference is it will not allow my family to take my USB C chargers Im the loaner Android holdout never had an issue until now
you are pro apple person how do you justify 60hz screen on a phone in 2023
People need to stop obsessing with fast charging You dont need it You think you do but you dont Its like owning an RV Will you go on a road trip once a year May be But its not worth owning one for a single trip every year
15 Pro phone being able to record video to external storage is really cool
also is there a sim card tray or
The Only New Thing That Apple Adds to Iphones Every Year Is  100
welcome to 2023 apple fanbois
Its quite funny how people are getting excited about the Button i have a samsung galaxy S10 from 2020 and remapped the bixby Button so thats essentially the same xD
Iphone 18 pro will have punch hole display 
tbh pro motion is the only thing i wanted in the regular 15 and the lack of it makes me want to switch to a 13 pro
iphone 15pro comes with usb2 how humuliating
I think Im done with Apple after this I have a 13 pro and Apple seems to be stuck in the past tech wise Guess I need to learn about other brands
Every year Apple releases a new iPhone that is better than the previous one Its like theyre trying to make us forget about our exes
All I want is an IPhone 15 mini 
lets make even less difference between generations they will still buy it in rows because its a NEW iphone Are we really this dumb
yo congrats on getting that shout btw i think that they are doing the same thing they did with the ipad where its price ladder the iphone 15 and 15 plu sis good but i want more features a specific one then you go to the pro and then you realize the pro max is only a few hundred dollars above so end up getting the pro max
its all dissappointing
weve been doing this since 2007 at this point everyone should be in the dont care camp
damn it upsetting that the 5x lens is exclusive to the max  how am I supposed to type with one hand with that big ass phone
My comment could be excessive but the cables and these accessories were the reason I left using apple products Those accessories that have like a 1 year useful life built and designed to look good instead of practicality was deal break for me I am sure you are looking now to you full stain almost gray apple cable now and your phone charger looks too scrape off from the usage iPhone is still a good device but for power users there are better smartphones and computers For the final user nontechy ones this is the product Also it is quite disappointing that the most significant thing in innovation is the USBC
everyone saying same thing really just wants the new phone
Apple take one full year to make this new iPhones and still same I keep my 13 pro
I think the biggest updates came in the OS The hardware updates are minimal if you have a 14pro Ill be keeping my 14Pro 1 more year
Wow the only NEW feature is basically USBC and they still skimped on it by giving USB 20 speeds to 15 and 15 plus if thats not a rip off what is
Is this a 14 or 15 cant tell
Im deep into the Apple ecosystem Ive been looking forward to the 15 pro max for a long time Im all in
USBC is the main reason Ill be buying my first iPhone before the year is up Ill still use my Galaxy 21but Ive gotten in the Apple solar system kinda deep so might as well go all the way Nervous about the learning curve 
Thanks for this a good precis Titanium appeals to me but Im on an XS so way behind the curve The depth info on images is the most impressive thisng for me very pro photographer potential
"Finally USBC 
Last time I plugged my iPhone Pro for data transfer NEVER Using AirDrop or iCloud sync are ideal but Im locked deep into the Apple ecosystem"
So they are offering stuff Android has had for 7 years Sounds like a HuaWei mate 60 moment lol
"do not buy this junk
france banned sales for way to high radiation
apple is raising bar for joke company"
the default zoom options are because of how they line up with full frame sensor equivalent focal lengths
Bro is the king of phones
Apple is boring 
So its iPhone 16 than
What iPhone is this They all look the same
Ill probably buy the 15 Pro Max just so I can finally use USB C between my two phones
Honestly shocked by the USB C but so happy to see it Also excited about the 5x telephoto Im interested
pathetic Apple pathetic Still 60Hrz in 20232024
I personally think they should have gone with carbon fiber instead
Thanks but I will stick with my Android phone for now rather than using this stone age technology phone my Android phone has ultra fast charging it gets from 0to100 in just ten minutes and the latest snapdragon 8 gen1 processor 
Writing from an iPhone 11 Pro and I still dont get the feeling to switch it for the newcomers
They are saving the fast charging an a new feature for iPhone 16
The iPhone is not interesting at all anymore Samsung is so much better 
Oh wow USB c
Its crazy how apple limits everyone its really sad
I was optimistic about upgrading this year but due to the lack of differences Im gonna stick to my 12 pro max for another year
Sticking with my 14 pro max looking for a bigger change
These are definitely the smallest changes ever Imma stick with my 14pro max
Booooooring
Apple fools us  true innovation will be  the phone that can refuel itself
Seriously Android is launching something better Everytime 
Great job on the video Marques Thanks for making it
Waste of money 
ill waiting for the last version apple phone  then ill buy it 
Finally this year i will upgrade from my XS  lol
What pisses me off is that the iPhone 15 is basically the iPhone 14 pro but the new features for the camera will not arrive to the old model
What about the battery problem
Was not worth a years wait
Lolanother iPhone with the same  tricks
I want that wallpaper
"Here is what I have understood about Apple over the years Apple does bondage and dom play with their users some havent experienced anything like it and love it wile the rest move to other devices and brands
There is no other explanation"
Finally they are getting closer to Android experience
mid year theyll come up with somethin else ull see all the quick ill get the new one now people will be left behind when new one arrives
Dont care very minor upgrades not worth it if you have an iPhone 12 or later
Well I determined on Apples iPhone compare site and theres nothing major improvement from my iPhone 14 pro max to the new iPhone 15 Pro max so Ill skip the upgrade But nice video mkbhd I dont need a titanium frame or usbc and really A16bionic isnt that much less powerful than new A17pro chip
Is it just me or is that action button going to just be used to silence the phone for most people I know personally that what I would stick with berceuse I need to have a quick to use button to silence my phone while in class
Im not going to be upgrading my iPhone 13 Pro Theres not really a huge value proposition to me The only reason I even have this phone is because our carrier offered it for 100 with a new plan
OLADIPO is that you
Ive been waiting for USBC since I bought an iPad that had it I was really hoping there would be more added than just that though
Ill update my phone when they give you faster USBC charging and faster transfer speed than lightning cable to baseline iPhones
I like the iphones but as a Samsung user this next generation portrait mode has been in my phone for quite some time If I click a pic I can later on go and add portrait effect to it So I really dont know whats the big deal with it lol But ofc Apple has its Apple way of presenting things which make it seem like its so new Kudos to that lol
I wont buy another iPhone until the camera lenses are flush with the backplate so I can use wireless charging pads
For sure it is very likely there is a USB conversion going on between the old lightning controller and the new USB connector As well as limitation on the A16 CPU already having the lightning controller onboard For most people it wont matter to have a sub 500 Mbps data speed but for those that transfer large media files it will be a big deal
damn if i were to buy the baseline iphone 15 then it would be a downgrade as my oneplus 8 has the usb c 31 gen
It is just TYPEC LOL
I think the EU has given a time line for usb c so the others will come soon I think they just did it last moment because they couldnt go around it so no extras
Im surprised they went for it this year since afaik they dont have to comply with EU laws till 2025
"the action button looks ugly as hell The Switch thing could also be redefined with a small update u dont need to add a ugly button And they even didnt upgraded the USB C to 30 lmnao its capitalism at its best next year my friends it will be a Huge update for another 1300 xD
The new 15 Iphone is just not worth the money Im waiting for Iphone 16 or 17 mini withouth actionbutton pls thank you apple"
I want the blue 15 I have the 13 rn so maybe Ill get one
Possibly the most unimpressive iPhone ever They need to stop releasing these yearly
Im so happy to get a 15 pro max with the same 5 design hooray 
Is this phone worth to upgrade from 12 pro max
my question is Ive seen they presented that the iphone can now be on stand by mode so does that mean they fix the battery issue where you need to charge only up to 85 and use it down to only 2030
Im upgrading from an 11 Pro Max  Very interested in detailed color comparisons
they showed a demo of a game with faster raytracing no way you skimmed over the fact that they are porting 4 CONSOLEPC GRADE GAMES to a mobile phone
The greedy apple has finally decided to put usbc
Wheres the AirPods Max update 
Waiting for pixel 8
"Finally USB C 
Where is Fast charging 
Where is 120 hz 
Overall Big Loss for Budgets Teams"
Eh I could care less My 13 pro max still works fine Maybe next year or the year after Or until I make 10k a month lol
899 usd Here in Australia the pro max is 2199
Most used word same 
Oh no 1 to 2 hours to charge your phone Slower charging is better for the cells in the battery Anyways Higher charging speeds mean more heat and heat and batteries Do not get along Im not an Apple fan at all but they could be limiting charging speed to reduce even more battery degradation than Apple phones already get
How do you feel being quoted in Apples event
Apple needed to provide two ports here one Lightning for the legacy accessories and an additional USBC port  One port wasnt enough when it was just the Lightning port and its not enough to have a single USBC port
"Biggest bummer for me is the death of the Mini again I have the 13 mini and its absolutely perfect I hate that the only options are Big and Bigger or have to go with a toy phone The mini has gotten such a bad wrap due to the 12s battery issues but I feel like i never have to charge my phone or worry about battery at all with the 13 mini The mini with the apple wallet that fits perfectly is the best daily driver 

Sigh Mini phone minority i guess 

As an aside i wish Apple would take more risks on the software side as the hardware is getting so incremental I switched from Pixel 7 been on pixel since the nexus 4 to the 13 mini for just the mini phone size and there are so many annoying inferiorities esp around app findabilityorganization notifications and the crazy annoying alerts that interrupt and take over the screen Drives me nuts I have seen android completely reinvent and refine itself probably 7 times where as iOS has been pixel pushing since launch"
Same iPhone since iPhone 12 Apple needs some innovation
I love the new type c port  action button
"215 Yeah when the mfi program died
mfi program is still on 
I think iP15 will only support the mfi certified cables
Else youll get that accessory not supported message"
i have the Iphone 14 pro is it worth buying 15 pro
Ive been waiting for apple to make a usb c for a long time I never thought they would actually do it
I think iPhone 15 is good as per specs and price point which is same as iPhone 14 Just wanted  120Hz display which will make people confuse over iPhone 15pro but price difference is substantial so may be mass like me will go with iPhone 15  Titanium body will not make much difference as per price difference
34 mil in 9hrs most rappers would kill to have these stats 
Sitting here with my iPhone 13pro cuz US carriers do 30 month phone plans now 
The European Union forced Apple to change to USB
New phone another money to spend  Apple for you
I upgraded from 13 pro to 14 pro accidentally used my 13 pro the same day for hours before i noticed i was using the wrong phone Ill stick with my 14 pro for another year and switch to 16 pro when it releases
Apple did this before with the Max camera to test features dont think its the space
Damn it yet another feature iPhones are stealing from Android
love the subtle first class flex haha
What about screen refresh rates
Is it worth to upgrade to pro from iphone 13
So basically they enhanced their camera slightly and charge 1000 for it Ya no thanks
Im very interested in the new iPhones And I think its great that they switched to USB type C but my iPhone 12 Pro Max still does everything I need it to do Probably just going to keep it in pocket until they stop supporting its software
So can someone tell me the exciting features of this years iPhone Propromax Theres no way that the action button and USBC charging port is worth upgrading for me
A waste of time
Tim wasnt Cooking with this one
I find it offensive that they highlight the USB C as their key innovation while excluding a plethora of features that would enhance the phone and provide them room to grow for future models
Can we just boycott this until they reduce the price or give it more improvements  Ridiculous how people just throw money and accept anything even if its the same
Totally getting the new pro max Im currently using a XS Max so its time for a change I was going to get the 14 pro max but when I heard about the usb c I decided to wait
For the first time since the release of iPhones I couldnt care less Ill wait for the 16
Am I the only one that thinks a new Apple Event is equivalent to Yeah new IPhone means older models will get cheaper Who cares about the newest ones Has a lot of stuff I will never use in my life anyways
didnt the HTC One M89 have that same take the depth map always for adjusting the focal point seems to ring a bell
I think Apple properly are targeting the Cinematic level users on the Max model with the USBC controller This may be a boost in the TVFilm production industry for the price of a Max and its pro level camera capture capabilities
The 15 inch iphone is the best 15 inch iphone in the world
the compatible android charging usb type c 
What Im excited to see is if my Pixel USBC cords or my collection of Anker USBC cords will work normally with this that way my wife and I dont have to worry about forgetting cords when traveling
No lie Apple is playing all of us Pure cash garb with this release We dont need an over price phone We need money for our rent Facts
Many fingerprints on the phone never had that caught my eye before Will it show fingerprints fast
Welcome to USBC in 2023
I really dont understand how you think its acceptable that in 2023 a base phone can come with 60 hertz displays and still cost as much as the iPhone does when reality youve given Android phones that have come out with 60 hertz like the pixel 6A a lot of garbage in the last few years
USB 2 really apple
sounds again like nothing really new here 
Apple got rich off the chargers and said forget those
WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR 
"Want to buy and upgrade from my 11pro max 
Feeling iffy about it tho"
Looking forward to getting one of these Will also be my first time using an apple phone
Was expecting to upgrade my 12 pro but now I know there is no reason at all to Guess I can blow the extra money on apple vision
i do actually zoom in for every photo snapchat does it automatically too it makes the perspective more realistic as to actually being there
As an iPhone 13 mini user Wont be upgrading  I wish they would bring the mini back  Usb c is good to see would like to see it across the entire apple lineup
"They couldve made a iPhone air 
Or iPhone 15 pro air"
Still nothing good enough to get me to ditch my 13 mini
I waited until yesterday Now I have decided to go with Samsung They are here from time travel
"USB c but no fast charging 
Typical Apple scumbag"
Im afraid some company would copy Apple on using old processors at base models TT
The only think I am worried about with is if the titanium shield for the pro will easily get scratched with a case on
We all thought Apple was going to do passive aggressive and hostile thing that Apple always does  Eliminate cable charging to take advantage of a EU law loophole
This video like Apples presentation yesterday could have been told in 5 minutes
Fast charging is terrible anyways it destroys the battery But it sure can be useful in some cases 
Does anyone know if it has the same button layout as previous phones
15 is the most boring launch so sick and tired of seeing the same iphone design for 4 years in a row
nothing weird about liking the natural the most its the best color
On the fence whether to replace my iPhone 12 Pro 256GB  Still works perfectly and it spends most of its time in a secure locker at work so 1100 is a lot to justify for the 15 Pro 256GB  Ill prob have a look at IOS17 first
Is he reading a Apple script
Should I stay with my 12 pro Max 
So its the IGalaxy now lol
I currently have the iPhone 11 Ive had it for 3 years and I am thinking about getting iPhone 15 but idk is it worth it
Not sure yet My 13 Pro Max is still good but I could give it to my wife since she broker her phone
My IPhone 14 pro Max is at 89 battery health Should I hold out for next year or upgrade
Camp dont care
First time where iPhone are cheaper than previous year in France
Shit was trash Lmao I still have the 12 pro and I wont even change yet
Probably get the Sony Xperia 5 V
only apple fan boys can be excited to get the old usb port LMAO
Did they realize how much waste was created by this lightning port thing when they talking about mother nature and carbonfree
Those inovations brings apple to 2019
"Im wanting to know how big of a difference there is between the 15 pro and 15 pro max cameras are
3x zoom plus 2x digital vs 5x optical zoom"
Im on an 11pro max because Ive had no reason to upgrade yet Nicer cameras and being 4 generations behind might finally get me to upgrade to the 15pro max
Marques looks so sad and Nostalgic about this new Iphones
Is it just me or is this the most disappointing September release yet
So this new wave of semi updated iPhone is not worth upgrading Never would have guessed 
Apple script voice over by Mr Brownlee
A lot of folks just follow the hype thats the problem be happy with what you have Ill use these IPhones until they break I dont waste a dime on em
Not talking about the new video features especially from Marques is wild Probably has a dedicated video on it haha
Used to be apple fan boy but switched to samsung back when S9 came out Currently rock s22 ultra but do not use the stylus at all and with apple going usb c thinking of switching back
"For anyone that has seen or used an android recently  this is pretty meh as there is little new or interesting to make the switch to an iPhone For anyone that has been in the Apple ecosystem alone its a solid upgrade

Depends on where you fall"
why dont you mention that many android phones with usbc dont have usb30 but 20
Does it seem worth upgrading from 14 pro to the the 15 pro or would you wait
MKBHD asking thrice in a single video to subscribe Somethings up
Nothing impressive for Apple at this event The series 9 watch is a joke
The USBC is a big yawner Most people will not care
So excited to buy this phone in 5 years
"Literally zero incentives to upgrade from 14 Pro 
And the only interesting change is USBC thank you European Union"
When we will be getting IOS 17 update for old devices 
1107 authority of android 
Lol gotta love Next Gen Portrait mode I had that on my Galaxy S5 in 2014
northing new really
The regular 3X from last year 
if you like small light phones iPhone 15 is the lightest even more so than iPhone 14 I have iPhone 14 pro and going for just iPhone 15 It has 14 pro features but lighter
iphone has become a dissapointment every september
Was looking forward to your Video about the iPhone 15s as soon as the event concluded Tim quoting MKBHD in the opening presentation about Macbooks was totally insane and cool As always awesome video and review
743 glass is glass and glass can break  jerry
Im going to continue using my iPhone 13 mini until its collectible 
So basicly nothing is new from 14 to 15 understandable have a nice day
Apple really androided on that action button
152 correction the cheap base iPad already has USBC
2023 and people will have a phone with usb2 
"The true change is seeing Apple opening up to customisation No matter how you look at it phones are more than slabs for texting calling and taking pictures 
Welcoming the action button and the freedom of its usage"
I really wish the 15 Pro had the 5x lens I really want that lens but dont want a big phone
I dont think any of the iPhone 15 user really need usbc 3 i think its enough for thte iPhone 15 Pro
Camp DontCareAtAll
still no call recording option 
"My Note 9 also has the Action button 
Samsung calls it the Bixby button 
I set it to toggle flashlight using Tasker"
The timing on that staring guy in the middle at 1023
Really surprised they didnt do fast charging I wouldve thought that fast charging incentivizes users to use their phone more frequently and thus make it degrade faster so they can buy a new one earlier
no 120hz on the 15 regular one 
To be honest the portable power bank like the one you sponsored isnt going to replace my MagSafe Battery Pack any time soon Hopefully the 15 Pro Max supports using the one with lightning charging
Marques been a fan for a while keep growing and stay blessed brother
I held on to my iPhone 12 Pro with the expectation Apple would eventually have USBC phones just based on the EU requirements  For someone like me with a 3generationold phone these are all welcome upgrades
Im in camp Hmm  I mean the difference isnt huge coming from a 12 pro  I dont know I think I had enough of Apple feeding me this great hope of new and improved lingo When things finally come front in center your left with last years goodies repackaged  Now if you want something with a real change you have to buy a bigger phone Ill probably hold off this year and focus on purchasing a nice TV for the living room  Great thoughts as always though Marques your editing skills are butter
I will get it cause the CPU is 10 percent better than previous so I will crush mobile games and I feel godlike and Samsung ultra 23 users will be jelaous
I think the brighter screen will be the sneaky best upgrade to these new iPhones Not saying that makes it worth the upgrade but that might be the best new feature
My cheap android has double tab side button  flashlight and I use it so much every day No fiddling just immediate light I wish I could do triple tap
Paying over 1200 just for typec
So Last Gen USB C with some other software updates Why do i feel like the last few iPhone iterations have been smaller updates than the mid series S models used to be
What can apple introduce with the new Iphone the 15th Iphone let me just answer that question NOTHING Facts are after Steve Jobs is not among us its same from 615 deal with it Oh new chip is on oh new cam is on oh wait the port changed to something everyone uses since 2014 thx apple for nothing
"I have the 12 pro and tbh I havent seen any real reason to switch to the next phones yet
Id say I have up until maybe the iPhone 17 before I consider switching tbh"
CRAP 
the fact that 15 isnt at least 90hz in 2023 is oof
Apple will sell you the same shit you bought last year and you are gonna like it
Usb c did impact innovation in iphone Theres literally nothing else they could find the time to do in iphone 14
summery  same iphone from last year
HOLY CRAP 164k likes in 9 hours
Team Android here I will wait what Pixel 8 and 8pro brings
Hol up so at 053 you hold an iphone 15 in dark blue Or is it black that you are holding Because dark blue does look very nice D
I just want another mini  I hate big phones so much Any one else have recs for a smaller phone  even if it isnt apple lol
Just upgraded my iPhone 12 mini to an iPhone 13 mini
"Apple yrs ago we are removing the main button and common usb on the iPhone

Years later were bring back a button and common usb 



Jokes aside keep up the good work"
I enjoyed your videos as I always do Im getting the max 15 and cant decide between the white or the Natural since you got to see them in person which color did you like best 
why are they keep saying your name Mark as Brown Lee
Im seeing a Samsung ad between a iPhone review   Curious 
Getting one but torn between natural titanium and  blue titanium Whats your take
So my pixel 6a from early 2022 which has 31 USB C still blows the 15s out of the water with transfer speeds And with the Pixel 8s and their cutting edge Tensor 3 chipset now on the horizon as well its safe to say that Apples iphone has been finally outpaced and outclassed in every single aspect
USB port is the big thing Welcome to the 21st century
I can just keep my sony earbuds and charge it by keeping it on the back of my pixel device Thats pretty cool Not this IMO
"Make an Samsung Dex Mode  will replace low end Macs
Same time make an LaptopCase where u can put ur Phone as a Touchpad that powers a full keyboardlaptopscreen same time the Laptop has a Port to charge the Phone

Open the Store for sideloading"
The new design is the only thing they can fawn over USBC was implemented in the most apple way 
Time to buy iphone 14
I have an iPhone 12 and my wife has an 11 Should we upgrade to the 1515Pro
iphone  boring 
Iphone nowadays just produce names nothing special the only thing they produce in this phone is just USB charger and not even a fast charger
Were there any improvements to LIDAR or its app  That is the defacto input module for the Spatial Computer  Just wondering if its evolving
"Cant wait for Samsung to mock apple Theyll be like
Welcome to the Cside "
wow Apple just discovered USB C 
way overpriced no value
Cant wait to get one soon as the promax is ready I want one
Marques probably check off his bucket list yesterday be used as a reference for quality in a quote at the beginning of an Apple Event ie thats when you know youve made it hahah
Its Apple you are talking about They were forced to move to USBC and it is not surprising they would only do the bare minimum
What about the battery size Still the same 
Like charging your earpods from an iPhone is a new thing to the mobile world oh wait Android has it for years 
They took them lock switch away and gave you a Bixby button
Im so excited for the customizable button Ive been waiting forever for Samsung to get something like this
the iPhone 15 might be the most disappointing launch of any iPhone
But still no thunderbolt charging
For the usbc change you can thanks us form the EU cause if it wouldve been for apple we wouldve still had lightning for many years
I was waiting for the usbc version to update my 11 base model Finally arrived But Ill wait to see if I go pro max
I hope Apple didnt buy Marques with that mention in their event so that he doesnt speak honestly about them Also shoutout to Europe for fighting and winning over this greedy company A win for humanity
I cant wait to hear that the apple braided cables start unbraiding 
No Mini 
A terrific intro to the 15 lineup Thanks
Takeaway iPhone 14 with type c lmao
What amazes me in todays technology how HD everything is rn
sighhh
I think the craziest thing for me is that Apple did not raise the prices of the Pro models 
the phones look so cheap I think i might consider switching at iPhone 20 lol
iphone 13 pro max user just wondering if its worth it however i think for the cameras i will as i am a photographer and i like nice pictures etc USBC is nice as thats same as my Ipad Pro i skipped Iphone 14 promax as i think the difference was small but for those cameras i think it will be a jump over the 13 These yeary updates are getting smaller and smaller tbh
Yep  good job morques for putting an effort  making whole 13 min long  video when theirs nothing new to explain but needs to prize apple
Does the new button have settings where by  i  can  long press and switch to silent If i double tap it opens the flashlight and maybe if a i quick press it open something else
Im glad I survived to see USBC change 
Getting the 15 pro only because im still on the X and its getting noticeable slowlaggy
Im between iPhone 14 Pro vs iPhone 15 Its basically the same but 14 Pro has one camera more Thoughts guys Thanks
Basically the iPhone 14 but more expensive
As an iPhone 14 pro owner I think this iteration is about the smallest change weve seen There is basically no reason at all to go from 14 pro to 15 pro Even the camera stats are identical with the exception of some new camera features But same megapixel same everything
Oh boy still no fast charge in 2023 
Wow iPhone is so disappointing as usualwhat a crap again
Good review keep up the good work
Im curious about what Marques thinks the 22 interesting iPhones that came before the 15 are  If you count every iPhone released its over 35
future proof chip does not matter if you cant replace the battery
Cant wait to buy this phone in 5 years when it becomes affordable 
I dont like the action button the silent switch is great as a switch I can just peer at the side of my phone to see if it is silent or not The USB 3 feature is pretty scummy but glad to see USB C
Looks like Im keeping my iPhone 13 Pro Max another year Apple needs to find another froth driver I wish they would have put the iPads desktop experience on the iPhone
Should I get 14pro or 15 prod  Tech wise does 15 pro is worth vs 14pro
Let me guess Apples puppet said its the best phone ever and we should skip work and upgrade immediately
"I have the 13 pro and was thinking about upgrading to the 15 pro since there was rumours about type c and telephoto lens on the pro models 
But now that its confirmed type c wont be fast charging and 15 pro wont have the telephoto lens Ill skip this year and upgrade next year I know apple being apple will save fast charging for 16 series and maybe thunderbolt will be supported and telephoto will be added in 16 pro"
Im still on an iPhone 7  Just never wanted to upgrade because it always felt like hyped cash grabs  i just dont care about a damn high quality camera on a device designed for communication  but this and the apple watch are the first time ive actively wanted to upgrade and will be doing so
Apples Creativity is lost with the passing  of Mr Jobs 
S23 Ultra 200mp Camera enters the chat
"ehnot worth fo metoo little too late
maybe i will go for the iphone 18"
Ill keep my 14 pro
finally android and apple unite XD same charging port
Any news about new iPad mini  Should we wait or buy the currently one
I look forward to being convinced to pick one up
In less than a minute i lose interest technology its at its peak now nothing new nothing gaming change just all the same and Apple with an overpriced phone as per usual
Radiation levels have put a ban the new iPhone Apple has to release a software update to reduce power and radiation emissions
Im still on an iPhone 8 Plus This looks cool but surely I can just buy a iPhone 14 Pro Max cheaper now this releases and the difference doesnt look that drastic from the 14 to 15 as Im coming from an 8Plus everything will be a massive upgrade anyways
Im confused in 15 pro  pro max like should i get max for 5x zoom camera or i can go with 15 pro with a low price but im just nervous about the battery backup of iphone 15 pro
I can buy 2 androids and slam one to the ground without any regret because its still not waste of money
Weve made it to the point in smartphone technology that the most interestingexciting generational update is a programmable button
AAA gaming was the biggest improvement in my opinion
Wow I can finally let my friends use my 120W xiaomi charger 
The pro models are bleeding edge technology but do not get usb 4 I dont get it
What do you guys reckon would an iPhone 15 or 14 pro be a better choice in November this year
Its Apple so Im in camp dont care at all  When your headline feature is USBC it just makes me laugh
Ive been a diehard Android fan for years and this is actually going to be my first iPhone ever Im planning on going for the pro or pro Max So stoked to try it
Whats the rounded cutout on the right side bottom half for on the 15 Pro models
Ewaste rules the end of this video
What is the charge speed
ok so no 120hz no 1440p no emulation usb 20 speed I just dont understand why people support apple when android had better features 5 years ago for half the cost
"Tim  Here is the Iphone 15
Everyone It looks like the 14
Tim No it doesnt"
This phone is just not better overall than thr other iPhones You buy it because you have enough money to not because you want to upgrade
theres no sense in releasing an iPhone every year they should release one every two years this would be in line with the so famous recycling and durability of iPhones
Mute switch is gone that makes me sad
usbc congrats apple youre only about 5 years late
I never thought apple will get new products without the product red
The only improvement of latest iPhones is their profits margin They no longer bother developing they just change the model number and there you go 
I have an iPhone 12 pro max and my wife has an 11 pro were thinking about upgrading mainly for the 1000 our phone carrier will give us for our phones We cant really pass that deal up considering how old our phones are and who knows how much wed get next year if we waited Still a viable upgrade Id imagine What do you think Marques
Kind of weird how they didnt announce the smaller bezels
Buying an Apple iPhone is a waste of money
I went from a 6sPlus to the 14 Pro Max This isnt worth the upgrade yet Maybe by the iPhone 20 That should be a big enough milestone to upgrade to Besides they got rid of the Gold version so this year is an L for Apple
Still on my iphone 11 pro  waiting a few more years to upgrade
Not at alll
I watched to see how much waffle you would say to hype up the phone I see no reason to upgrade tbh
as a galaxy s22 user im definitely gettin that 15 pro max lol
Does the 15 base models have pro motion displays or is it still just for the top tier iphones
Im upgrading to the 14 Pro only because I really want a purple iPhone Someone else said ittake away the usbc and its literally the sequel to the 14
Apple at it again  Old ass features others phones have had for years and let me charge an arm and a leg for it 
Android has had that make portrait feature after taking the photo for years
its essentially a samsung phone with a apple wallpaper and logo it amazing how people buy the same iphone every year
I have forever been proudly an Android user myself and like you said before this event its almost all just stuff that Android has had for some time Even the ability to retroactively use portrait mode Ive had on my pixel for at least a year That said and Im not exactly sure why probably the really good aesthetics Im a sucker for anything with brushed titanium I think I may have to pick up the new 15 pro  I run dual sim in my pixel anyway so I guess I can just move one of them to that device and be a two phone person for a while 
FYI the pro model only supports faster data transfer due to the usb controller built into the new chipset
Not impressed at all
I actually prefer samsung  
Also dbrand just released their new ghost case for the 15 lineup and other phones They look so clean I preordered mine before I even ordered the phone itself 
your review is awesome  and cover every specs
Samsung did the portrait after shot thing back in 2019 with their s10 lineup now that I think of it you really cant be mad at Samsung for slowing down their S22  S23 Ultra cause if this is how far back Apple iswell that is a shame no offence to the die hards
No more does anyone have an i phone charger
Nice impressions there Im totally in the camp those who will change because iPhone 11 Pro Max is nearly out of plan for Apple to support in the next months But your video pointed out the 15 Plus may be the most suitable and less pricy for me thanks to the features except the 120Hz display from 14 Pro Max What do you think Marques 
Is the minimum focal length improved Its horrible on the 14 PM
Dont like the glass back Too easy to break
Fast charging take They dont want USBC to catch on They hate that they had to switch so they are speeding up the portless iPhone for a few years from now and MagSafe will be the only option
Ill be switching from Android to iPhone this year I was leaning Pro Max but now am seriously thinking of the standard Pro
Not supporting usb3 in the base phone just seems like they just found another way to say we dont care about what you want  I understand this is a new chip but they knew the usbc change was going to have to come because of legal reasons
Nah Ill keep using the SE 2020
I upgrade every 2 years went from 12pro to 14pro max Ill wait for the 1616pro
Youtube is amazing its an iPhone video watching on iPhone but ad is about z flip
Smh same bs Im good
Im trying to remember when Android phones all switched to USBC I know it was a while ago
Im in two camps camp dont care at all and camp getting it anyway for a tax write off Both camps disappointing
"Feel disappointed as they finally replace lightning with USBC but limit its potential to 15 and 15 plus And like what you mentioned in the video no faster charging speed 
Am using andriod phone and thinking to change to iphone this year but dont find 15 line up attractive Probably will check out the used market for better deal on 14 or 13 lineup  instead"
Everyone saying one cable like they forgot the existence of the apple watch
That pink makes me want to drink pomelo juice
The only reason they have USB C is because of Europes new rules
48MP chip
"For me even tho I am a power user and am a big tech person I have committed to being on a 2 year cycle for iPhone and a 3 year cycle for watches I am picking up the Ultra 2 coming from a gen 1 SE and I got the deep purple iPhone 14 Pro Max last year so 2024 Ill be grabbing that iPhone 16 Pro Max Ultra and then in 26 I will be going up and doing a duel upgrade for my watch and phone unless for some go awful reason I cave and get the 2025 watch or phone 

I over all have not been super interested in the features of maybe the last 5 years of the phones and the watches for that matter going from a SE to a Ultra is a massive jump and my SE shit out a few weeks ago and I have been taking full advantage of the 14 day return policy on the watch so I went and got a Ultra its great btw I have been just rinse and repeating watch buys and returns for a few weeks now since my SE basically goes from 100  15 after a 2 hour run lol"
Its not stronger  Stainless steel is stronger than Titanium and also stronger than aluminum which is whats inside the new models Ti is lighter than steel and stronger than aluminum
Ah yes Apples innovation at the finest Introducing old android phone features as a breakthrough
Did they color match the USB C bits Thats a nice touch
They have made it more repairable for them and no one else This is the same design that the regular 14 and 14 had which allows apple to pair the back glass to the phone meaning only Apple can replace it They glue the wireless charger and NFC reader to the back glass which de pair to the logic board ensuring that if you want either of those to function you need to replace it at apple 826
Sitting in an iPhone 12 right now im gonna upgrade to iPhone 15 and enjoy a lot of the new features  i change my iPhone every 4 or 3 years and it has been a great experience  value for me
Thanks to the EU Union for making USBC even possible Without them we probably wouldnt see the change for another 4 years
Thinking of going from my S21 Ultra to the 15 Pro max ive had my 21 ultra for 3 years now so thinking its time
My iphone 7 plus is crying
What the hell apple just showed iPhone 14 and now iPhone 15 instantly They are ripping peoples from money I mean one year newer iPhone and all the others start slowing down I think im gonna switch to Nokia with light
old wine in new bottle
It takes true bravery for Apple to give us a port from 2014 with the data transfer speeds from 2000 
Yawn  Apple is way overrated
I remember when Steve Jobs said we didnt want buttons Now here we are with another button
So basically EU 1 apple 0 otherwise same shit different year
This is literally just USB C
Only 2 things were preventing me from getting an iPhone the ui I prefer my 3 buttons but the biggest thing was having to carry around a different cable so idkkkk plotting a Lil bit now
I think the one thing that you didnt mention that really got my attention is the isolated phone call feature The work that I do am always around a lot of noise But I still might just wait until the 16 to upgrade
I was really looking forward to this iPhone but it seems like a pointless upgrade again I have a damaged charge port but I still might just wait till next year Wireless chargings been fine
The only thing i wantlike is the type c port Im never gonna have a problem looking for a charger when traveling just in case i forgot to bring mine
What background is on your screenshot
Finally noone asking for a lightning cable because their iPhone is constantly low on battery
Man thats so funny with you saying its just USBc because my wife was talking to a girl who had an iPhone and she was so angry that it was USB c
I like the fact that the pro has a thread radio Anyone catch that
Welp Hanging on to iPhone13 another year
Hey I want to get the iPhone 15 pro just for the camera and charger It would mean that I would only need one charger for my phone and MacBook I enjoyed the video Thanks for the content and hard work
Love them just cannot afford to keep upgrading In our country to make it affordable they are financed over 3 years
They dont release all they the things could for the next iphone they will give the base iphones USB 30 and for the pros thunderbolt
I saw this as someone whose color isnt pink but that pink looks awesome
Natural Titanium FOR THE W
I had a pair of Airpod maxes and I had to put another USB cable on my desk to charge them My other headphones were usbc and I was expecting the airpod max to have them too So I am glad I can now move away from their whack cables and just use one cable for everything
6E wifi is only on the pro version So Ill likely upgrade
"The most lackluster update to iphone weve ever seen The only things this years iphone has that my 14 pro doesnt have is the titanium finish action button usbc and ability to make photos portrait after taking them Thats literally it

Not to mention all the chargers weve accumulated over the years will be worthless now"
Unpopular opinion but The non pro iPhone is never going to get a high refresh rate screen Its always going to be 60 just because 75 of people cannot notice the difference between the displays
no chapters in the clip
Im still on the 13 pro max And I still dont see any reasons to upgrade yet
"I only interested in 2 things
1  Is it going to throttle like a b in a hot weather like my iPhone 12 promax does
2  is it going to get better reception comparatively to android phones"
Lame phone
There is no new future just redesign
The 14Pro looks a lot more delicious now since itll drop in price
Marques the phone internal storge speed is up to 1Gbps there is no need to give you thunderbolt 3 or 4 speed on the USB C
It was the first Apple event I turned off after 10 minutes So boring and so pointless Its actually got me thinking about switching to the dark side Apple not exciting anymore
Sign me up for the black 15 pro Though that blue is legit too
Apple done it again by innovating on the usb c
I keep hoping they will disable portrait mode for video
This will be a great upgrade from my 12 pro max in 3 years
Tim mentioned MKBHD Wow MKBHD is larger than life
Congratulations on being recognized in the keynote 
54 A2DP LE	 is the last one
"This is what damage control looks like  Hes saying a while bunch of nothing

Watch all these tech reviewers pretend like the design hasnt changed in 3 yrs but made such a big deal about the s23 ultra being the same design as s22 ultra"
Not getting one this year
i wanted them to release a pink pro but they only did pink in the base 15 and plus 
Nits is a logarithmic scale so saying 2000 nits is twice as bright is kind of right but theres more to the picture This is first impressions tho so we arent here for the cold hard facts
Its just not worth the upgrade  I hate its not innovative or creative It was very lackluster no wonder to it
So what I got out of this was the iPhone 15 and 15 plus is the same as the iPhone 14 pro as far as the hardware is concerned I would be better off if upgrading purchasing iPhone 14 pro with better camera than iPhone 15 or 15 plus
Im still running my rooted Samsung M20 with Android 13 custom rom Couldnt care less about the new iPhone lol
No Mini  I guess its for the best there is no cute cases for iPhone 13 Mini anyway Guess no one buys the minis 
I hate the new side button I dont need shortcuts Theres already so many the flashlight and camera are already on the Lock Screen Swipe down and tap dnd is the same as holding down that button
A bummer for the action button is that now we cant tell directly if the phone is silent just from the switch
E Marcus is the besti was proud when Tim Kuk said about yours opinion 
"Now a new iPhone mini and Im all on it
Perfect for a backup for my android phone
Sometimes you need a small screen to go out for a walk hicks or what not 
Oh not to forget cant wait for a REMOVABLE BATTERY iPhone "
worse usbc  worse bluetooth  no 8k  So many things from Android are mission  Ishit shite
I have been sticking with mine for 4 yrs  every feature seems new to me 
Honestly I dont see the point to upgrade iPhones except when Apple stops iOS upgrade support I have an XS Max since a few years and it still works perfectly fine Sure I had to change the battery but realistically what allows the iPhone 15 that my phone does not  I can make phone calls text take photos browse etc and this is what most people do Sure there is a few tweaks but its just a matter of triggering peoples compulsion to buy new things They are putting emphasis about zero emissions but if they were truly committed they would extend iOS support repairability etc not try to sell you a new iPhone that will be unnoticeably faster and now charge with usbc WoW incredible
054 is the black actually purple or more like the midnight color on the new MacBook Air
Its always funny when Apple finally does something everyone else has been already doing
Im buying this iPhone because mine is 11 pro max But I think Apple is becoming boring
I thought Apple showed braided USB TypeC cables in the iPhone promo videos Is no one talking about that
"still at 60hz and no real camera zoom  theyre sleeping  
The latest Iphone with 5 year old android tecnology is just hilarious"
I still have the XS Max so its time to upgrade this year
Fast Charging will come next year in the 16s that is what Apple do hold back basic functionality other phones have had for almost 10 years now and claim its worth a 400 upgrade Laughable
First phones just had number keys Then they had full keyboards then they took almost all the keys away and then they removed them almost entirely Now phones can do a million different things and everyone is losing it because they added ONE button back to do launch one of those millions of things Maybe Im missing something but it feels like a joke
Still not better than google Google will be the first to reach Jarvis status
buying for USBC dont  me
Your videography camera is awesome 
Whats the wallpaper on the thumbnail of the video 
Lame
The 15 PM I mean its not bad For an iPhone
Basic iPhone for the iPhone drones
Is it just me
Apple went from one of the most revolutionary tech products to the absolute bare minimum
The pro to just say faster charging might be the dumbest apple move yet but thats just my opinion The literally have an obsession over batterycharging for some reason Give people what it is800 minimum for a phone that charges as fast as an older phone is laughable but the even more laughable part is making it a focus on the chip itself lol I like that samsung screen though 
60 Hz  jesus
Usb c should be standard for every device should be a law
Stop paying over 500 for a phone
I think the normal 15 is quite interesting for nonpower user Very complete package that could last easily for 45 years
Review Mate 60 Too
Shoutout to United Polaris in the opening clips
My android curse me every time i watch an apple product 
basically apple has done nothing and made u a fool 
A grade 5 titanium design is something weve already seen a phone A 26 teraflop 3nm chip A customizable action button Please Marques point me to where weve seen this before
Hey buddy Im looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this My initial impression wasnt too exciting but Im hoping your indepth review will shed some more light on it
I got the first IPhone then I got the 7 I thought itll be funny if I just waited until the 14 I got the 14 pro max now Im waiting for the IPhone 21 lol Its a such a big jump in upgrades compared to getting a new one every year
Definitely in camp care but waiting to see if its worth getting the new one
LolMarques trying veeerryy hard to show ppl that apple didnt give consumers the same product with an updated usb port
Damn those cameras ugly
"The fact the biggest feature is something others have had for years feels like a let down This is coming from an Apple fan 

That being said the faster transfer is a big sell since I do a lot of videos and use it work work"
Im getting it mostly because its just tradition at this point
The 15 pro in my opinion was made for gaming  nothing else honestly with their name titanium vibe
how much apple pays you
Was an iPhone user since the og iPhone Switch to the 23 ultra I was hoping this phone would bring me back but nope still the same boring phone
"I 100 agree They should have aimed for at least 20GBps for data transfer I feel like Apple is throwing a fit 
what I imagine 
Apple I dont wanna put USB c in my phones
Europe you have to
Apple well fine but its going to be the worst possible So THERE"
Quit lying to yourselves it has the same boring design as the 11121314 Apples design innovation is dead Its now a money grab
Great review as always Its the same thing but different year Stick to your phones guys 
Does anyone really give a damn about new phone models anymore
Waiting for the Pixel 8 series
Just another launch
Marquees what do you think about 60hz displays I think you havent mencioned it I think is a SHAME
As a android user i can now say i have a IPhone charger  Friends be dammed when they come to visit i have a charger for youu
301 sensor
Im sure anytime a prominent tech tuber mentions batterycharging on an iPhone they pucker up a little lol
The chapter tags though  MORTAL KOMBAT
For me Usbc log and external recording are the best features
That means something when the CEO of Apple quotes a YouTuber Nice job MKBHD
Man I cant even defend iPhones anymore Im sure itll be an amazing device but damn
"Samsung already had that next generation portrait for over a year now no hate just a fact
In samsung gallery"
the hell  people are going to buy this because of weight reduction
I bought a Fold 5 cause Im just bored with apple Every year its the same our most innovative phone yet So you added new colors and upgraded the chip Everything that should be expected with a new phone OMG TITANIUM Its nice to make it out of titanium but the fact that they spent so much time talking about that acting like it makes it the best thing in the world was very pretentious Innovation at Apple died with Steve Jobs died
The only real difference for me is the usb C inclusion and the ability to charge other devices Everything else is what I consider a gimmick The dynamic island is cool but after a day you will forget about it The internals just arent different enough to justify an upgrade for me Mind you I have an iPhone 12 still
This is my upgrade year and Im more than pleased with the iPhone 15 Pro Snagging for sure
Good video Take note of how I stopped watching at 12 minutes though
1254 Prolly bc theres overlap between the normal 15s and the 15 Pro
Come to Islam dont use musical instruments haram Hadith 5590
"The ray tracing and massive gaming capability is good and bad at the same time Good from a technological point and BAD because I fear that the greedy companies might stop making games for PCconsole slowly and move to phones which is infamous for its blood thirsty microtransactions 
Its pretty clear that the industry has been trying to move to handheld devices for gaming for a long while now but them making another nintendo or Asus Rog or steamdeck is different than making phones that can run PC games because of its extremely customerunfriendly economy"
Why is it such a pleasure to watch your videos
Usb c lets go
They need to keep fast charging so they have something for next year  Introducing Magic Charge only on iPhone 16 Pro Ultra Max Plus
Its better I have so many friends at work that ask if I have an iPhone charger and Id have to tell them sorry I have a USB C Now they can use all Android chargers
"Its very disappointing that their headline feature USBC port was only introduced because of the EU regulations yet they act like theyre such heroes for a genius innovation that they kept for years because they wanted to make more profits off of proprietary cables
Edit I also have no idea how the geniuses at Apple couldnt integrate USB 30 into their base phone if the technology has been out for years"
Thats so upset was hoping I would upgrade my 13pro but maybe next year
I usually upgrade every year I think Im going to hold off this year USB C is nice but I havent used lightning to charge since the mag safe charger The titanium is also nice but I also use a case so whats the difference
"Apple says people now will be able to play AAA games on the new iPhone 
Funnily still none of the Macs can"
cant wait to get this phone im so happy that the iphone 15 camera is 05x 1x AND 2x
"USB C is not a voluntary change or something due to innovation but purely the result of the EU mandate for ALL mobile phones sold in the EU should have USB C charging ability 

So basically there is NO significant improvements andor anything really new other than some cosmetics and lift job"
Great review thanks Also I use exclusively Anker stuffgreat sponsor
Is David holding the new GFX 100 II
"The real question is does any of this matter  For Apple I would say a good 5070 of the buyers are just gonna get the new version no matter what  It could be the exact same phone  Another 2030 are folks on devices maybe 23 generations old and so just in need of an upgrade  I would say at best 10 are buying BECAUSE of any of these particular features

Maybe USBC will finally get some folks who were sick of Apple holding out since they finally were forced to change but I dont think itll be many  I would be fascinated to see a real study on this though since obviously the above is all subjective based on my experience with friendsfamily who have iPhones"
154 iPad 10th gen has USBC
Always upgrade every year and this is no different Already have my prepreorder set in the Apple store 1TB iPhone 15 Pro Max I literally use my devices to make a living so I need nothing to get in the way and their top models have been nothing short of fantastic for getting work done 
The really massive innovation will come with 2027s iPhones Itll be 20 year anniversary of iPhones and 5 years after iPhone 14s which changed its notch Apple makes major changes every 5 years It probably have under screen selfie camera and sensors according to famous leakers much better battery screen PPI OVER 600 PEAK BRIGHTNES  2500 144HZ Cameras 8k 60FPS recording over 100mp main camera and speakers So for me save your money wait 4 years and buy iPhone 19 Pro MaxUltra Probably 3000 by then
Dont care about iphone  iPhone 15  pro is 630 more expensive india  Pro Max is 650 more expensive Its not even an option at this range 
"People always ask do you really need the new one There is never a good reason for regular people to change their phone every year Its just dumb specially since they are never huge jumps 

Also I enjoy that the changes between the pro and pro max are usually camera something that I personally dont care and they really need to catch up the base phone to the market offering still 60hz on a 800 phone is criminal in 2023"
"Well my guess is Apples nonenthusiastic announcement for type C might be linked to all of the percentages and contracts that are surrounded by lightning Now Apple has to skim up new advanced technologies for type C to recover the losses
Sincerely iPhone promax 16"
I almost watched this whole video when I realized i have 30
iphone is way behind Huawei
Apple camera is bringing me Lytro camera vibes with the whole focus on things after the fact which is really cool too see
excited for uniform phone accessories
Lord that Dynamic Island is an eye sore
So its either still a mute switch OR an action button That seems annoying
I will be buying one leaning towards the 15 pro but only out of necessity Its time for me to upgrade from the iPhone 8 Id much rather run my devices into the ground than do frequent upgrades and the 8 is definitely feeling a little tired by now not to mention no more iOS updates Plus waiting this long between upgrades makes each upgrade feel much more substantial
The Apple Era of minuscule upgrades because they know youll be clamouring for whats new every year
I am still happy and rocking a 12 pro  I was hoping that there would be something that all but made me upgrade but there really isnt  Maybe next year
Slower charge is better makes you put down your phone and do something else
what really impress me FUJIFILM GFX100 II
Finally going to make the jump from  my XS Max to the 15 Pro max
The One Piece is reallllll
S20 FE to Iphone 15 pro or S24 ultra The perfrct upgrade
Ive had an iPhone X since it came out and I think its finally time to upgrade Thanks for the review MKBHD
Def not worth the upgrade from a 12 pro
iPhone 
Thank you for this pre review Always watch your videos very informational
Design looks dated
I am still not lending my samsung chargers to my friends with iphone I have seen them never returning others chargers
"Im an iPhone user who doesnt update very often  still on the XR which I got years after it came out

This is the first time Ive ever felt the need to get a new iphone Even just for USB itd be so nice to not have to have both lightning and USBC chargers around the place
That button looks pretty awesome too I dont use the mute switch leave it muted"
Seems like the same iPhone for last few iterations the only major change is the switch to USBC I was also disappointed the new apple watch 9 and ultra dont have a lot of changes either So if you have an iPhone 13 or 14 and a watch series 7 or 8 why upgrade
now I need to buy a C to A cable so I can use CarPlay 
I own 12 I will buy 16 when 17 will be launched
Thanks Marques It was great to see you quoted at the Apple keynote Hope you get some mileage out of that   Ive been waiting for the USBC port for a long time  So I going to upgrade my iPhone 14 pro max for that very reason  Been watching you for years love the content and your impeccable delivery  Cheers
I more exited to buy the Apple Watch 9  because in this device Im two year cicle Im moving to the same tile to the iPhone
Applemoney grab
This might finally be what takes me to the dark side My s22 is awful and my carrier is also getting worse Plus now I could use all my existing cables I may just do this
Man I just want them to make it easier to send pics from my PC to my iPhone Took me a half hour before I was so frustrated with iTunes that I just posted the pics onto discord and then downloaded them onto my phone Or uploaded them to google photos and downloaded
Thanks for the info Anker products are the best
I love the OnePlus alert slider rather than the iPhone switch or the new action button
Do you think theyll have a Spring event Perhaps they could offer vibrant colors at that one Like product red and forest green
So they are just going to leave out the fact we need a new headphone adapter for this
What in the world They have usb C phones that DONT support usb 3 Crazy
same phone every year 
Same phone nahhhh
I wanted to switch from Android to iPhone because they released pink version Its so pretty lmao
Who cares about the cord I want a good screen and colours
Its either something we have already seen in other phones for years or some eco system things that will only work with other iphones is the most biased statement you have ever made Titanium Dynamic island  Action button actually everything except TypeC is new but you just wanted to quote this to please android fanboys Not expected from you
Well looks like Im going to still rock the iPhone 12 Pro Max this year I mean I get it its hard to always innovate something like a phone but its just been so stagnant these past couple years The least they can do is make it look different
Not worth it
Typical Apple theyre still generations behind Android when it comes to fast charging and USB connectivity But Im sure everybodys gonna brag about the new port Same goes for the action button 
So its USBC now Wow my s20fe 5g has done that for 3 years now and faster than the iPhone wow apple Could at have least given it fast charging
Looking forward to your indepth review on the iPhone15 Pro Max
Damn no fast charging Thats why I was considering upgrading guess Ill wait till next year
48 MP chip is the craziest techwindow I guess
"I dont see any reason to buy this 
Apples everyyear release schedule is killing them They need to release every two or three years so we actually see some meaningful upgrades As it is announcing a new iPhone has become meh"
Funny when he says your friends android meaning he is not an android user
Apple is now dissapointing I see more things for big brother to use it againts us Apple feeds all of their info to the feds
Wow USB C but no fast charging they couldve at least given the pro models fast charging capabilities So I still have to wait 2 hours for a full iphone battery vs the Samsung S23 only having to wait about 40 minutes
You people into phones are hilarious
I think the action button is so stupid and let me explain why As a person that goes from Loud to silent on the daily activities I wouldnt want to take my iPhone every time I do that now Plus just in case your phone can accidentally push that button to go from silent to loud in a scenario which will suck I dont know We have to wait and see how this change will effect daily use
Love how he quickly glossed over still no reverse charging 
Type C  thanks to Europe
"USb 20 is a standard that released in the year 2000 23 years ago 23 It has been able to legally consume alcohol in the US for 2 years

There is also no  way it would cost them more than 50 cents on the BOM to go from USB 2 to 3  i understand the chipset doesnt have the controller so its not JUST the port spec itself but cmon you think that was an accident a chipset made in 2022 releasing in a 2023 product doesnt have usb 30 The freaking USB 5 spec was just announced this week Its true that it wont effect most people but it would effect me I like to physically back my  up still because downloading photos from icloud is a nightmare i guess that makes me a tech grandpa

action button cool probably going to be too limited to actually be useful bixby style but maybe some day Titanium alloy cool material changes are necessary get rid of that fragile glass crap please use that weird ceramicplastic that the pixel 3a had underrated

no fast charging still 20W cmooooooon please god move on Apple my oneplus 10t had 150w charging that didnt harm the battery because they smartly engineered around the problem instead of ignoring it outright

more repairable back glass GOOD it was an absolute nightmare before Now replace it with something less breakable thank you 



also base iphone is 830 now if you buy it unlocked you know buying the product outright instead of signing up for a contract to rent it for 2 years The price creep on all smartphones is ridiculous"

my gosh you had one chance to make the 15 mini at a reasonable price and you didnt i dont freakin get it
Can you remap the action button to launch google assistant app
Still no 4k screens
Finally usbc 
"I still have the target to buy the 14 Pro next year
And i will be really happy with it I am switching every 25  3 years and so far i am fine with this strategy"
when they going full wirelessmagsafe
MKBHD please do a deep dive on A17 chip pl cover all technical aspects Eagerly waiting 
I think its the best iPhone yet
You cant tell me Apple cant bring 1 single factory to the US and give Americans jobs Shame on you Apple
Punch hole is much better than dynamic Island Its looks ugly  People doing sacrifice about this
Apple is selling candies every year now
I think they named the chip 17 pro so that on iphone 16 and 16 plus they can use a non pro version So even next year the non pro version wont have the same chip as a pro version
I keep wondering what year it will be when the cupboard is truy bare but then I realised  until Apple cant be bothered changing the name or the ads and Tim does a prerecorded message from a day spa and they break all sales records anyway they have achieved nothing The ultimate goal still awaits
Sounds like a solid jump from my iPhone 7 Plus
Man These upgrades are pathetic Lol You are the best tech reviewer period and this was still boring Not on you  just this upgrade culture is sad
Please make a review video for fairphone 5 Will it be available in india  If yes for how much price  in rupees 
"Action button is just gimmicky period
No gold for promax No problem no mega upgrade for this year

No gold for series 9 watch no problem
No upgrade for this year"
Nothing interesting  just a new phone
Just get a samsung   apple folk your ideas ran out You cant see that not
Well yes but actually no  The thing about the typec connector in the new Iphone is its proprietary because apple is apple 
"The biggest disappointment for me was no mention of battery improvement According to reviews the 14 lineup was not better than the 13 line up It looks like the 15 line up wont be any different too Either itll be the same as the 14 or somewhere between better than 14 and worse than 13 But its a new phone it should have the best battery That was annoying No faster charging was a big disappointment too especially after almost every YouTube channel out there claimed that 35W charging was leaked when its still advertised at 20W that probably supports 27W 

The action button should have more options basically a double click option or even triple click option and also a hold option Not just hold or one click If they could add that with a future update that would immediately make the phone better But as of now anyone with a 12 pro max or newer doesnt really need this phone but I know even a 14 Pro max user will get this just because they feel the need to have a new phone every single year Im hoping there are big changes with the 16 pro max next year Starting with the dynamic island unless they get rid of that on the 17 pro max Also bigger battery faster charging and more options and customisable action button 

One thing thats bothered me ever since the first next generation iPhone came out with the iPhone X is that theyve never gone full 2k resolution with the screen like on the Samsung for example Thats a full quad HD screen but iPhone since the iPhone X to the iPhone 15 pro max have always been half way between 1080p and 2K I dont understand why Why not just go full 2K I hate that Ive never been able to watch 1440p videos on YouTube properly and always having to stick to 1080p because it doesnt fully support 1440p yet If a top YouTuber like Marques mentions this to Tim then maybe theyll add it to the 16 pro max or 17 pro max at the latest"
I guess Im in camp absolutely getting one
"Ill never understand people who are fooled into getting these uncreative  cheap and second rate products 
People are followers and are easily fooled"
We need better cooling
Should be the lowest selling iphone of all time
I have a thought what if 15s have usb 3 but they didnt say it to make the 10gbps on the Pros look that much more interesting
Iphone 12 pro Max to iphone 13 mini user here and I dont see the benefit of upgrading at all really Iphones have hit their peak and its all marketing bs now Paying more than 1000 for these sort of upgrades is actually absurd in my opinion
The biggest disappointment is that the regular iPhone 15  Plus  still have 60Hz screens These phones START at 950 and 1100 euro in Europe Samsung has 200 euro phones with 120Hz screens This is ridiculous coming from supposedly the leading smart phone maker 
I just would like to know if the 2000nits will make a difference in direct sunlight because the 12 Pro and 14 Pro are almost useless I understand the dimming feature a built in feature to prevent screen damage when it gets too hot But after only about 510min before you lose functionality
I dont understand the need for USBC Faster speeds how many people are really downloading things from their phone to their computer via corde
No one talking about why a 800 and 900 smartphone still have 60hz display in 2023
with the action button maybe if you make it do not disturb it can function in the island so you can tell its muted
Did you think the tie in of the 3d video in the iPhone 15 Pro Max plus increased iCloud storage and the tie in to Vision Pro was at all interesting
Titanium is NOT harder than steel Titanium is actually softer than steel Its just lighter than steel For the same volumesizeshape of material Steel is stronger harder more durable
Im in camp cant afford these but interested anyway
Wow
Im good with my 14 Pro Max Probably wont upgrade again til 16 or maybe even 17
So might as well just wait a few months for that fast charge version to come out huh
There wont be any excuse to not lend my charger anymore
Apple sellout
Honestly I still have my 12 Pro and dont see any real reason to upgrade other than the possible tradein offer which will also determine if Ill upgrade if its a good one My phone is in great condition somehow haha
Only if the fold 5 had done a better upgrade these phones would fail like stupid But now these pro phones will sell because fold 5 isnt a justified upgrade anymore
I still have a 10S and have been waiting for a reason to upgrade Honestly Ive been hoping for a thumbprint scanner for unlock that would have been a great addition to the new quick access button thingy
Marquees aint no way youre talking about the ray tracing like is something meh is literally the BIGGEST technology advance in decades in the phone market you can literally run a ps5seriesx game ON A PHONE 
Its so tragic that USBC is the only noteworthy feature and they even crippled That one feature Everyones excited and thunderbolt no fast charge no USB3 speeds  pro only good lord
Where can we donate all the lightning cables ugh
Thank you EU for forcing apple to use USBC
yeah its garbage The EXACT same design with a better chip a better camera and how following EU laws how excited Im not
Nope not for me I presume this will force next years upgrade into something more substantial Ill stick to the one I have
Switching to 15 Pro as first time iphone user lets see how it goes
My favorite announcements about the 15 Pro Max are the improved camera and the Action Button I can see so many uses for that button especially since they allow you to run Shortcuts with it 
Usb C should have been a thing on iphone 13
Not an Apple iPhone user but a great video nonetheless
if they Had Product RED I would buy it in a heartbeat but notso IM not
iPhone 11 4
"I begin to feel like the years of excitement for new release products are over Chinese brands try to be more and more innovative thankfully but most of established ones just play safer and saferits boring

I guess its what logically happened when you tru to accommodate shareholders and not innovation"
I have an iPhone 11 and its time for a new phone tired of this one Thinking about getting the 15 pro max
If you dont map the action button to mute will the mute toggle then be in control centre
definitely upgrading from the 12  im barely making it half a day now on my beloved mini
Its a cool phone but ill never use apple again I like my Samsung
Once again boring
I didnt like what most features iPhone keep in left top corner Like switchprogrammed button All interface have back button in left top corner what literally opposite to how we use phone  mostly with right bottom corner  I wish sometimes they fix it I feel like iPhone force me to use both hands to use smartphone
Here I am with an 11 pro max with a 78 battery I have to upgrade at this point The USBC and titanium are great improvements while Im confident the stupid dynamic pill will be gone in the next couple generations
This years unveiling was very underwhelming SMH So much hype for nothing Ill stay with my iPhone 13 Pro
Marques was right excitement category does go to Android
344 this feature first was on HTC one m8 I had one apple now says this is next gen 
Same  different year 
Titanium isnt stronger than stainless steel its more robust but actually softer so it scratches more easily but also lighter and feels nicer
My 14 pro is just fine 
Apple will always hold back for the next years phone obviously Iphone 16 pro thunderbolt and fast charging with wifi 7
Next year apple will introduce iast charging with unknown watt and call it 5x faster showing it in a graph 
This is the 3rd video Ive seen about the new iPhones A few good surprising things but mostly disappointing things is what hearing
The titanium should have just had a completely titanium back no glass That wouldve been dope
MKBHD did not say your android phone he said your friends Android phone
Nice beard
Marques Brownlee the biggest iSheep ever
Camp totally getting one
They will have fast charging for iPhone 16 so something new
Apple will never catch up to Android
Whats I like about MKBHD its always a well researched original polished focused and information Do you agree
Im still rocking the iPhone XS so it might be time for the switch soon 
I wonder which model will introduce the all new fingerprint sensor  big selling point
mkbhd I watched your every video from last 3 years but today I noticed something wrong with your voice in this video its sounds like some Robot 
"I just need to get an SE
Please send me one 
Miss my button"
Since iPhone 8 i never plug my iPhone into computer
Why no price different from 14 PRO to   15 PRO
Not changing from 13 pro Nothing that special for me Same for watch
"TBH the titanium alloy looks cheap af on video i hope its better irl 

We just got a new port and a new cpu thats all"
MY iPhone 12 Pro Max works perfectly fine No need to upgrade till they make a game changer iPhone
Still gonna hold onto my 13 Max
In typical Apple fashion Add a new thing or 2 that other phones have had for years and that iPhone users have wanted for years so then people like myself have to get it Hook line and sinker 
"Cmon Man how much can we really buy into this lie of upgrades when every year Apple keeps making the same phone and rebranding it with different stories 

MKBHD you of all people should know this"
Nothing innovative Ill continue to use my 13
Here they got a 500usd price bump  so for the basic standard iphone 15 its 1500usd I think Il be going for the google pixel 8 pro
USBC sucks That little tongue will break easily lightning port dont have that
USBC is only because of the EU Law dont overhype it
Im so interested in the new iphone but my money isnt 
I love you but im done with Apple Its got nothing we actually need in life Its gotten so much worse
"14PM to 15PM just not worth it Same screen same battery life I just cant justify spending 540 14PM trade in is 600 or so for the 15PM for these 3 things
1 Titanium
2 USBC
3 Action button
Waiting for the 16series"
Not enough to switch from Samsung
I currently have a pretty busted up iphone X should i upgrade and if so wich version should i buy
Cool how you mentioned that iphone 15 is still 60hz
"It was pretty funny to me to see Apple hype up USBC on the iPhone like it was something they wanted Like they didnt try to lobby the EU against the change It was also pretty hilarious to see them talk about USB 3 transfer speeds like it hasnt existed for more than a decade 

Keep in mind that USB 4 has existed for a few years now and Apple has been using Thunderbolt in their devices for a while In my opinion USB 3 on an 8001000 device should be the default"
Yeah its interesting to see USBC on iPhone but their keeping USB3 only on the Pro is a cheap move The cost difference between USB2 and USB3 is minimum compared to all other hardware
I care because I want a mini and now they are cheaper so this is great
Can you gift me iphone 11 please
It is amazing that you manage to hype up the same phone year after year
Waste of cash people stop buying same crap every year 
Apple is going to lose some money due to the lack of lightning cable sales I guess we all have to thank the EU for this USBC adoption
"Ill pass this one too iPhone 13 Pro is still going strong for me to justify shelling 1100 at this fed situation

Apple has to work little hard to get me shell my 1100 on them not enough appealing for me"
On the topic of thunderbolt speeds Its crazy that its basically their own tech and they wont include it in their pro devices My guess is that they would have to absorb they extea cost to not raise prices
The iphone 15 would be perfect if just the screen were 90hz at least 60 hz in 2023 just no
USB 3 speed aint 10gbps its 5 gbps
Wait Marques does not mention the iPhone tethering mode to Capture One and the video SSD recording
"The addition of action button with no customization

Ah they have to keep something for Iphone 16"
So in conclusion its the exact same thing
Well guess Ill just keep my iPhone 13 pro max
Thinkin my 13 promax is still more than capable
Miss the days when you could say Wow about new tech ecah year those were the days
"Damn the iPhone 15 Pro has a button AND you can choose what it does
Incredible gamechanging innovation
Im so over this"
Yeah Ill hang on to my IPhone 13 for a few more years 
"So basically they made it possible so that you dont have to update your iPhone at all this time unless youre one of those usbc people then you can pay full price for that port swap

Amazing Innovation at its finest 
Its okay to skip this one then It seems like purely a malicious compliance release a real flip off to the EU"
"Take it from someone who genuinely considered getting the 15 Pro if it was worthwhile after being years on OnePlus and Samsungs and why I wont be switching
1 15 Pro has NOTHING that significant of a changeadvantage over the 14 Pro 
2 14 Pro is a better deal right now however given how badly the 13 series was affected with green screens over the past 2 years and how the 14 series has been affected the past month already especially in the Asian region Ill stick it out"
Why would you want the fast charging tho the slower it charges the longer the batteries actual life is my phones battery is still at 99 life and i only use the iphone 5 brick and i have another iphone that i only use the 15watt charger and the battery life is all the way down to 67 so yes it is bad and i have tested this on a lot of phones and different types of batteries they all react pretty close to the same with over fast charging your battery
Why is the USBC standard not the same on both models 
"I enjoy tech So altho I dislike the UI of the iPhone I always intently keep my eye on Apples latest and greatest 

I think this is mainly because of their hardware prowess Specifically their processors I always hold out hope that theyll leverage the power and not just talk about it of their chip by doing stuff the competition cant Not just proprietaryecosystem stuff 

But no they dont Its 2023 and were still talking about 20 watt charging to say the least 

Give me an iPhone from 5yrs ago and the learning curve is almost zero And the new iPhones are marginally faster considering the numbers Apple puts out 

Apart from selling it if you gave me the option between getting a free Pixel 7a or an iPhone any Ill genuinely take the Pixel phone

I mean Im not in their ecosystem so its an easy call for me"
Really wish they did something revolutionary for the 15th iPhone Seems like just a material and camera upgrade
Yup Im due for a new one Biggest pull for me is USB C Dont want to have to carry so many different cords
only apple can make a big deal about including one of the most standard features in phones and then not give its full capabilities
Gonna upgrade from the iPhone pro max 13
"The default focal length makes a lot more sense than people not familiar with photography might think 35mm is a really standard prime focal length and I think its great to default to that natural looking focal length instead of a wide angle like a 24mm

Im excited for phones to start talking about focal length in terms of actual mm of focal length instead of 12x because that 12x is always 12x what 

Im not an iPhone person but that is one of those trends only Apple will be able to start in the phone photography world"
"Was kind of hoping they would sneak a mini back into the lineupdo the same sizes for regular and pro mini standard and plus I still think a lot of business class peoplethe people who might actually benefit from the pro model would pick the mini but didnt get the 12 or 13 mini because it was marketed as basically the budget option if you didnt want the SE if you spend a lot of time on planes or walking between rooms for meetings a small phone is a benefit Add in an iPad Pro and you dont need this giant phone Phonewatch becomes quick notification and action machine and the iPad becomes portable workstation Or a MacBook if you need it 

Maybe the next SE will be a mini but I kind of doubt it"
"It is still not clear if the base 15s have high refresh rate Nobody is talking about it I do not understand why

Apple was so sneaky with the words they used in their events No mention at all Its 2023 yall"
Im moving to the US soon Should I switch from my beloved Samsung Android to sn iPhone
Using the big brick to charge my iPhone 13 Pro last year made my battery life drop all way to 77 max health My friends XR has better battery health
"The usb c thing is just apple being  greedy it should be on the phones a long time ago
The rest small upgrades so 
Yes its a good phone but is always hard to justify the price when compared to everything else out there"
There you have it Apple is copying Android again and this time via USBC
Not upgrading my iPhone but will be upgrading my watch SE first gen to series 9
20 plus phone and only five are different lol
"What The new ActionButton is Your new favorite Really Im MORE THAN DISAPPOINTED because apple only assigned 1 function
If You compare it with the ASSISTIVETOUCH although its not the same but still there are max 8 programmable functions that are around it plus 3 single tap double tap and long press are a total of 11 functions 
I guess it would have been feasible to assign MORE THAN JUST 1 FUNCTION"
Totally want the new iphone but here in the middle east will cost a fortune and not everyone can get into the instalment program 
I am in the switching back to android camp Ill miss my ecosystem
Theyre holding back on fast charging so they have a headlining feature for next year
Am I the only one who is sad the mute switch is going away I like the tactile feel of a real switch
Release date
Why no music
Iphone looks so dated
I want it
MKBHD IS NOT HAPPY FOR THIS NEW IPHONE
"Upgrade from 14 pro max to 15 pro max
1 New processor 3nm
2 New GPU 6 graphic cores
3 New ios 17
4 New Usb typec display port
5 New RAM 8gb
5 New Titanium body 
6 New 5x optical zoom with 3D optical image stability sensor

And this is all NEW iPhone 15 pro max "
USBC is just because EU regulations forced Apple to it since starting in 2025 all devices in the EU must use USBC cables So if they didnt add it they wouldnt be able to sell their devices in the EU
Spatial video
Seems like if Im gonna get one of these I should just go with a pro model for better future proofing Just need to hold them in person now to decide which size is better for me
itching ear at 721
I would love to see the square camera bump on the back disappear Others have bar Google or round camera bumps Apple should make room in the body and recess the camera that sticks out the back that makes the phone rock when laid flat on a surface No real innovation going on in the past years other than software dynamic island 
Ligting is an big innovative Simple friendly and long lifetime  Can iphone make it more powerful than type C I dont like tipe C designs is same like micro usb Tive C Its a bulhist innovative on design
"After Steve Jobs Apples evolution was with the steps of a turtle
I dont understand why they keep time and what exactly are the interests for which they dont move as they could"
Its just usb c and camera nothing more like a 14s Im disappointed really
Im glad they finally did it but its basically the same iphone with thr minor iterations with a port that was forced opon them but still doesnt get full speeds charging and data rates even on the pro are well below the limits of the port I was hoping for more i guess
"You are my trusted source for tech review I refuse to buy Apple products but strangely still find myself watching your videos 
Great review Im waiting on the new Pixel to drop Cant wait to see what you think"
"Serious question about the chip in the phone
I assume they used the N3 node for the A17 chips which is why we see a small improvement between this chip and the previous A16  Heres my question though Do you think that theyll wait to actually release the M3 chipset when they can use the N3B format starting next year obviously for the different computing devices or do an OctNov event If they did the later who thinks the M3 pro and max chips would be using the N3E format since it would be available next year"
EVERYBODY USES THE SAME CORD NOW thats big to me I have a friend group that has phones across the spectrum Now I dont have to have 2 different cords so everybodys covered
Its crazy how marques makes millions of dollars and flew south west lol very humble
Why didnt you mention 60Hz on the base model
Ill upgrade simply because verizon basically pays for it with trade in Im paying like 7 a month for the newest phone Upgrading from 13 pro max
What it seems is that the capability of reverse wireless charging seems possible because on the iPhone with the MagSafe battery from Apple when you plug in your phone to charge your phone it reverse wireless charges into the MagSafe battery as well so I would think its only a matter of a couple software updates away before we get reverse wireless charging
Only left is the apple mouse to use usbc
"In my opinion Marques missed one of the biggest things with the iPhone 15 Pro Max Thats its ability to record Prores Log to an external recorder This is a GAME changer for those who are in the video world

This means that we will be able to record and not use valuable space on the phone and instead go straight to storage This will significantly speed up workflow and it will allow people to shoot MUCH longer takes with higher quality 

I am excited to see how its all going to turn out 

Great video "
"Apple quoting MKBHD

MKBHD I said it but never thought it lolololol"
Apple is so late its just a USBC port this isnt a big deal lol all other manufacturers have been using this for years
Its the same phone again The Apple ecosystem is the only thing keeping me from bouncing and getting a Fold So tired of this BS from Apple 
after the twelve the features arent worth it
this phone is a joke
Fast charge will be a new feature for IPhone 16
Pricing  trade in  value doesnt make it worth trading in my Apple Watch Ultra or 14 pro max like last year when they came out you can get a 14 Pro Max and trade in your 13 Pro Max for 720 and this year its only 650 I get they have to make money but thats crazy as well as 380 for an Apple Watch Ultra tradein doesnt make it worth it
Alright guys we have USBC Till next time
My question is for the iPhone 15 pro max for it to start with the 256g how many gigs is the phone taking up fresh upon purchase
Apart from the silent switch Which I love about the IPhone Everything is good I will miss the switch
Im actually considering to try the iphone now that its usbc
I havent quite heard anything about battery
I still have the iPhone 12 but I have new accessories that use the usb c Im glad to use one cord again and cant wait to get the new phone I was waiting on your review 
yesss i was waiting for Arun and Marques to reveiw these
The phone shape sucks they need to update it already
60 hz I love it 
If people dont know you can actually do that portrait mode on other phones as well Its just not labeled as a feature
Im in the mid My last upgrade was from XS max to 14pro max current phone and I definitely appreciated the new features Looking forward to your more in depth review of the 15pro max
Honestly I just hope Apple makes USBC accessories and redesigns them at the same time The Magic Mouse has been the same for eight years now come on Apple
I just hate that Apple killed the mute switch
Why would they compare their A7 to a high end PC gaming  What a reach Its not 1440p and a tiny form factor would make it get hot really quick Doesnt matter how optimized the chip is It needs proper cooling Plus the cloud gaming deal is just not entirely there yet Lags and fps are trash Just present it as a phone that occasionally play cloud games its not PC gaming 
They will use fast charging as a feature in their next launch need something 
With your celebrity power please just tell your followers that Apple sucks making iPhone because they are behind all the cool technologies already
USB c does is not exciting foe me Its the titanium I have a 12P I skipped on the 13 and 14 pros because of the weight I think I will love having the newest camera and a lighter phone
"Im still on the fence about the new versions phone and watch 
This was a very helpful video though Ill wait for the full reviews to see what they are like in day to day usage"
Wifi 6E was a good thing to see also
"Whats the point of future proofing when the battery wont last people just prefer to replace a 3 year old phone than its battery
The only stevejobsgrade Apple thing from the entire event was the finger double click for the watch  who ever thought of that at Apple needs a raise and she needs to be protected at all costs"
Really disappointed that theres no Metallic Red Color on the iphone 15 pro
I went to a Samsung event and Fold5 is really ridiculous Now that feels like an upgrade A USB C without fast charging is a joke
Sticking with 14 pro max  Apples 650 trade for a 1tb 14 pro max seems kinda low  shouldnt have to sign a 36 mo agreement to get 1000 off at a carrier  Samsung gives 1000 for outright purchase and trade for flagship devices  Im going to chill with 14 Pro Max
When will it be released
lol that should be called innovation or 
guess Im waiting for the iPhone 16
Upgrading from iPhone 11 I think its justifiable
I have an Iphone 12 pro and the 15 is a definite upgrade for me
The fact that Apple makes a special superstrong titanium iPhone is a gimmick when they still have glass backs It proves they build iPhones for service not durability
Marques is one of the best YouTube content creators 
"Im almost sad we are going to USB C Its such a pain to find the right chargers and cables for our laptops and other devices

And when we did have Android the USB Cs break faster with abuse

A step forward a step back"
Btw im disappointed to see the Gucci xbox was sold on ebay with your name on it
I got an 12
You forgot to mention the camera that shoots video for the Vision Pro I wasnt really into the 15 tell they talking about that as I plan on getting the vision pro when it comes out
I love how MKDHD says a slighly better display VS apple event saying the newest bestest display ever
A customized side button No What Where have we seen this before 
I was waiting for this
What do think being quoted by Tim Cook in the presentation 
Hahaha 20 watt charge whit usb c wtf   
"I have a 14 Pro Max and honestly I dont think is worth upgrading I will wait until iPhone 17 
If you want to buy Apple stuff buy newer Macs"
I would like a discussion about the fact that only the PRO version receives the chip update I think its wrong and dishonest
I dont see the point in upgrading from a iPhone 14 to iPhone 15 Maybe wait a couple a years and upgrade to iPhone 18
so nothing innovative or significant changes made compared to last years phone as always Or adding the things android had for years Apple does it again
Wonder why recording to external storage 4K60 video recording and support for the Academy Color Encoding System werent mentioned for the iPhone Pro 15  truly PRO features actually
Watching this on my Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 thinking how boring iPhone is  android has had USB C for at least 4 years and iPhone still no fast charging
"I am that 12x kinda guy Im always between 12 to 15 Use those a lot 

Usbc is okay More convenient to use external storage or accessories Was looking for faster charging Maybe 30w or 50w Faster magsafe with a cooler to about 30w 

I do like portrait after the fact mode and focal plane adjustments Just wondering if you edit to portrait does it tone map down from dolby vision stills to plain hdr Oh yes 24mp default size is nice And 48 heif Dont have to resort to shortcuts"
As always this is the channel I wait for opinions on the Apple releases
For someone coming from using the iPhone 14 Pro Max the biggest scam in the mobile phone industry is clearly Apple Every single year they add some tiny features people gloss over and then jack up the price These features other than the USB type C can easily be introduced in newer models through an update but I guess they have to milk people How none of the 15 variants including the Pro and the Pro Max doesnt have fast charging for a USBC is ridiculous In an age and time when even brands like Xiaomi have that feature it is wild to think Apple falling back to the USBC will deliberately omit the fast charging feature Not impressed at all
What I see is same old shit in new green carbon free cover 
Nothing new here folks Get back to work
What a purpose of life 
BxActions
23rd iPhone smoking crack I guess
"Hey man you think we will ever get a new iMac Growing up that was always the most beautiful PC on the market to me I finally got my hands on an old 27 when M1 made the price come down but I really really want to get a current generation one Any hopes for a big iMac with pro and ultra chips

On the topic of USBC I think some of the accessories will get a full replacement We are due for a Magic Trackpad 3 fingers crossed for Apple Pencil support Handwritten notes on desktop notes sounds amazing 

I think AirPods Max will slowly be forgotten about by Apple The were I a weird middle ground where if you care enough about sound quality to spend that much you can spend less and get more and they are to expensive to get just because you are an Apple fan at lease for most people 

I love them because the convenience factor but that is something you can also get with AirPods Pro I will say this though add a tube amp and the special 3mm to lightning cable and sheesh they are great headphones"
aww apple finally copied the Bixby button
titanium isnt stronger than steel
Im in camp Android and Im laughing hard
I just dont want to see a next gen Magic Mouse with usb C with the port exactly below the mouse 
Nothing new i love apple but
im more excited about getting rid of the silent mode switch personally but nothing worth upgrading for Nowadays I see these announcements just to see what new things will be on my phone in 7 years when my current one finally dies
I can finally get rid of my iPhone 7
TypeC is lol  coz its not a universal typeC 
I love my Pixel 7 Pro Should I buy the new iPhone Friday morning or wait
Not worth switching from my IPhone 14 pro max  Exactly the same features beside USBc and action button   Apple
These apple events are hilarious now They have a whole event for about 2 or 3 features
Series 40 cards are magically 60 better than before There has to be a reason to buyso stupid how we are being choked
Im going to be upgrading my 12 Pro Max to the 15 Pro Max Seems I picked a solid year to upgrade with USBC especially
It has actual real USB C this is the first time in my life im actually considering buying an iphone
Nokia G42 5G in PNK only for 179
Not just usbc yeah u right its usbc and a button
So considering the 128 GB base pro model would we now be able to easily move photos into a SSD now that it has USB c 
Saw a video today about kilobytes of memory modules used by Saturn V rocket computers
Still playing catch up with Android
USB 20 on the base iPhones and no fast charging Is Apple insane USB 20 came out in the year 2000 Its 2023
cool now I have to buy a fucking usbc cable
The most innovative smartphone everrrrrr 
So the polite way to say NO i have an iphone when someone ask for charger is gone
xr to 15 pro
"Omg USB 2 Speed No fast charging
Thats just hilarious in 2023"
Do you always have to long press the action button to do the action Does a short press do anything Seems like that should be programmable
was also still hearing that they were going to try and limit their devices to bloody USB 20 speeds unless you shell out the money for the pro model which so people dont have to look it up that means a maximum of 480 megabits per second which is what most people call a slow internet connection nowadays let alone a physical data transfer connection like that were pretty much everything else is capable of double that at least if not more
I am sure they will have to change the entire lineup of Apple devices to USBC before the end of 2024 as they wont be able to sell in Europe if they dont
Who is using the ubs c port to transfer data
Im in the camp of finally I can do that upgrade I was holding off on but maybe next year when they actually have some cool or exciting new features besides just a port
The button on the side is not worth the price jump
The explanation for USBC is simple the EU forced it I was laughing when they explained how cool is it
"love your review but we are not impressed with the new iPhone 15 
Maybe EU can force Apple to have removable battery again "
I feel like Marques has been bought out by Apple He used to criticize about Apple product Nowhere in this video hes talking negative about the new iPhone 15 and how the developers demonstrated This is odd and skeptical not a normal behavior of Marques Brownlee
"hoping to get the baseline 15
waiting to see the review before purchase tho
currently have the baseline 11"
I see users with the Pro accidently turning off the silence button if it is set for that  Hard to do with the old button
Marquee didnt list everything new about the iPhone 1515 pro btw You also cant expect to get all the specs of a pro in the base model Hence why one is a pro and one is a base  But one thing for sure is that the base model has a lot of new features for a base model Give Apple more credit this year man It was more than just usb c this year 
Wait The 10th gen cheap iPad already has USBC 155
Apple made us all buy usb bricks in the name of environment and now again we will be stuck with partial usb and lightning cable ecosystem They should have implemented usb c when they got rid of power bricks from boxes And say to the world migrate to apple world with your android chargers 
"No innovation at all unfortunately
 USBC standard hardware that has been around a long time now
 Telephoto lens cool but again just a hardware change
 Upgraded chip no duh slightly faster phone now cool
 Action button could be cool but Im sure the software will be just restrictive enough that you cant really do anything useful with it

Would have loved to see some bigger software updates to bring more customization and also would like to see them do more in the AI space Siri could actually be useful if they would invest in it and that would 100 get me to buy a new iPhone if it actually had noticeable changes But for now cool I guess we can charge our iPhone the same way weve been charging literally everything else for years already Thanks Apple"
Finally qualify for a upgrade from a 12 pro so I think I should do this one
Just seems like they are playing catch up each year
"At least give 50W charging capability to the Pro model or full blown TB4
Apple once again missed the opportunity of USBC smh"
1319 Jordyn Edmonds  Wrap Around Me
I thought you would be able to note that because it is a lot lighter as titanium when dropping it would greatly reduce the chances of breaking that glass or even getting less dents so it does in fact  make it a lot more durable just by having that material change
amazing now everyone will have a charger for my android
"The headline Not just USBC
Marques in the video Pretty much just USBC"
So a iPhone android Ill just stick with the phones I got Note 20 and iPhone 11
So no double tap  long press on the Action Button That is kinda of a bummer
My last iphone was the 7 getting 15 pro max doesnt sound to bad at all
Sir I can not afford anything shown in this video and am still watching it 
Why Action Button settings cannot be VOICE ACTIVATED as well for more spontaneous and adaptive situational settings And how if it can be
"Im in Camp dont care to switch from iPhone 13 to 15
The only users who should switch to an iPhone 15 is those have the iPhone 12 and under 
Once again they give you something new but it doesnt come with its full potential
They give you USB C but for the lower models you get 20 for the Pro you get 30 but not fast charging  We may have to wait till the iPhone 17 before you will see the full potential of USB C"
ngl Im upgrading from my 12 pro max because of usb c Now I can carry just a handful of type c cables to charge up whatever device I happen to be using regardless of who makes it
i guess people dont realize NEW phones are for NEW customers its not  fault that YOU have to have a new phone EVERY year What kind of new things did yall think would be on the phone
I believe you can change the focal length number in the top right corner in the camera app rather than having to go into the settings on the iPhone They gave you a shoutout broski 
This is by far rhe biggest improvement Apple has made since the X
They are saving fast charging for 16 They always need old features to repackage for new launches
So heres the lens to look at all this stuff through  proceeds to show us lenses 
Im neither in camp getting or dont care Sticking with android but I love to see iPhone go in the right direction
bring back will it bend 
im so tempted to get one iphone 15 pro right now but i cant let go of my OnePlus 11 because charging is still faster on my OnePlus device but the iphone 15 pro is a good thing to think about buying no doubt about that Ill think about it i wish they bumped up the charging speed tbh since they have type c already i wonder if iphone 15 pro can play max settings on diablo immortal and how long would it last in gaming straight
New touch button is top feature 
15 is compelling
People always talk about how whatever new feature an iPhone has android has had for ages Well Im an iPhone user so its new to me
iPhone gets a Bixby button
Weak Fast Charging
I love your videos MKBHD but Im going to go blast mode a bit Yes I want Apple to move to a USBC but the whole online tirade about how long it took is just Apple whiners whining because the internet which my generation made for you whiners enables you to do It takes a lot of moving parts on a whole spectrum of technical and nontechnical realities of running a business to move from one standard to another But most of us are so accustomed to buy and throw we are all constantly disappointed because shit is always better in the other pasture
Same shit different toilet
Ok so an iPhone 14 with a new port 
The icon not will be change and control center
What could Apple possible do absolutely nothing  since the iPhone X
Ive had a Iphone 7 plus since release and I think its time for me to upgrade to the 15 pro max
I feel that the IPhone is just doing what has always had like they used to lunch the IPhone 6 and next year was the 6s not much improvements between them until they lunch the 7 now they just dont called it 14pro s but jut just 15pro between the 12pro and the 13pro also didnt saw much difference until the 14 so I am happy with my 14pro and Ill wait to see what they lunch next year
Who needs these USB C transfer speeds tho Dont tell me people render huge video files on their iPhone lmao
Is no one going to talk about the base iPhone 15 being 60Hz
Still no option to remove the flashlight and camera buttons from the Lock Screen Come on Apple its been a 1 complaint for years
A 5x lens just now has me imagining that 3x49x are going to look absolutely awful Pretty disappointing because I use around 3x all the time With being farther away will the 5x lens kick in less if its not getting enough light
Nice now theres only about six or seven massive flaws with iPhones I will be in line once they are fixed
I think Ill get one Pro max But its more of a need then anything else Running on a s10 atm 
Some of us want a Mini Pro Successor to the Mini 13 Just a better camera really Same small size
Im getting the pro Max for the camera for sure
currently owning an iphone XS MAX i been waiting for long to find a reason to upgradei was certain to go for te 14 pro last year but it did not really impress me much thus i decided to wait for another year trying to push with my XS for the 15 but yet again it feels like its not worth the upgrade at all as the 15 feels more like a 14S and im kinda having a doubt that 16 will be the real deal which i dont like to put myself in this awkward situation where i get 15 and next year i regret not waiting and at the same time it would be a waste to get the 16can you guys help me decide i noticed my XS getting slower and laggy but should i try to push it one more year or just upgrade to the 15 pro
Not a HUGE tech person but does this mean I can now transfer files from my USBC iPhone to my external hard drive that also uses USBC
My iPad M1 Pro has been great with the USBC port Its silly that the iPhone and airpods had to wait this long to get it
Keeping my iPhone 12 mini until it dies Will continue buying AAPL stock 
You forget how much money these YouTubers have until you see them flying in the pods
yea Ill get one but Im really going to miss that nononsense toggle switch on the side It really does feel like theyre taking some control away I liked having a simple button with a dedicated feature When Im in a movie church meeting drs appointment it comes in handy Software can fail The switch is idiot proof
we going now in 2024 and seriously still at 20W25W charging lmao if this is the case then its just pure BS they just change the shape of the charging port xD
Still basically iphone12 with modificationscreativity innovations at apple died long ago
I still think that baseline iPhones having 60Hz screens is criminal In my country a 14 Pro is literally 1500 dollars and we earn much less than people in the USA which makes it off the limits for me This is what skewed me this year to replace my iPhone for a Samsung I miss some stuff but I love how smooth the screen is
the new future is not usb c its just the shape of it
60hz refresh rate for the iphone 15 with the 4 years old design  BWHAHA  You have to be a sheep to part with your money for this one
iPhone Yesterdays technology at tomorrows prices
Why the glass back still the biggest failure point of the devices and incredibly expensive to fixconspiracy theory is its on purpose so they can but devices back cheap and recycle hardware and sell as used devices making them more money
Tbf Im prolly going to keep my iPhone 13 for a few more years but its cool to see what iPhones are worth getting refurbished
This is why I update my iPhone every three years When you do so you see a SIGNIFICATE bump I truly believe if Apple wants to make a stand on global recycling and carbon footprint they will stop the yearly recycle and go with a three year or twoyear cycle
Fast charging is not as good a feature as everyone seems to make it out to be It deteriorates your batteries so much faster than normal slow charging
I tend to find the faster the fast charge the quicker the battery drain is it just me
"153 the baseline cheap iPad 10th gen already has USB C
At this point almost the entire lineup is now USB C"
Its absolutely insane that they are putting straight up console games onto the iPhone When RE4 remake released earlier this year I never imagined that it would release on mobile and certainly not in the same yearyear after Also releasing are RE Village and Death Stranding Im excited to see Digital Foundries videos on their performance
Why not talk about shooting in LOG colorspace
i loved lighting port  usb c often breaks from the inside  sad they had to accept this
I watched the event and it was nice to see them quoting you MKBHD it felt good
Hello Marques I have a suggestion on a new set of topics you can touch Safest cloud storage comparisons pros and cons prices etc
Thats what happens when you design proprietary stuff once you stop using it or discontinue it everything before that becomes obsolete
Stainless steel is stronger than Titanium so I dont know why people are claiming the new titanium rails would be stronger unless its physically a larger chassis underneath the glass
the USB C is the probably the greatest consumer win against corporate in recent history otherwise up until now we were basically slaves to these corporations and had no say in what we want they basically held us captive and we had to just get what they give im not a huge apple fan even though i have an iphone bu honestly its sad that people like mkbhd or other youtubers are not talking about this huge W that we just got this should be the biggest highlight of this years iphone 15 release this could be a turning point for all corporations and i hope america also grows balls like europe and starts tackling these corporations and their greedy tactics but i guess its hard in america since all these big corporations have all the politicians in america by their balls
Im switching to the 15 pro from a pixel 5 I hope its the right decision
Its like watching a rerun from last year saying the same thing over and over again Our most powerful process ever 10 faster than last year bigger battery using the exact terminology and damn everyone still gets excited for it
Im in Camp dont care Apple could try to really knock our socks off and they didnt Personally I LIKE the lightning charger It just feels like more solid of a connection than USBC cables generally do I dont do any data transfer so that makes no difference Ill keep my 14 Pro Max for another year maybe theyll do something exciting in 2024
Thank Eu regulators for that USB C
Why is iPhones a flex again It being lightyears behind android
The Google pixel does a lot of these things
654 noone cares what the rails are  999 of people are gonna whack on a bloody great case immediately to protect if in case of an accident
So the action button is like a double tap on the back in Pixels
Ive been on the fold 3 for 2 years now The most appealing thing about iPhone is its ecosystem and video I think if I was going to get the 15 I would want the 15 pro max but in the 15 green
Disappointed  Nothing else Nothing against the MKBHD but Apple Its never gonna be a game changer I phone 7 was my last I phone and liked I phone XR but hate the rest Rip Apple
No offense i will just stick to my iPhone 14 pro for the now
Same difference
Glad to see USBC but this feels like another skip for me Went from the 12 Pro to the 14 Pro so I feel like its safe to wait for the 16 Pro
Thank you EU for forcing Apple to get rid of that silly proprietary cable  Looking forward to 2025 when Apple will be forced to give us an easily replaceable battery
USBC One cable to rule them all
Im a Pixel user but its always interesting to see what Apple is releasing
Is there actually any realworld reason to not include the USB 3 instructor on the base models
Looks the exact same as my 14 pro only difference I can see is the pusher button and the A17 bionic chip as well as the phone being titanium instead of aluminium
the inside of type c its colored too 
Just a phone peoplego outside
I still have my 12mini 
Isnot it becoming boring
Im in camp due for upgrade because I still have iphone X But Im disapointed overall Yes the new phone will be faster and the camera is the best ever when is it not  But there no wow I couldnt do that with my current phone meaningful feature
626 its a huge opportunity for apple to wait for IPhone 16 Pro all new fast charging
1st world problemshaving to wait an hour or so to charge your phone lol we spoilt
Boring Get a Flip 5
Yet no iPhone Fold
Stockholm syndrome
15 Pro Max Here I Coome
How do you go from 480 mb to 10 gb Thats ridiculous they should all support usb 3 Im glad Im team Samsung Is anyone with the s23 ultra Im looking forward to the s24
Of course its usb c 20 that way they can upgrade it next year
So basically stay with the 14 pro max 
Apples slogan for the last like 10 years Same same But different But still same
People should stop buying iphones to force apple to come with really new design and really new features
I for one am glad they didnt add fast charging because the battery will last longer Fast charging wears out your battery significantly faster Ive noticed it with my last two iPad Pros the batteries lost capacity much sooner when I used a 60 watt charger
013 nice throwing in a little united business class there 
Can you charge the lightning airpods using the new phone with the old lightning cable
Apple was Pretty underwhelming YOU are fantastic
Hey marques it not thunderbolt 4 not the same as pc and laptop
Im just going to wait 4 years and get them at a 60 discount
anker sponsor bro
Im in the wait for MKB review camp I will probably get in a few months
Bro is deep throating apple in this video so sad
No mention of your HUGE shoutout 
Nothing really new compared to the iphone 14 Pro max only USB C  Titanium Im sticking with my phone  wait for the 16 Pro Max next year 
Its just a screen
Even my standard Pixel 7 has USB 32 cmon Apple
"Great first impression

I have a question for Apple since they remove the lightning cable are they going to provide us inside the box with a type C cable since we are possibly upgrading and dont have a type C cable"
sure usbc is welcome but after having Lightning for over a decade I already have so many of the cables that it doesnt really matter All my friends and family have them laying around its not like they are hard to find when you need to charge
"Tx to the europian fr type c port
Apple ceoThis is most powerful usb 30  port 
Android hold my usb 31 port"
yeah android phones had all these specs many years ago
"I think its time to replace my iPhone 8 Plus which Ive had since 2018 I even replaced the screen and battery myself

Do you think so Or should I wait for the iPhone 16"
Are the non pro still 60 fps
I am thinking of buying my first iPhone Which one should I buy iPhone 15 or 5 pro
So nothing new again oh yes more new colors 
Final regular iPhone before the foldable iPhone
Such  a dxxx move from apple to limit the speed of the usbc Transfer rates are probably only limited by software to sell more pro models
A 60hz screen for the regular iPhone for that price in 2023 is CRIMINAL tbh
Its crazy how Android phones have type C from 2015 and apple in 2023 selling iPhone 15 with its biggest feature as type C
Huawei Mate 60  is an excellent phone
"so same as every year  similar body  processor upgrade  camera upgrade  slight software exclusives

USB C is the only major change"
Iphones are colossal waste of money
Dude is disappointed with apples lack of innovation
Its crazy how apple is still behind android SMH so glad I ditched the over heating garbage iphone
wonder if those incamera features will be available in the 14
I was all about the new iPhone for the usbc but now that it doesnt even charge fastuntil next years release I am tempted to wait another year to replace my phone
536 dont forget that making a local backup yes i also do that still now is faster with usb 30 speeds
What colour is iPhone15  THAT 0051
I wonder if the new iPhone Pro models will allow USB splitting Example I would love to record to an external SSD but I would also like to be able to plug in a highquality mic  So I wonder if you could do both
Its not just about USBC as android user wife using iPhone its so struggle to share charging cable kudos to the change
why cant they just make the mute switch pressable
same old shitohhh dynamic island3D spatiual video
Still see same fat bezels 
Waiting on the battery reviews but probably upgrading because I have the 13 pro max and theyre giving a good deal 
american wall sockets allways look surprised and shocked too me 
"Well what to say
I quite like new 1515 Pro 

BUT 60hz display in this price range for classic 15 isnt simply acceptable I mean even android phones for 190 have at least 90hz amoled jesus
Also reverse charging is quite fail from apple POV I mean how long they promise this feature already Since iphone 11 Missing interesting Quick Charging is not even necessary to comment
USBC restricted on classic ip15 is just terrible thing as well but im able to skip this Also Apple promising playing console titles I would be very careful here it could happen years ago In past there were very good PC ports on iphones  settlers GTA series civ series but today apple store is in terrible condition  mostly f2p non properly usable apps also half of them are fake with fake reviews  dont understand HOW is apple able to leave this in this condition As a result I didnt buy app on ios since GTA Vice City They promise something we will get two RE and I woudnt be surprised if all remain in conditions as today apple store full of barely usable f2p like android market

I have 13 mini and I would srsly appreciate 15 mini or SE with smaller display I mean I still use iphone but there could be so much things improved How many users will use camera fetaures as promoted Let me guess  a few It looks like that apple is closed in his own small reality where are just youtubers influencers and people from movie area"
lol charge speed is good for people that cant change their phone every year
Same 60hz lmao
im thinking about getting a 15 Plus ive been on the 8 Plus since it released and i finally cracked the glass back a few days ago also only having 64GB has been a nightmare trying to manage over the last 6 years
Just a other boring iPhone At this point theres really no reason to upgrade
Fast charging will be ready for iPhone 16  16 Pro and Pro max 
Fast charging is for the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max
Every Year all phones move one step ahead to turn into Nokia Lumia
14 is basically the 15 and you pay more for a cheaper phoneI hate how pro doesnt look pro   The side button is dumb like stop being lazy 
The biggest feature is that which the government forced upon Apple Really
Ill stick to my 14 Pro for few more years apple is not being innovative anymore
At this point they should just call it iCamera Its the only thing they seem to update
Who else notice the difference in audio quality
My freaking massage gun has USBC charging My 4 cabinet light has USBC charging This is such a nonupgrade and they only did it because they were forced to Standard iPhone 15 still only has USB 20 speeds which is just mind blowlingly stupid
ITS JUST USB C
"Nice infomercial what about talking about weight and thickness 
These phones are getting progressively heavier and thicker and you are silent as you were for previous versions reviews"
I have an xr is it worth the upgrade
I love the name drop of mkbhd at the apple event it was mad heart warming seeing how far u came
I was waiting to watch your review if I had an IPhone 14 pro or Pro max I dont think I would go for the 15 whatever its just because I have a 12pro the back glass is broken and the charging port doesnt work very well thats the only reason Im getting the 15pro or pro max Think the IPhone is due for a new body design We need something different the iPhone is not a Mercedes G wagon or a wrangler its just a phone
Ive been on the Samsung Galaxy Bus since the Galaxy 2 Havent upgraded since the Note 20 RIP the Note Series Skipped the last few years cause it doesnt seem like that huge a leap so for the first time Im contemplating jumping on the iPhone What will I miss most besides the fast charging and the SPen What will I love most
If they had enabled fast charging via usbc they will have a hard time to keep up with the charging speed in future iPhones without ports Wireless charging is cool but it cant keep up with wires speed
not the stock photo of a 3rd party 30pin connector 
337 200 redmi phones have that
No fast charging  Ill stick with Samsung
I guess its time to say goodbye to my beloved iPhone XS Max The best phone I ever had and still works like it should but regarding updates 5G and speed its time to move on The 15 Pro Max will be the new iPhone for me Lets hope it will last as good as my XS Max
Ngl very dissapointing They are massively trailing behind the competition in features and new technologies especially in the budget compartment Non pro model doesnt even have optical zoom camera and 120 hz display in 2023
1030 does the black iphone has a dent on the top right corner
The obvious reason for not including fast charging and high data transfer rates is that apple will realise those gradually over the next few years as new features  to try and trick you into feeling you need to buy this years phone
I have the iPhone XS Max and Im still not impressed Skipping until my phone no longer powers on They all do the same thing I dont get caught up in the Apple Hype
You know he got paid a bag to talk good about it 
All the little things you mentioned they could have given us on this iPhone Apple is probably waiting until the next iPhone to give it to us Even though they could have given it to us this time around Its all about giving us just enough updates but not throwing all their cards on the table so that they have updates for next year Money money money
Google be like  wasnt I doing next gen portraits from 2 yrs  
I thought I was gonna shear something new but its really just the USB C and camera
Subpar Apple event at best Theres nothing to be wowed about anymore
I went from a 8plus to a 10xs max in 2022 still have the 8plus as a backup now Ill be going from the 10xs max to the iPhone 15 pro  I never believed I had to upgrade every single year and my current iPhone work perfectly  Now Ill have 2 backups instead of one and the main reason for the upgrade is the usbc upgrade  Im 31 and normal when it comes to tech but this is a major change to me
640 no new fast charging because theyre saving that so they have a reason to sell us a new phone next year Personally the 20W charging is pretty fast already
I have an 11 pro max I am only interested in the camera If it was 10x optical zoom it would be a no brainer With only 5x Im a bit on the fence
"Fuck me I want the 15 pro max or whatever I just got the 14 pro though so probably wont get it til 16 or something

Probably just gonna wait til next year honestly Im happy with my phone at the moment even if I have to use lightning for a while"
My 14 pro started glitching 1 month in advance in preparation for the release of the new iPhone
Sumsung be pushing their fold ads more now 
0 exitrment for iphones same thing  the only new thing is a Europe Union imposition xD
How does it feel being quoted by Tim Cook 
Tired of iterations give us new not seen before tech on the phones like Microsofts copilot that with just communication with my phone I can tell it to actually make usable letters to others for some purpose make keynote presentations with speaker notes and fulfilling regulatory requirements A pocket coworker would be the bomb And have it Available for free to use This would be mind bending new and useful
Moving from 12 to 15 since larger battery life and finally usb c on top of being affordable for my own liking I was gonna get the pro but eh as long the camera is really good like the 14 pro then I am a happy man
Certainly not a worthy upgrade for anyone using a phone from the past decade or so Apple is so cheap yet so expensive Love how you didnt mention the 30 usbc to lightning adapter they also announced LOL
not a new phone just an update from iphone14
The older crow is going to get lost lol theyll be whats these lol
Not worth the upgrade yet 
Keeping my 13 mini
whys everyone so amazed that they solved a problem they created with the usb port
The cushions with matching passes Hilarious
"I have the 2nd Gen SE and the only thing I occasionally want is better cameras 

Im planning on waiting until my phone is no longer supported until I upgrade
Im actually looking forward to going from a slightly more powerful iPhone 8 to iPhone 1718

My main thoughts on phone releases is what more do you want from it 

Do we really need manufacturers to release new models every year"
Im kinda bumped that small 15 pro didnt get the 5x telephoto lens I guess Im using my 13 pro for another year 
"I love the natural color Im interested in the new pro features but dont feel they are a must have I have the 14P and i7 as a Breel cam Maybe Ill get the 15P and use the 14P as Breel leaving the i7 as a Creel 
One thing about this video I find entertaining are all the lemmings mindless walking around the background looking everywhere but getting nothing done Thank you for your highly informative video As always great content with real world insight"
12 mini  15 pro feels like a huge upgrade
Its the iPhone from last year just say it dam
I think that Apple may be moving away from creating massive innovation from release to release but will instead be working on a massive flagship every 5 or so versions Sort of like the how the 6 7 8 remained the same then the 10 was released 11 12 13 14 15 and hopefully something huge has been in the works for the 16 
Why does apple always disappointlike at this point you should retire making phones
"Im switching back to the iPhone I had iPhone up until 2018 when I switched to Samsung only because of a BOGO deal 

S10 and S21 Ultra have been great but I prefer the simplicity of the iPhone I had been holding off and switching back simply because of the charging port Honestly USBC is the only feature that I needed to see to switch back Looking forward to preordering the iPhone 15 Pro Max"
iPhone took a lot from Blackberry I still think BB was so a head of its time If you dont believe me go see what features the BB phones had before all of these new phones
Not worth the upgrade in my opinion Since I have the 14 pro max I will wait for 16th
iPhones innovation has always been patterned to the old Xperia Phones
Can you explain why they didnt mention the battery life like other years
I almost reconsidered an iphone not looking for phones rn but I would consider one in the future if it had a fast charger Thats one feature from androids I really like They charge so fast But Apple finally going in the right direction feelsgoodman Im proud of them  Also its a good thing that theyre making phones more replaceable That is also a good thing Thanks for your smartphone coverage over the years You probably wont see this comment but you are an inspiration to me I hope youre doing well 
Yay i can get the 13 now
Apple always holds tech back for the next iPhone generation
"Amazing quality video and informative as always D

Just a hopeless question did they bring back the physical sim card tray back"
Usb c gonna stop fraud apple from thieving money for fast chargers
Marques dont fly economy little boy
The funny part is that Apple makes the same type of upgrades on EVERY phone ie Faster proc more RAM better camera Nothing in the new iPhone would force a user to upgrade at all Unless you want the latest or greatest the best advantage of the newer iPhones is 5G
Sorry why you dont say that iPhone 15 line is always 60hz screen
"upgraded to the s23ultra  looks like the same phones for years These upgrades still dont compare to android
 Love my s23ultra wont go back"
Nice upgrades but Ill hold onto my iPhone 13 Pro Max for a 2nd year and then get a greatly discounted 15 Pro Max when the 16s come out
cant help but noticed the tonsurton pillow and the ID card in the background Love those attention to details
Ill keep my 13 pro max lol
Just gutted how they got rid of the gold colour tbh and I liked the gloss finish of the edges too for aesthetics reasons
So they updated the port but theyre still behind  and still no folds
IFans how to use USBC 
Iphone 
Im gonna say it againbattery life on pro 13 was a beast 14 pros battery life sucks  Hope 15 pro treats ya well
Id really like the Pro or Pro Max in pink  Disappointing that blue is the only color other than black white and different white
I wish they would make a Pro mini
Basic iPad already is USB C
Everybody is scrambling to put out the most flattering review so they can be front and center at Apples next event
wow usb c in 2023  why does apple disable comments at every keynote There are enough people who throw money down their throats
I just hope Really hope They give the new ipad mini the a17 bionic Because the ipad mini isnt updated yearly if they give it a16 then the ipad mini lineup isnt getting AV1 Decoder for at least another 2 years 
If this goes on the hype for iPhone will soon end Maybe other OS will capture some share of market
they quoted you on the MacBook
So as usual behind with tech compared to Android about 4 years and over priced and will be bought up by the Apple cult and deemed innovative
USB C was not an Apple innovation they were forced by EU laws
Im not getting that new iphone it is not worth that much money for what it offers Cheers
Mine is currently iphone 13 PM I think 15 PM is enough upgrade for me to buy
The only review that matters
I want one because I still have a 12 pro max and I always go for the max but its getting more expensive
As someone who has never cared for the Pro iPhones before this is the first time that I would actually spend the extra money for a pro model
Do we know if the new Natural Titanium on the iPhone is the same Titanium color on the Apple Watch Ultra
I told myself I wouldnt upgrade from the 12 until usb c Guess Im getting a 15
I thought Id be upgrading this year because of usb c  but Ill probably stay with the 13 pro max a bit longer
This is the perfect opportunity to upgrade from the XR to the 14 and avoid purchasing 10 new cables for home work and car
Apple is deliberately adding Ultra features to Pro Max You know what I meant 
Apple has gotten to the point where now those who had historically been tempted to upgrade their iPhone every year now are comfortable doing so every 3 years Ill be doing the same this year upgrading from a 12 Pro Max
same chip from iphone 14 pros into regular 15s and they still wont give yall 120hz in 2023 thats crazy
I am currently using the iPhone 11 so definitely its time to switch to the iPhone 15 Lol D
I am a pixel user for 10 years amd I planning on gettting a usb c iphone
I will be getting a Pro
People will sell their bodies for   every new iPhone that comes out
Cant find a single reason to upgrade from my iPhone 13 PM
Still using my XR  will not upgrade unless this one dies or gets unsupported For me a phone is just a phone
Ill wait for the iPhone 18 pro max
Why no say something on the wight  
Why usbC is overhype when they announced it We had that on android phones for years 
Everything gets a major update every 2 years
WOW Ill wait for Iphone20 to get 15 for the charger alone
I have the 14 pro max and nope from where its going I will probably no upgrade till maybe 4 years down the line lol
I kinda missed whether ProMotion was going to make it to the base iPhones anybody knows if the iPhone 15 and 15 got ProMotion This is literally the only reason I buy the Pro model
How many action buttons are going to be shortcuts to ok google
The fact that iPhone switching to the same cable standard everyone else has had for years is their biggest innovation by far proves how stale and repetitive their launches have become
So how do you mute the phone if you have customoted the button to something else Do you have to customize it to mute everytime u wanna mute it
Do not waste your money on iphone 15   Pro Maxabout 2000 eurosleaving China with cheap labour could be the increase in price
The cameras of 15 pros look a bit far from each other Imean ofc they added that 5x zoom so they needed more space or something
"whats up with the green and purple line 
on the top portion of the video is that just me or can everyone see that"
lightskin marques at 011
If Apple enabled sideloading I would buy the most expensive model right now
i was disappointed to not see the entire iphone lineup being updated to USBc I just want the cheapest iPhone SE dont want all the bells and whistles
iPhone 16 will feature fast charging they need to split small features every year because is just almost imposible to deliver something revolutionary every year
Ill keep my XS until it dies  I havent needed any new feature since I upgraded from my iPhone 6 in 2018 Its only a phone browser and video player for me
The idea that the main selling point for this phone is USBC is insane 
I have the iPhone 12 Pro since launch 2020 thinking about upgrading to a new phone for a while now
USBC and you get limited port speed for an iphone 15 LMAO better shell out cash for that PRO model so you can have full USBC speeds 
Pls 1 minute silence for lightning port
My boss asked me if I watched the apple event I told him I watch it every 3 years so I can see changes happen
I have been waiting for this I am a lowly iPhone XR user and was planning on getting a 14 until they delayed USBC I knew it was coming and just refused to get the last of the lightning phones  Not sure I really need a Pro but we will see how I am feeling the day I hit the Apple Store
YAY YAY YAYYYYY
I feel so so bad getting my iPhone 14 in may I was switching from my trusty OnePlus 7 All I wanted was the 48MP sensor from the 14 and the type c thats it Thats all I wanted
Apple is saving the usb c potentials for next year Introduce usb c this year and sell the lightning to usb c converting adapter Next year increase usb c charging speed and sell a faster charging brick Money money money
Then nothing new right Then nothing new right  
no thanks
Type c was a game changer  so good job apple
As always amazing presentation Marques  So iPhone 15 is getting closer to Google Pixel 7 and Samsung Ultra 23 but still falls well short on optical zoom  Also I wonder how many Apple people will buy the 29 lightning to USB instead of just buying a 10 USB C cable 
The reason they added the telephoto lenses just on the pro max was to give people a better reason to buy it because until now the only reason to buy the pro max was for a bigger screen
After i got the iphone 13 mini and a airpods pro gen2 which all use lightning cable now iam kinda foked in the long run cuz there will be no one that use lightning 
Still nothing new
What is that I thought is gonna be something new
Im wondering how Marques isnt tired reviewing the same phone every year 
ishit
I still maintain we reached PEAK PHONE about two years ago nothing new to add
getting usbc is cool just to bring all devices together using the same port but it not offering any real benefit other than that other than the pro 30 speeds i was fully expecting fast charging and it was going to be one of the main reasons for me upgrading lowkey disappointed ngl
considering the nightmare that has been pixel 6 pro the temptation to switch back to iphone is high
Same old shiz
The iPhone 14 didnt sell as they aspected so they gave us a massive discount to the 15
Fun fact  3 nm is the lowest u can go before the electrons stars to bounce randomly and cant be controled lol btw imagine needing to press a button to open flash light or camera or even a app that what u have hand movment lol
Calling USBC  a feature in 2023 and be excited about it  Apple is treated different
I have a 12 Pro Max which still works very well I told myself Id only upgrade if usb c was introduced Given that Apple did the bare minimum by giving the 15 USB 20 I might wait another year Maybe Apple was under time constraints and didnt have a time to add that Apple flair Also what are the refresh rates of the screens on the Pro Max
I think the mute switch was one of the key things that i was jealous of from an iPhone now that they took it away i dont like it anymore
"A Question
Is it possible to charge your 2nd Gen Airpods Pro with the Lightning port through your Phone aswell or is it only possible with the new Usb C Airpods Maybe someone can help me out here"
Usbc 30 will be new feature in iPhone 16 faster charging in iPhone 17
Its just USBC cut it out lol
Is it worth updating if you have a 12 pro max 
Congrats  ur name was mentioned twice at the Apple event  we all are proud and happy for you Keep going and achieving
I have a lot of USBC accessories But this is first time I actually see USBC that doesnt support 30 But wait next year they will announce pro version upgrade to 31
Fast charging with usbc would be an iPhone 16 feature
If you change the action button to another app or something does it still work as a mute button
Apple sure is gonna make a killing off of the security and privacy enhancements on these new devices and services
OK I am upgrading iPhoen 14 Pro Max has been disappointing Dynamic Island is OK but lacks customization Action button as shutter seems interesting USBC is late but is VERY welcoming I am expecting 35W Charging which is not fast charging per todays standard Gaming Dont really care because it gets so hot that the screen would dim to unplayable state Try the game Pascals Wager It might well be my last iPhone if they dont come up with foldables in two years
Jesus Apple are infuriating So with USB C they could have put in things like fast charging and USB 4thunderbolt speeds which have been available for years now  instead they hobble it and keep it at 20 and  a measly 5gbps USB 30 for pro  not even 31 or 32 which have been mainstream for ages  I bet theyll milk it for a few years pretending to be adding cutting edge tech presenting adding usb 32 as some kind of innovative gift from Apple HQ
Its sad that the biggest highlight upgrade is that it got a freaking type C port 
Still my S23u rocks better than i15
I was curious about the focal lenghts thing on the main camera those diferent focals are somehow optical or are they just digital zoom bc If its digitalmeh
"A note for everyone at the end of my post
Ive had my iPhone X and I had to change the battery only once It still works like new no issues and frankly Id keep it even longer but my main reasons for upgrading now are

Night mode

Wont be able to upgrade to the new iOS  which isnt a must honestly but still a point

The camera overall  although my pics  videos are still HD and 4K so again not a must just a point 

The ProMotion display  nice but not a must have either 

 thats pretty much it

I decided when I got the X I might wait a few generations before upgrading  first time in doing so  and it seems to have been worth it

From 11 to now the 15 there havent been so many ground breaking things  like there used to be and thats fine I think with all the phones generally they are plateauing 
How much more can you possibly do to a phone at this point

While I love Apple  have an iPad Mini 6 Watch Phone iMac TV  Ive realized to now dial it back and wait a few generations  5 for me  before upgrading This way even if the changes from one year to the next arent so major like from 14 to 15 they will always be a big upgrade for me  worth the price I pay Just now trying to decide to get a black  Which Ive traditionally gotten and liked  or the Titanium  since its the first of its kind "
"Iphone MEHteen 
Ill stick with my iPhone 12 mini as it is the most powerful mini phone you will ever get Besides the 13 which is a minimal upgrade
Still holding onto hope that they make a mini Pro in the future Theres still a market for people who dont want a freaking tablet in their pocket"
The gaming part of having Resident Evil Village RE 4 and Death Stranding run on the 15 pro is going to be interesting going forward
bit of a bummer if usbc is the big highlight since the port changed only happened because of EU regulations going to get the 15 at some point
Update not worth it But if you want the lates and greatest think 
THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL ABOT THE IPHONE 15 THAT WOULD MAKE ME WANT TO GET IT IMA STICK WITH THE SE THE PHONE MADE FOR THE 99
Totally getting it
"Still not enough for me to switch off of my S23 Ultra I guess Fast charging and significantly less impact of planned obsolescence is just gonna keep outdoing iPhone until Apple innovates a bit harder andor finally adds those features to iPhone 

I do like the direction they are going though they pushed really hard against going to USBC I am glad it finally went through globally Pretty much all mobile accessories should be using it by now
I hope to see Apple starting to launch more tech in their phones and tablets for that matter though I am happy to see the 3nm A17 Pro coming to a mobile device heat efficiency is imperative"
I have an iPhone 11 so Ill be waiting for your reviews to see whether to upgrade or not
Watching this on iPhone 14 Pro 
now that they have changed cables and they wont have the excuse that people reuse their old cables anymore would it be included in the phone box ol
I have a 13mini and I am still not sure if I want to drop 1k on an upgrade
Apple is playing us all They make the product 3 better and we all buy it They have the ability to make it 100 better right now However they choose to give it to us in pieces so they can maximize profit Apple used to excite me now Im just waiting for the pie phone so I can get off apples tits
Apple hasnt done anything groundbreaking with the iPhone since FaceTime and that was in the iPhone 4 Maybe Siri but still that was the iPhone 4s Were on the 15 now bro 
No fast charging and only usb2 data is insane 
As a iPhone 14PM user Im more excited to see what Samsung is going to bring with the S24U
The focal lengths are because 24 28 and 35 are extremely popular focal lengths in photography One might always want 35 if theyre walking around doing street photography for exampleor always want 24 if they do wide landscape shots
These videos are so nostalgic I remember being really interested in new iPhones even tho I couldnt afford them as a kid lol Funny feeling Getting the iPhone 15 pro upgrading from a 12 pro max
Im in camp gonna buy last years version for a discount
Boring Apple  How about a flip phone or a fold phone option
Really hope for a mini version to be establish
Somebody will find a way to use the action button to use Google Assistant
does someone know which watch strap he us using for his Apple Watch
Totally not fkn worth it
641 Wait really My iPhone 13Pro can charge to 80 in almost 1520 minutes L
Skipping this gen phones and watches
A17 Pro  So now iPhone 16 would have a slightly different A17 Chip Thats how you get out of the this year pro phone to next year iphone gimmick
Also is it too much to ask for a foldable phone  I want one but I want it to have iOS lol
Not much to see here Something that others have had previously and they make it sound as though it is earth shattering Definitely nothing work upgrading to unless youre several versions back
Now lets introduce USBZ and make apple go back to the drawing board
Still barely holding on with an 11 Pro with a shattered screen Its about time I upgrade lol
Summary if you are not going to do a big change in the version you have avoid to do it doesnt make senseits the same
Why do you still support Anker I thought it was unanimous that Anker was a dubious company Honestly losing a little credibility right now
No Fast charging not buying it
1TB 14ProMax here definitely not switching until the Ultra comes out
I just ordered a 14 Pro a few days ago upgrading finally from my iPhone 8 and have felt hesitant to get info on the 15 lineup  I guess I was worried to get instant FOMO  but after seeing it Im okay It doesnt seem like too far of a step forward and Im fine to stick with the Lightning plug for the next six years since thats apparently how long I keep an iPhone for So Ill just be staying excited for my new refurbished iPhone 14 Pro whichll be delivered later today 
"Lets be realistic we shouldnt be fastcharging on the regular 1 there are radial health concerns that im sure people will have their own opinions on 2 it degrades current batteries drastically 3 the thermal impacts when fast charging regularly
Its too soon"
not a fan of anker after their security issues I Prefer ugreen now
Finally someone said it No fast charging was so cringe and annoying This was the time to do it and they didnt
Wow that usb 3 chip info really drives home the fact that theyre doing this because they have to If they went usb20 speed again with this iPhone pro the proraw users wouldnt even consider it They probably wouldnt sell enough But now theyre going to get a bunch more people upgrading to the fulluse USBC
Any word on whether the new action mute button will still be able to mute and still do one of the secondary assigned functions too Seems like losing the ability to mute your phone just to gain these other functions might not be optimal to many
What a lousy update Was not worth an event USB C USB 2 Unless pro but still no fast charging  Apple seems deliberately delaying what is basic for every new Android Really lousy
Definitely getting the 512gb 15 Pro Max in Black Titanium 
Same mobile phone with another name Not worth it
I know why they didnt go to thunderbolt 3 speeds They do this because they want to release a new iPhone every year So even though they have the tech  they will only upgrade just alittle bit so they can have something for the next year
Very dissapointing from Apple Not even a button where you can close all tasks simularly Why do the even upgrade at all if everything stays the same
Nobody mentions the massive fix they did for the Vision Pro by allowing the iPhone to take spatial videos so you can record your kids birthday party like a normal screen parent rather than looking like a stalker from the future I would genuinely love to see those videos work across any vr headset
I think Im the only one whos disapointed they havent changed their physical design much ahhh as an industrial designer its just so boring they all look the same
Wow apple is coming out with features that Android came out with 12 years ago
title is biggest cope ever
"Excellent show as expected

Ill wait for Apple to venture into ZFold territory before Im interested in Apple again"
Im hanging on to my 13 mini for dear life for as long as I can 
Im on an XR and if I end up upgrading itll almost certainly be to the prior year base model 14 not the new 15 Just dont see enough reason to jump to the front of the pack when the 14 will be a solid phone for a few years yet
Always the best videos you and techsantos
The side button is very stupid  we will miss the useful switch
i love iphones
Im looking forward to the upgrade since Im ready to move away from my XR
I seriously dislike the action button Think about how many times you would accidentally active it And what impression It is the SAME phone as two years ago
Sill having 60hz on both 15 and 15 is insane 
Apple didnt invent TypeC they perfected it
Will upgrade from the iPhone 12
Same shit different day is what I think of this underwhelming IPhone 15 They had to change to the USB port because they were basically forced to change by the EU
I really dont understand where the new is Same phone as years ago
On the surface its the same phone as prev year
Did they add 120hz display for iphine 15
I was so excited for all the cool stuff that was announced and then I remembered the Achilles heel at least for me eSIM only
I have yet to this day met a single person who cared about not having usbc on the iPhone Its a change no one but the EU asked for
i just cant get how a usb c is such a big deal
Looking forward to upgrading from my iPhone 10 Its finally time to put it out to pasture
Amazing technologyUSBC port brushed rails configurable button
Im using an iPhone 13 Pro most likely going to get the iPhone 15 pro was considering getting the Max but Im not convinced its worth it
No no faster charging well now I have to change my pitch 
Why is Marques okay with iPhone 15 having a 60hzI used 120hz for a year and bought iPhone 13 Immediately sold it because of the scrolling speed which s so slow
They have run out of innovationstill got the shit camera bump  only put usb c cause they were forced to APPLE is dead
Introducing iPhone 16 Pro the only one that will have fast charging in this production line
"Why Marques always hold back his true opinions on iphones 
Oww  Because hes iphone fanboy"
Id like to take this opportunity to welcome all the Apple drones to the big USB family
So if I upgrade from my 14 Pro to a 15 Pro I will still have to carry a lightning cable around with me for my AirPods Ill pass thanks Action button looks cool but not worth it
I think the fact that they offhandedly mentioned relaunching AirPods Pro 2 with USBC and didnt mention the AirPods Max means that they are getting a bigger redesign and will have their own spotlight later this year
They couldnt have included fast charging with USBC this year Theyd have nothing new to add next year
In camp dont care at all
Where I can get such wallpaper 
Apple has always held back readily available technology because they know it can be next years feature Look for iPhone 16 to have fast charging and thunderbolt transfer rates RememberThe original iPad didnt even have a camera
I need to see all the titanium colors in person but I dont need to upgrade from a 14 Pro or at least thats I keep telling myself
Getting pro max in Titian gray
Jesus died for our sins so that we can go to heaven He payed our price Jesus didnt come into the world to condemn the world but to save the world Put your trust in Jesus Christ and he will grant you the gift of heaven
When a new 1000 plus phone is launched and every YouTuber s opinion is the biggest news of this years even is the usb c port you know theres a problem but yes I will be purchasing but got my eye on you Apple
I have the iPhone 13 Pro Max Worth the upgrade
Apple is way behind in terms of Samsung I mean they came out with AOD only last year Samsung had it 6 years before that even apples charging is slow and the cameras dont even have zoom just stick with android
I have iPhone 14 Pro Max but Google Pixel Phones have the best cameras especially removing objectspeople
Wow charging my devices just with one cable Thank you Apple for that inventing oh man 
Im torn Still running an iPhone 13 Pro Max and wanted to upgrade Outside of the USBC port I dont feel like there has been any real change and now dont want to upgrade again It used to seem like every year had a huge jump in tech with Android still following this path but iPhones have just become dull
only innovative stuff this time is USBC a decade late and QuickAction button this can be new habit for people doesnt matter the processing speed and other stuff because 99 of the users only gonna use it for photos and add snapchat insta filters on top of them anyway but following samsung on adding higher optical zoom in ProMax version is good
Just to highlight that if Apple wants to sell phones or iPads in the EU it will need to update all iPhones and iPads to USBC by the end of 2024 Including any older models such as iPhone 13 14 etc
this video could have been three minutes long
USB C or as Apple users have been calling it for 6 years Android charger
Good to see the USBC change finally also the baby steps towards repairability Ill keep rocking my 12 until it dies
This may be the first year where I hang on to my current phone Nothing of note is that big a difference to warrant an upgrade Especially given the mandatory pro max price increase
feel like calling chip a17 pro means iphone 16 wont get that chip next year some sort of cut down non pro version
Im still using my 11 pro max Really only missing out on 5G and the higher refresh rate Beyond that I dont really care This phone is fast enough and I replaced the battery at Apple last year so that it will last me longer Ill probably wait another 2 years
Because of Ipads success we will never have a sort of Apple Dex to enjoy Iphones on big screens It is a pity
I dont have a friends with an android phone 
155 the only ipad that still is sold with Lightning is the 9th gen iPad the 10th gen from a yearish ago was when they officially sold their main 3 iPad devices with USBC
I recently switch from the 8 to my girlfriends 12 because I was hoping the USBC rumors were true when they started floating around this phone already felt like a great upgrade but Im excited to make that 37 gen jump
60hz display what a joke but for Apple sheeple good enough i guess 
"i think a lot of Apples energy right now is on the vision pro as this phone seems really safe Other that usbc there are no huge features or big aesthetic changes I do think there are some cool stuff here and there but it all is just kinda boring in my book and nothing that makes me want to try it or see it as anything revolutionary

Like its not awful it just seems a bit dull I do think if you havent upgraded for the past few years this could be great phone to jump too As it has all the resent features plus pro features like dynamic island coming to the full lineup with usbc which may increase its life span for a bit and cut down on wires you need But if you already have a more recent phone then its probably not worth itt and it may be best to wait one more year"
Besides the LONG awaited upgrade to USBC which they still botched by not including a fast charging capability especially in the new chip which supports USB 30 theres nothing to see here and no reason to upgrade from 14
Wow A USCBC Not like this change came by being forced by the government Oh and whats that a mute button OH EM GEE Innovation is dead
I have an iPhone 8
New chip and some cam improvements nothing to get exited about Yeah it looks nice but so does a 12 or 13 And USBC was an obvious one No real innovations
Eh still the same old phone imo Hasnt changed since the 12 series Traded my 12 Promax for a Samsung z flip 5
Luv my 14 pro and da silent button
i always had 2 main reasons not to use an iphone the dumb charging port and the software limitations now i amhalfway to consider getting one of the 15s
"i havent upgraded sense my 12  i really dont feel like i missing out on anything  i have apple everything tv watch ipad computer so really like why when my 12 looks like the 15  probably functions like at 15 should i get a 15 

also usb c to c so will you need a dongle sense most cars only has a usb in ordered to charge or play music "
Overpriced garbage
Is there any way you could give a few tips for university students in heavy STEM majors for new laptops My daughter has had 2 expensive Dell computers a Latitude and XPS within 2 years The both broke shortly after the warranty expired With Dell you need to send the computers in and it takes weeks to repair Something students dont have is time to wait The Geek Squad will also not repair Dell computers We need to buy a computer asap
Apple Always using revolutionary 10 year old technology
I have a 12 Pro Max so looking to upgrade to that 15 Pro By the way caught that bit of Apple quoting one of your reviews good for you brother
No fast charging what a shame
so theres little or nothing new here usb c no fast charge oh dear welcome to the rest of the world Last years chip shocking 60 htz screen bad who would buy such old tech
hi guys im just asking how much will the iphone 15 pro be 128g
Still waiting for the new mini One can hope
why theres no same tradein option everywhere as in US like 1000 off 
I dont feel that the upgrades are that substantial  unless I get a super sweet deal on an iPhone Ill start with my new iPhone 12 
Just the usbc 
I have the iPhone X since 6 years its really slow and my screen is literally broken so I was looking for this new iPhone 15 pro so much Im kinda disappointed for me its just a 14pro upgraded the 2 main things that changes is the usbcest and the action button
Always love coming back to your event in summary videos Im usually in class for these fall ones so I appreciate the in depth summary Finally upgrading from my 11 Pro Max to the 15 Pro Max and Im so damn excited
Hear me out As someone who flips between both androidOS phones and IPhone this confirms I can get a Zfold5 now and bum a charger from my friends 
The changes to these new iphones are so nominal now compared to how they were it seems so needless to release all these new phones each year
Apple have being so boring that im not even caring when an new iphone comes
Didnt you predict that Apple would make a portless iphone instead of a USBC iphone
Im glad Ive waited to get a new phone My entire family recently switched to Iphone 14s and I was the odd one out holding on to my dear OP7 Pro Alas my time has come to make the switch as well And what great timing Exicited for the new updates and especially for the cameras
Im glad Apple finally invented USBC Im hoping in a couple of years they will also invent Superfast charging n reverse wireless charging for their iphones
Apple  greatest marketing company in the world
I still have to wait for the airpods pro to be usbc Then I can change
Meh with my 12 pro after upgrading from my iphone 6 lol this one doesnt seem like a big upgrade
Not just becoz they are greedy asf Apple held out on the USBC port to have bragging rights when they finally implement it on their phones
The MKBHD review is the review we all wait to see I know others tend to release reviews faster but this is the one that matters most
The change is USB c only this man only talking like a godi media of apple
idk between buying the 15 or 14 because my samsung phone got water that destroyed it  and all my family said buy an iphone but idk whick one to pick
The 13 pro has a bigger photo sensor than the 14 pro and 15 pro Any chance you can do a photo comparison Thank you
These events are just useless anymore spending all that time and money to give a MINOR or INCREMENTAL updateupgrade  Who cares
Sticking with my 13 Pro max No reason to upgrade I might even get an android for my next phone
I was honestly most excited for the precision finding added to Find My for friends Even if its only useful if both of you have the newest iPhone for now I have a feeling this will be a huge feature a few years from now as more people upgrade to phones with an updated ultra wide band chip
Sounds like more of the same but do welcome USBC FINALLY
430 And intel has their overclockable CPUs designated with the letter K i913900K That K makes it a more powerful CPU that is Intels version of this idea of Pro From my understanding its just an arbitrary lock put in the CPU for one reason or another NEVRTHELESS its an arbitrary difference and it wouldnt surprise me to find out the PRO CPU Apple has made is just as fancy
Just to clarify the 15 Pro and Max does allow for fast charging
Titanuim is stronger but is it as flexible too When you drop your stainless steel phone the steel absorbs most of the impact and does not let as much of that transfer to the glass  thus the glass doesnt break as easily Im not a scientist but I would say titanium  as it is harder  is not as flexible as SS and drop tests will probably show that Dropping the 15 wont be the same as dropping an older SS model
I dont need a review this is not worth the money
Ill wait for the 16
I travel a lot and the option for ONLY eSIM is a bummer internationally not all regions have eSim easily available
Apple used to be the trend setter but now things seem different Type C from android and probably future iphones will take on more android features If it wasnt for the quality wouldve already made the switch but down the line change seems inevitable
im on the 11 pro which for the most part has been a great phone for me switched from Pixel 7 to 11 pro because my BMW m2 only has carplay lol Ultimately the experience on Android is still better than iPhonebut iPhone has come in clutch for me on multiple occasions all because of imessage lol and now integrated with the ecosystem by getting a macbook pro I can see how truly powerful it is So ill be getting the 15 pro for sure
I preferred heavier phone feels less cheap
Think Ill stick to my 14Pro in gold 
The charging is faster  27 to 35 watts
Id love to see how the iPhone 15 pro max compares to the s23 ultra
using an Iphone 11 upgrading to 15 Pro will actually fell like an upgrade
look so cute
looks the same tbh
Will we get the nextgen portraits in the iPhone 14 pro since it has the same hardware as the iPhone 15 base model
When youve clicked to watch this video the camp of Dont care at all is no longer an option to you
Hey Marques could I technically use the action button to unlock my Tesla through the short cuts app
Why cant you have multiple functions for the action button with multiple presses Seems obvious
"Since they launched Mx processor upgrade It feels like Apple is struggling to come up with new stuff and is desperate enough to scrap every smallirrelevant featureupgradething they can in order to showcase it as brand newinnovativegroundbreaking on a yearly basis
Its even crazier when you think about it because there are probably more than hundreds of employees at Apple whose only job is to do that constantly

But cant blame them Mx processors are amazing this status quo is easy for them to maintain and is economically viable"
10000 milliamp hours otherwise known as 10 amp hours but hey who likes simplicity
If Verizon pays me 1k to trade in my 13pro Ill upgrade
So much for Made For Apple saga
Are the camera lenses bigger 
Tbh its kind of silly they invite yall to these things when everything is prerecorded
heres me looking at a review of a Phone with features that Android gave 3 years agowtf
i Sheeeeeeepppppp
100 price increase because we cant force you to buy our chargers Thanks friends  
Wow USBC Apple proving theyre a step ahead innovation and Im pretty sure everything is going to have USBC next year
Basically these guys just made the same phone and called it iphone 15
they made the 14 pro max heavy af and now jerking off for making the new one a little bit lighter
Although the price increase on the Pro Max isnt welcome it can at least be justified that you technically arent paying more for less They need to just bump starting storage to 256 across the board for the same price as current Either way I am ordering the 512 version Very excited to get it and trade in my regular non pro 12
Chipinside
I have an iPhone 12 sooo maybe Ill get this Just for usbc tbh
Dont get me wrong I would love to upgrade from my iPhone 12 Pro Max but I can not justify the upgrade just yet with these incremental changes
"usb2 and no fast charging at 1k lel
The customizable button though is super cool I have my note 20 ultra setup to use the flashlight on a long press of the power button and I use it literally everyday"
I think Im getting one Havent decided between the 1515Pro
Im getting the pro max regardless
NonPro iPhone 15 versions  the USBC port transfers  charges at 20 circa 2000 rates Apple sucks so hard
"Not impressed
There is no a  reason to buy phone 15 for me"
Seeing your name in the Apple event was quite sensational tbh
So you can only program one thing to the action button at a time Or sequence presses brings up different things
I still have a couple of months before I can upgrade and Im thinking of getting this I will definitely be looking for long term updates
MKBHD really be brown nosing apple so much they actually have him with a quote in their presentation lmao
in the ad apple says that videos can be recorded directly to a external drive android phones already do this 
I watched this video hoping you would explain big changes for the iPhone 15 pro max so I can upgrade later this year and honestly Im not going to upgrade because the usbc is not a reason to upgrade and the little upgrade to the camera and the titanium body and the 17pro chip doesnt sound that impressive and I have the 13 pro max Unless somebody can convince me how much of a difference the 15 pro max is to the 13 pro max Im not upgrading it really sounds like apple had no big upgrade for the 15 line
For the first time in a long time Im not going to get the latest iPhone Pro Max immediately I think Im going to keep my 14 Pro Max Maybe get a Pixel Fold or wait for the Pixel 8 Pro
I have an iPhone 11 and have been wanting to upgrade to a pro max Been looking at 14 pro max for a while Do you recommend me try and get a 14 pro max cheaper with the 15s coming out or should I go 15 pro max I guess its price over features Would love to hear your thoughts Thanks in advance Loved the video
I think one overlooked benefit is that Apple users can now use a SSD drive to store their photos and videos therefore allowing them to easier free up memory on their devices This has been my method of both freeing up space on my phone since Samsung removed expandable storage It also allows me to transfer files between my ipad and other non Apple devices So my first suggestion for iphone users is to buy a portable SSD 
So just repair the screen on my XR Got it
Still no Touch ID is a shame for me
Lol he taken money from apple so he can make this shit like amazing
Only getting one due to the great trade in value from carriers 1k for my current phone so I can buyfinance a phone for 300 regardless of the minor changes Kind of a no brainer
15 too late for USB C
Thanks to the European Union
As always great review Thanks
iphone fan has amnesia every year apple must remind them of they have done the last year
What about the security Here in Ph Some cyber hackers were able to access the iPhone just by connecting to public wifi which is very alarming since the iPhone is supposed to have tighter cyber security right
Almost definitely going to get an iPhone 15 pro max  Between the USBC and the higher zoom capability I take a lot of shots across a wide river I really like waht Im seeing here
What I kinda dont like is that some of those new features are software limited only on iPhone 15 Why the automatic portrait mode is not also on iPhone 14 Pro The CPU is same as iPhone 15 there is no lack of performance Why iPhone 14 Pro can not have also 24 mpix photos Forcing people to buy new iphone because of some stupid conditions in the code Is this really innovation Or just greed for money
Im at this point convinced that all the new apple launches are all but scams   They are putting out new iPhones because it generates a ton of money on people want the latest and greatest  It isnt actually a scam but it isnt as big of an upgrade as they want you to believe   If for example nVidia did this with GPUs and you got a like 510 performance jump between the top teir generations they would get bashed so hard
No ProMotion 
Thank you for focusing on facts over opinion as well as speaking at a reasonable pace  I avoid content creators that speak too slowly or focus too heavily on opinions
Same old iPhone just reboxed
They have put a lot of emphasis on gaming and their gpu during the presentation I want to see it perform
Looks like Apple took a page out of Samsungs play book only 650 for a iPhone 14 Pro Max
I had iphone and i hated it I wont gonna buy any of apple products ever again
I have de 13 pro and I think Ill wait for the 16 haha
Steel is stronger than titanium  Titanium has a higher strength to weight ratio
Does anyone know if you can use a 14 pro max screen protector on the 15 pro max
104 yet another One Piece reference
The base iPhone 15 might be the biggest upgrade for those like me who tend to stay a few generations behind USBC dynamic island and the new camera are big changes even for people who were in the base 1314 Im rocking the 11 currently and I might just switch to take advantage of that carrier deal they mentioned
I think theyve lost the game imo Boring phones year after year Vanilla design with vanilla UI It works really well sure But its just the same year after year after year
There still isnt a huge difference between my 12pro and the new stuff Im waiting to see real world compatibility of Apple USBC with other USBC is or wait until mass adoption
Apple keynotes used to be exciting All thess iPhone 15 improvements are so minor that I cannot feel anything but disappointment
Doesnt feel like upgrading from my 14 Pro Max this time
watching this on my iPhone 6s
My man when a product is shit have the courage to say thats shit
The iPhone is a computer you hold in your hand What is the biggest upgrade you can make to your computer Ans More capable chip and more capable software That is  what Apple has done here and most people do not understand the impact This is the first phone to be using a 3mm processor that is significantly faster and more energy efficient The GPU chip has had a major upgrade The software that runs the phone has been greatly improved Much of camera fucntion on phones these days is related to machine learning and processing of images The improved portrait mode and tracking is a very big deal In addition the improved HDR will dramatically improve pictures The screen is 2x brighter the phone is lighter and made from higher grade materials The chip has 19 billion transistors up 20 that is unbelievable application of technology To give you an idea how much technology Apple is giving us the desktop i9 intel chip has 42 billion In other words your little Apple iPhone has more processing power than many windows desktops
I came from a Samsung S20 ultra to the iPhone 14 pro Not a chance Ill be getting another iPhone The iPhone is so far behind Samsung its sad to see so many jump on the iPhone simply because their favorite influencer uses one The specs are not even close and side by side pics are embarrassing to say the least My favorite flaw about the iPhone is when the ringer is on and Im on a phone call if I get a text the alert rings directly in my ear Its straight garbage iPhoners will adapt and just turn the ringer off when on a call It makes sense that iPhoners have adapted to dumb stuff and are brain washed to follow an influencer down any road This latest greatest iPhone doesnt even have fast charge Garbage
Thanks EU regulation  Cant wait to have replaceable batteries soon 
Informative without bashing or praise great review and this is why he gets the big bucks
Well its because of the EU government that done this is thing  thank god
Switched from 7 plus to 11 pro max this month after years and years and Im loving it my first iPhone without a home bottom now I was waiting to see the 15 but I dont really see something that would make me choose it instead of the 14 pro max thats what Im getting the 14 pro max purple because I love purple and its basically the same Got like 3 lightening cables so doesnt really matter I was thinking about the 15 plus however those colours are pretty bad
You dont need to say anyone have an iPhone charger USB C is universal
All your stuff your mac your iphone your friends android  yeah like everybody watching this video has all mac products
Thats not what wanderlust means
"Ill wait for iPhone 17 so that iPhone 16 will get cheap so and so iPhone 15s prices will drop
EZ"
if photo taking presets like Portrait Cinema Pano etc can be adjusted after the fact wouldnt UX design be cleaner if it was just ONE BUTTON Hold for the best video snap for the best photo In post make it what to want Software can do the rest
Gigabytes or gigabits  Megabytes or megabits
Im not seeing a reason to upgrade from the 13pro max Like yeah Usbc is great But to pay 1200 is wild for what I say is little improvements
Im gonna get rid of my green 13 pro max and get a 15 pro max The slow mo is broken on all 13s and Apple has refused to fix it and after only 15 years my phone is at 91 battery health
They probably added pro to the chip name so they can cheap out on usb3 on next years base model with the regular A17
"I think the biggest upset is that the new pro models ONLY have USB 3

Why not give the new USBC port the fastest possible controller Which is USB 4 or Thunderbolt as apple calls it unless Im wrong

Regular USB 3 isnt exactly fast for 2023 standards Praying this happens with the 16 Pros Thats looking like the one to upgrade to next"
I have nothing against Iphone even though Im a Samsung fan but its crazy to see these phones finally get so many new features that have been a part of Android for years One day I feel theyll be small to no real difference between an Android  iPhone besides the look and OS Other than that theyll perform pretty much the same
Were you excited when they quoted you during the keynote
Rent food and every day living expenses are too damn high to be throwing away money on a new iPhone to use it exactly the same way I use my current iPhone
How can i get the wallpaper on the render photo
Looking forward to the  price for the 15 Pro Max They already jacked up prices by 300 with the 14 so the 14 Pro Max with 256GB was 1600 I was fine with 1300 for the 13 but the new pricing pretty much forced me to get a Pixel 7 Pro The new regular 15 Plus seems like a good one though Will most likely pick one up next year when they are a bit cheaper
you are so easy to understand for a nonnative English speaker  you are the best
Still no High Refresh rate display on an 800 dollar phone 
Since there arent any flagship phones with a 35mm jack Ive been thinking of switching to Apple after my S10 dies and they adopted USBC This release was underwhelming enough to make me to go back to the drawing board
That Mother Nature video was the cringiest thing Ive probably ever seen
Where can I Find the iPhones wallpaper in the videos cover
I wonder what the sales of Apple is this year knowing the current inflation
I feel like in this age of inflation Apple keeping the same price for all models except the Pro Max is a good decision I am also not too worried about the nitpicks on action button But what I dont realize is that why doesnt Apple bring an easier toggle of location OnOff like Android does Why do I need to tap 67 times to get to the Location toggle I personally dont like keeping my location turned on all the time and I feel like its elementary and my right to have an easy location toggle in iOS I know I am talking about the software not the hardware but its all Apple so why not
Didnt warrant an event Barely worth of a press release
"So the question that I have with the controller is this Why not USB4 I mean Intel just announced Thunderbolt 5 which is based on USB4 v2  And the standard has been out for a while now but they went with USB3 likely some Gen version
Odd choice

Other than that I have to say this seems like the bare minimum The only thing really new is the action button and I am sure Samsung is making phonecalls over that"
all that multifunction button customisation is already available in IOS16 and its buttonless check out double and triple tap in the Touch part of Accessibility it does exactly the same thing
uhm waiting for the iPhone 17 pro
Same old  Apple ripping off people   When USBC is the headliner WITH NO FAST CHARING lol   you know theres absolutely nothing else to talk about 
Did you notice any pwm flicker on iphone 15 phones
 Congrats on charging ig  but nothing really new Once again Apple is just selling the name
Ive used iphones since 2011 and used to get the new one every year but in the last few years its been the same thing Last years pro becomes the new base and all they mainly change on the pros is the camera and chip Its really getting old and boring
Can someone explain why USBC is important Im confused Me personally dont care if its lightning or usbc or whatever Aside from having only one charger for all of your device what else
All i wanna know is where did he get that wallpaper
iPhone 11 Pro Max 64gbs user here so I thinking to make the jump to the 15 Pro Max Thanks for the great content Take care
Lets see how repairable this thing is when someone swaps parts between units and bricks them
USB C is not a next big thing from Apple but simply a grudging adaptation to laws that were introduced here in the EU to counteract the evergrowing flood of electronic waste No more proprietary charging cables If only portable electrical devices with replaceable batteries are allowed to be marketed here from 2027 Apple will most likely also sell this longoverdue Naturalness to its churchgoers as a huge innovation Apple is not only at the top when it comes to technology but also when it comes to propaganda er public relations
Going from a 12 pro max to a 15 pro max Main drivers are the new chip and battery life improvements The other thing for me is the new optical zoom and faster camera I use the optical zoom as an activity thing since my vision isnt great It lets me take picture of smaller text or distant text and read it easily
The back of my 12PM is broken but it costs too much to replace because apparently it would require replacing the screen too Im glad to see theyre finally addressing this in the 15 Ill probably upgrade and hope we continue to see them make their devices easier to repair
zero innovation since a decade
Oof that intro wasnt cut great
Good video but disliked for the Anker sponsorship Dont know if their brand will ever be something I trust again
Thunderbolt will come to the 16 pro next year
"Video title  Not just USBC

 Proceeds to list a few negligible features most people wont even use "
Ive been in camp dont care at all since the XS These all so minor generational upgrades arent swaying people to spend 1300 I hope Apple really goes back to the drawing board at some point to give people something unique next year This shit is getting old
I really dont get why people hype up apple so much
Just as expected Nothing new Dont know why people care so much about a glass and metal rectangle
I cant remember them coming out with a feature that I just had to upgrade for I upgrade out of need such as if Im out of warranty and damaged my phone or because its been 4 to 5 years on my current phone which is the case for me this year going from an 11 pro to 15 pro That said Im looking forward to MagSafe and upgraded cameras Bummer that the 5x telephoto lens is only available on the max Its too big of a phone for me
Every single apple related video has the most in depth informations and effortI wonder why dont you put the same energy into other phone reviews or videos hmmm
I am not getting one but the biggest concern coming from an iPhone 14 Pro Max user is that the 14s seem to have really bad battery degradation issues Ive seen on reddit posts many people with a phone that is only about a year old already under 90 battery maximum capacity I am still going to wait until the iPhone 16 or maybe iPhone 17 to upgrade but it is still frustrating that I may need to replace the battery in the current phone I have somewhere down the line because of the degradation issues
Im still on the 12 this shows me that switching again is not worth it and its useless Glad I grew up As a kid you just want the new iPhone
Its crazy and really inspiring for small tech youtubers like me that apple mentioned mkbhds quote about their products
I dont think the this announcement is big enough for me to upgrade The upgrades are less and less impressive these days And I simply have so many accessories that go with my iPhone so Im not inconvenienced by lightening at the moment Maybe Ill feel different once I do upgrade my iPad
Innovation is dead Makers will squeeze whatever they can from current technology and then move on Marquez is talking about keeping some of the accessories for a while implying that getting the new phone is natural Well it is not since there are no upgrades that matter even when comparing to an iphone 11 At the current state of things when my phone dies or I smash it or is too slow then I will get a new phone There are people starving on this planet Id rather make a donation
Apple playing catchup again What else is new
another meh no needs to change my 13
Excited for iPhone 16 pro D  currently have 14 pro max dont really see a need to upgrade
Great vdeo Congrats on getting mentioned on the event
If this phone didnt suck USBC wouldnt be the first thing people talk about Im typing this on an iPhone 12 and 15 doesnt have anything that I would upgrade for Feels like Apple has been sitting in their asses making minor improvements and collecting the dough for the last few years Feels  years behind the new Huawei phone with satellite call capability
I usually upgrade to a prior yearnot bleeding edge model and would love a 14 Pro when they go on sale but USBC is legit calling to me Except that I would be the black sheep in my allApple house who are all on Lightning still 
I was expecting 15 to be a big change Like they did with the X Oh well still happy with my 14 pro max bought because I figured it would be the pinnacle of its form
Trying not to be negative but honestly this phone looks so boring definitely wont buy it
Yawn Apple is so underwhelming at this point when it comes to iPhone I was expecting a tablet iPhone like Samsung Ill keep my current phone and spend that 1k on food
"Every time I see a video on these new phones and the camera I get depressed I used to be with a woman that majored in photography PHOTOGRAPHY It used to be something you could get a degree in Now everyone has a camera far better than the Canon Mark III with features that make them a more talented photographer than someone that spend years honing that craft 

Tip for young people  DO NOT major in something that can be replaced by technology"
I currently still have the iPhone 7 Plus so now that theyve transitioned to the USBC port I think its finally time for an upgrade
Contextual action button seems like a missed opportunity
Fast charging will be next year maybe But also I dont really miss fast charging my battery goes all day anyway
I wonder if the iPhone 15 Pro 128GB has limited ProRes recording like the 14 had  
Im really disappointed with the colors of pros this year
My iPhone 7 is finally gonna be replaced
The things Im excited about is gaming performance since you know Im a gamer  even though I prefer android I just love to see how new tech holds up with performance
340 Samsung and Pixel already has that feature
I was expecting them to put M1 in the 15 pro 
thank the eu for imposing the regulations about the cables otherwise we would have been stuck with the lightning god knows how long
The brand new iPhone 16 pro max would have what we need
French authorities have requested Apple to take this phone from the market because the radiation exceeds safety standards
USB 20 and its speeds were standardised in 2001 What the hell
I do not care at all The mentioned features are what us android users have had for years How these would get someone to upgrade their 14 to 15 is beyond me Besides Apple is so closed up I wouldnt even bother Unless it was just to say I have the latest iPhone
iphone is just scam now
i hate how they removed the lightning port that was like apples thing
iphone yesterdays technology at tomorrows prices
I remember the quantum leap in performance and features from upgrading from an iPhone 8 to an iPhone 12 Pro Max Not sure if I should get the 15 Pro Max or wait for the iPhone 16 Pro Max
"Lmao the biggest change headline is switching to usbc but still using usb 20 speed and no fast charging

Sad how the most advance tech company became a boarderline scammer nowadays

Plus usbc had been around 78yrs nowalthough only popularized the pass 5yrs but dang catching eyes with an old tech for a new model launch is a new low to me on apple Especially when none of the feature comes with it but one and only on the top modelwith a 99 increase from last years top model msrp1099 vs 1199

Oh and  i know im ranting at this point
1 That glass fix where its more repairable It was just absurd to begin with
2 They should have gotten rid of lighting long time ago as they break all the freaking time
3 This might be a lesser jump from iPhone 13 to 14 more like a tiny step not to mention they used to have leap years"
Still waiting on the s24 announcement b4 I make my decision
you do you knows lighter than the 15promax my iphone 13mini smug
"So its Iphone 12 Pro s sss   
Nothing new here"
I have a 13 pro max and Im keeping it  Its not enough  of an upgrade
Always to the point cutting through the marketing BS love it
Would love to get the 15 ProMax but I just got the 14 ProMax 68 months ago So Ill need to wait
Im still waiting for the day we can move apps wherever we want on the screen lol
about time they introduced usbcthinking there above the law all the time they only did it as they didnt want to make 2 versions for EU and all other as EU were going to proper sue them big time
Following with interest  however on Samsung S22 now and my next phone will likely be a Google pixel pro
Definitely getting one
Im just happy they finally swapped to a usb charging port every other phone uses Now I dont have to ask if they got an android or apple charger
so much echo
Keeping my 12 pro for now
Well I am still Not paying Extra to get the Dynamic island feature yet I will stick to iPhone 13 Mini for the next big upgrade maybe in the next 67 years I will be ready to try The Island 
Im sticking to Android
I wonder if thunderbolt data transfer and charging will come in iPhone 16  Pro perhaps
So the only exciting change is the USBC port which they were forced to add due to the EU legislation  Not sure we should be calling that an upgrade since its literally just adding the same charging port other phones have had for years  Disappointing
Where is the crimsonred Iphone15 pro  I was sooooo excited for that colorrrrr 
"I never get excited about new iPhone reviews are releases 
They are so boring and its the same old looking phone with a few updates that every other Android phone had for years "
The lack of fast charging is crazy to me Definitely intentionally held for next year so this years headline is USBC and next year can be Fastest Charging Ever in and iPhone
apple is running out of ideas what could they possibly continue to add on new iphones that would make people want to buy them at what point can they no longer improve the iphone
Cant wait for Apple to quote Marques next time with Its either something weve already seen in some other phone for years or its some ecosystem feature that only works with other iPhones 
Thinking of getting rid of my Deep purple 14PM just because of the Titanium finish and original Titanium coloralso UCB C
In 2027 all the phones probably will be with easy replacement battery Huge win for the customers
So the iPhone 15 is basically last years iPhone 14 Pro
But why did Apple switch to USBC Did they start listening to people and are trying to genuinely make their products more inclusive
those camera bumps are INSANE
Type c with no fast charging lmfao
Actually Not Even USBC
Really only the pro models get the new mute switch I have a 13 and Ill wait until theres no notch or island
If apple did usbc 31  fast charging how can they add it for iPhone 16 
I have the s23 ultra But I am going to buy one of these pro models for someone who has an iPhone
Not happy about USBC though I prefer lightning
Upgrade year for me Retiring XS Max and getting 15 Pro Max
Its time to upgrade I have the 11 pro max and cant hear on the phone unless its on speaker
Lol going to wait another year once again These incremental updates are not worth the price especially with a notch that big
Camp Dont Care 1
My iphone 8 dont get any updates anymore so i need the 15
Incremental changes nothing crazy to make a switch Family is on apple Ill stick with my s22 ultra 
Im not sharing my USB c cord with no iPhone user  better have they own
Its like celebrating a kid eating their veggies after throwing a fit for 10 years
So you just glossed over HARDWARE raytracing hardware raytracing in an iphone definitely means that M3 will have hardware raytracing MACBOOK AIRS WITH RAYTRACING
Lets just take a moment of silence for those People who watched this video when they cante even afford the IPhone SE
Holyshit its usb c guys holy shit so crazy and innovative and new holy shit guys
Im still rocking an 11 pro max  its slow as molasses and Im ready for an upgrade  Been waiting for usbc now its here now they can have my money again
"Very very lack luster Apple is loosing its appeal to me They couldve done soo much more

 In screen Touch ID
 moved the action button
 changed the camera layout location
 Created a foldable
 brought back duetone like the OG iPhone
 put some sort of Apple Watch Screen on the back for quick notifications
 A Notification light
 Removed the Dynamic Island holepunch but kept the software I like the software idea
 make the cameras FLUSH with the casing ugh this is a dream of mine straight up candybar lookfeel
 Improved the selficamera
 put a 2nd selfi camera in landscape mode for meetings or whatever

idk there couldve been a bit more on their side but were getting to the slow point of its just a slab and theres nothing more you can really do with it The foldableflexible displays are what is going to make phones fun again Mr Mobile reference    Thats where Android is going to shine and frankly I only stick with iPhone because Androids notifications are a mess and iPhones still just work  I had a Galaxy Z Fold and I loved it but the dimensions were trash and the software was lackluster if Google can figure out how to keep consistency on their software even windows figured it out then id be done with Apple Privacy is a bonus but lets be real here apple still reads and access your data on iCloud which is where your phone is backed up to"
Even Marques is struggling to justify new iphone  its just usb C
fawning over  sure
Apple pushing the boundaries of mediocrity
"Most Android phones still only have USB 20 speeds despite being USB C for a long time now Only some of the flagship phones have USB 3 but even then nearly all USB C phone charging cables are only 20 speeds anyhow

The Samsung Galaxy s22 was the first Galaxy phone with full 10Gb 31 speeds but still came with a 20 cable in the box I believe the s21s20 both had weird 5gb max speeds that got thermally throttled in under a minute So if you wanted faster data transfer you had to buy a different USB C cable I guarantee the iPhone pro wont come with a 31 cable but will likely come with the same 20 USB C cables that nearly all other USB C phones come with and no one has ever noticed"
I honestly feel like people should at least boycott iphone for 1 generation this is a top product from a 3 trillion dollars company  Very disappointed  I do like the new color though
They said they werent increasing the price but the price went up for every iPhone in Canada
This is why people are no longer waiting in line for the latest iPhone Tiny improvements that are not worth the investment for 99 of users Lastly I always find it amusing how much time and effort they put into the look of a product that is almost always going to be in a case
Just sold my 14 pro max and got for the first time a s23 ultra and i feel like Im really now on the future Apple still stuck on the same stupidity for like 7 years including the style of the phone biggest upgrade is the usbc 
I suppose you could say this is the third port change if you include the original iPods with FireWire
just saw a video on tiktok some guy admiring your red camera 
Def gonna get it the pro max
Action button  Samsung Bixby button Welcome to 2017 
 what was that shot at 15 lol Yuck dude
Its just 14 S like they use too bring s version nthin big change after 12
PWM Pulse Width Modulation probably is still an issue on OLED display But rarely any BIG  tech YouTuber talks about it Reason why a lot of people cant upgrade and use OLED display because of eye strain headache nausea dizziness
27 millie views in 7 hours 
Great Review  Oh well guess Im sticking with my 13 Pro max  No Waterproof feature on this model either  IDK if its been addressed but why not  Other phones have it  Come on apple 
Why am I secondhand proud of Marques for being called out on yesterdays Apple Event I dont know that man LMAO
im going to get one not for any of the new feathers or anything just because my wife has and 11 and i have the 14 so ill upgrade and give her my 14
"I think an underrated thing here is the impact of the switch to USBC on potential switchers  I have been on Android since the beginning and tried an iPhone for three months in 2020  but couldnt stand having to worry about that damn lightning cable

I am actually considering jumping ship now and i think there are many others that will too"
Just bought my 14 pro last year and do I wish I had back my usb c instead of lightning absolutely but its not worth buying another iPhone when mine works perfectly fine and I dont have a lot if not any apple accessories so its just my phone and a lightning cable so maybe in a couple of years Ill switch but right now Im perfectly happy with my 14 pro
3 nanometer chips is insane
"For me the highlight of the event was when Tim mentioned MKBHD on stage It shows how good and legit your work is 
Whats more impressive is that you didnt mention that in this video and it didnt really change you style about reviewing Apple 

Keep up the good work Waiting for the full reviews 
Honestly only the Pro Max makes enough sense to buy this year"
Good sponsor with Anker  Love their products
I do think its kinda weird how they advertise changing to USBC as their own revolutionary idea even though its just because they were forced to change by new EU rules
the iPhone 15 is slowly receiving tiny parts of things the s23 has
Im so excited about the portrait mode update I never remember to use the portrait mode Also still 60hz in the regular 15 seriously 
I saw a usb c cable adapter on 9 to 5 Mac
Im getting one coming from an IPhone xr
"Im not completely sold on the 15 I have the Purple 14 pro max Ill upgrade my watch I have the 7s Blah on the action button new chip usbc camera The 15 didnt really impress me If youre below generation 14 and maybe 13 Id say go for it the upgrade 

I will say Im excited for iOS17 and upgrading my watch"
I was waiting for your review Impeccable as always
Consoooom new iphone
boring colours all the phones are way too big to be honest Apple are going to have to do something extraordinary surprise this 13 mini from my hands Im basically gonna hold onto this sensible perfect size phone for long as humanly possible
So the camera takes ppls biometrics whether you like it or not
You didnt mention spacial computing 3d pictures Also will you make a separate video about that awesome watch ultra and the new gesture that will likely be a haptic compliment to vision pro
So does that mean iPhone 15 series can act as a power bank for older iPhones with UsbC to lightning
Is it drop proof
I dont care about the phone at all I just wanna know how the stock market reacts to the announcements
Camp upgrading from iPhone 13 pro ASAP Ill wait for a few 3rd party phone cases to become available and then pull the trigger
Im almost 100 positive they did speak about stronger glass and default focal length settings during the keynote
Finally USB C 
Im this time in the camp of happy that I switched to the s23 ultra Personally I would have been so disappointed waiting to upgrade from my 11 pro max Yeah USB C is nice and then I would get lidar as well but I have so much more with the s23 ultra and its spen plus good lock As an engineer and power user this phone is freaking amazing
Prob switch from Android to Apple just for Foreflight alone
Only Apple can produce a flagship phone with 60hz refresh rate display and no fast charging in year 2023
There you go people USBC with no fast charging All the junk yards eagerly await eating these interim devices Greed at the expense of people and resources
Do thy give charging block this time And thy are forced to go C Type charging it must heart that Apple lol
Apple has to piece meal the features cant give the consumers everything they want at once  fast charging will come in the 16 and super fast charging in the 17
I upgraded to the 13 Pro Max two years ago just for 120hz and it feels like I just bought it I doubt Ill upgrade for a few more years
Yawn yawn 
I wouldve got the iPhone 15 pro if it had the 5X camera as well but Im just gonna have to wait until next year
Want that USB 3 with 10 Gbps speed for Pro models Guess what Cable sold separately for 69 Only USB 2 cable included 
"The iPhone 15  Its like the last one just more expensive

 Apple"
dated phones
"I think there are a lot of changes A lot of them you are not talking about 
Ill definitely be going to get a Pro Max"
My iPhone takes 25 min to fully charge Never took an hour
Everyone seems to be ignoring the most important aspect  You can play full console level titles on your phone and if you purchase them through the App Store you can also play them on your Mac Apple makes great looking hardware but the focus is really the ecosystem
Anker is like your ex girlfriend from high school as soon you broke up with her Linus  Anker she gets together with your classmate who you dont really hate or like MKBHD
Damn I shouldve waited I got the 14 pro max
Ive had the 11 pro for years and Ive been waiting forever for something actually worth upgrading to and I think this year might finally be it 
Why do I feel like Apple may get into the gaming space
Boooooooooo iPhone lacks on design booooooooooooooooooooo
To the entire world comming from an European  Youre welcome for USBC
"EU usbc or no sell
Apple Fine but its gonna be low speed slams doors to his room"
As far as baseless speculation goes I suspect that the pro moniker for the A17 chip is more important that just a switch away from bionic What it sounds like to me is an opportunity to keep that exact chip out of nonpro iPhones next year and instead include a base A17 possibly to keep USB 3 out of base model iPhones for more than just 1 generation
The fact that he had to explain USBC to apple users 
Does it feel like youre holding a smaller phone when youve got the 15 Pro
I dont like the action button They should have added the button somewhere else not take away the mute switch Now you cant just look at the side of your phone to see if its muted or not Im getting the base iPhone 15 upgrading from a 13 mini I hope the keep the action button on pros only going forward
Yu are heavily paid from apple for sure
i just know he wants to launch google assistant
Im rocking an iPhone XR thats starting to show its age in a number of ways so for me this feels like a perfect time to upgrade I can collect all the incremental changes of the past 45 years and jump from lightning to usbc all in 1 go I think for people in my camp who have held off on upgrading for so long this is the perfect iPhone to finally make the plunge
iPhone as usual is garbage
Rob Jobs We are at it again
You are the best
Upgrading from the iPhone 8 Plus
MKB you said theres still a few Lightning accessories like MagSafe Duo and AirPods Max but literally every AirPod is still on lightning wym
lols typical CRAPPLE limiting the speed of USBClols
iPhone is boring
What is the new of this iPhone model  it was a boring  event
Lighting is better because they do last better than type C
I phones for dum people 
How long do you think well have USBC before they go portless cause I was kinda thinking they wouldve gone portless this time cause that wouldve been the loophole they couldve used to not put USBC on the iPhone
I keep going back and forth Had the 13 max pro switched to Ultra 22 and now honestly looking forward to switching back to the 15 pro max I am a project manager for a general contractor and I take lots of photos and upload them to our PM software I also do a little graphic design and create small pieces of content for our social media accounts I find that I prefer apples echo systems the most I hope this time it sticks
Now I am waiting for Samsung to finally move on to more premium materials The 15 pros titanium build and the software support really make it a 7year phone and that is what I want Lets see when I change phobes in 2027 what everyone is offering
Cant wait to see you test them out
Not gonna lie this was a super lackluster reveal If it wasnt for the fact that Im 3 generations behind I wouldnt be switching lol
Apple is silly Do something that should have been in the phone but charge a new pro price
Buy if you guys have 12 series or less otherwise just for few small things its not worth to upgrade 
Tomatoes Tomatoes Youve seen them once youve seen them all
"The one feature that has always been on the iPhone that I love is the way they do voicemail instead of the standard voicemail because I can do everything with voicemail easier on the iPhone

The reason I will never go back to iPhone is what Apple blatantly did during the time the Chinese protested their government and Apple literally forced updates and removed all forms of private communication to the point of not just disabling AirDrop but removing it all together Their locked down ecosystem runs smoothly but very easily manipulated by people in Apples back pocket during times of their unfavorability"
give me an iphone 15 mini please with usbc
Bruh y would they replace the mute switch it was so useful and u can just look at it to know if ur muted or not
"this sounds too positive for basically nothing new 
The glass is now more slightly more repairable Come on how low are you placing the bar"
Pretty disappointed with the phones very minimal improvments theyre pitching as a huge upgrades I found the series 9 watch more interesting than anything i saw in the phone
Watching this on my iPhone 6
Vision Pro Spatial Video will become the most important reason to buy the Pro Max  I think being able to create content for Vision Pro will become a sought after business for pro photographers and videographers People will want content for their very expensive new toy  Also if you can afford a VP you will want to capture videos yourself
Sorry just not ready to throw away all my cords for a lackluster apple installment Ill switch over when they have a more innovative phone Save myself 600 until iPhone 16
Thank you Europe for prompting an unreasonable tech conglomerate to make one very reasonable change
iPhone14s
Apple pretends like its their brilliant idea but its been a thing for YEARS You will still need a specific Apple charger so you dont bottleneck your charging Real brilliant stuff Apple Maybe come up with your own ideas
Such a disappointing phone
Delta one
I dont understand why changing one charger type for another is exciting to some If your kettle got a new cable would that make the product better
And still no back button
Seems like Apple is running out of ideas with an old design phone I am predicting a new phone design in the near future
Wait I havent kept up with iphones or anything for a while now but why on earth do they still have that ugly ass notch thing at the top What the heck
Im considering upgrading from my 11pro as its battery is currently rocking 80 capacity Dont really care for usb c as I charge wirelessly but having same port as IPad is ideal
Countdown to the first anodized with 9V batteries iPhone in 3 2 1
I believe that 5 year gaps is the best time to upgrade Has the most wow effect These apple incremental upgrades dont have enough swing I am still rocking iPhone 11 max Email browsing whatsapp YouTube all work the same on all the generations I have missed Which is about 90 of the world main drivers in my opinion Even camera changes are meh But high five to all those getting new iPhone 15s
Superb video eva
The hype didnt match the reveal Apple is still years behind Samsung on hardware
Dynamic island is a hole in screen a bullshit
Hay marques you know Apple mention you in their presentation
WOW Iphone 15 with USBC now Steve Jobs must be so proud of Tim now  Who would have thought Apple can come out with such a brilliant idea 
Still not convinced to leave my iPhone SE 2nd Gen for this well see
So cryphones have finally got usb but its only 2 that doesnt fast charge and finally got a customizable button on some models has it got a headphone socket or a back button yet
Why no Stage Manager for the iPhone Pro Really hoped for being able to plug it in and connect Monitor Keyboard etc via a USB C Monitor Feature is already nice on iPad and with those Graphics I dont think the M1 is necessary
Does anybody knows how Preorder works  Im landing to US in few days and I planing to buy 15 Pro But how to ensure to get one if few first days of sell
The colors they add to the base models I wish they would add it to the pro version The new colors are boring this time around
Its a Europe requirement Come 2024 all devices need to change to a usbC
This was the most disappointing iPhone launch event in my opinion For the first time in a decade I am seriously thinking of moving on to something truly innovative and not just old wine in new bottle year after year
Terrible update Great video MK
Lol iPhone pro max plus giga and it lags during the task manager 1119
Disappointed but will upgrade from my 11 pro max
Im currently torn between the iphone 15 pro max and the pixel 8 pro so Im gonna wait for the google launch and compare the two Photography and cameras are so important to me
Difference in USB c 20 to USB c 30 material cost is maybe less than a dollar absolute joke
Look how he justifies the lack of any hardware upgrade since the iPhone 11 Bias at its best example 
"Great video 

Is it worth to upgrade from iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max "
NO MORE APPLE PHONES FOR ME I will never buy a iPhone ever again  Ive been a iPhone user since iPhone 3g to present  Samsung s23 ultra kills these clone to clone ever year  Its sad man apple has no more creativity
"even iphone introduce vibranium frame the screen will still break lol 
guys remember to use usb 31 cable new iphone only comes with usb 20 type c cable"
Why he always say peas at the end of his videos I dont get it
"Im waiting to see if that new portrait mode feature that can be added later will be ported to the 14 Pro  Pro Max they have the same chip so the same ISP
In the past they were some features that were reserved to newer models because they officially could not support it because they lacked specific hardware and that was debatable what will happen this time
Plus too bad I cannot use Shortcut to mute my phone this feature is only for the 15 ProPro Max The hardware switch button is tied to this function but an option to disable it completely in older iPhone and give this feature to shortcuts would have been a huge bonus They could also give us the opportunity to use the actual mute switch to other features with dual positions orientation lock for example
I hope indie dev will work on those kind of things once the iPhone is opened to alt app store in Europe"
Ill probably stick with my 14 pro max for another year Im really glad theyre going to USBC and that honestly almost gets me to get one because Id like to charge all my stuff with one cable but the other features while cool just arent enough of a leap to cause me to upgrade
A17 pro is a jawdropper The fact you glaze over realtime raytracing and neural enginegpu upres and upscaling is crazy This iPhone Pro is basically a gaming pc with a Nvidia 4060
This is gonna be my first Apple product since the iPhone 5c
Does the 15 series have the same battery capacity from the 14 series
All the same
Talk about a trash lol I will never change my phone again smartphones are dead
Way to go yall released the same product again
Can you move a Home Screen App anywhere or is that still restricted
I think Apple really showed how salty they were that they had to change the port Think about how much fanfare and explanation inpresentation they gave the switch to lightning or the removal of the headphone jack or the addition of MagSafe But here they glossed over it with a few sentencesI think it reaaaaaaaally did rub them the wrong way that they had to make this change 
Im really just waiting for reviews to see if I should upgrade from my 12 pro max
Still using my 12 pro max and not having any issues Ill probably wait at least another year to see the 16 Not enough in the 15 pro max to get me to turn in my 12 that still does everything I need it too
104 one piece is real
USBC  hallelujah
Great breakdown and well meh
I enjoyed seeing apple quote MKBHD and iJustine
Iphone users i dont care im buying the same phone every years as long it have a apple logo on it
Just sitting back and curiously watching the gap between Apple and Android become closer
New usb type c port but 20w charging speed on a 2023 flagship Seriously Lol
USB20 speeds from a USBC device in 2023 is honestly embarrassing
To be able to adjust the focus feature after shooting in portrait mode is useful especially for casual users Preconfiguring the zoom length to a desired shooting distance is perfect for casual users who are not experts and wont want to fiddle with settings that are intimidating for them In the future I hope that AI can be used with those built in sensors on the phone to create exciting features on all smartphones including iPhone Going this route I think can actually make newer phones more exciting to buy  No fast charging is disappointing 
Iphones   
Next gen portrait  its laughable Pixel has been doing it since 2019
You forgot the lame 60hz
I just want phones to stop being so expensive Great review as always I have the 11 and while I love tech a phone is a phone to me so idk if Ill upgrade Might ride this one until the wheels fall off
Three guesses why Apple added USB C to this phone clue I doubt anyone will know the real reason
"Looks nice Considering getting the pro Mainly for the fact that its noticeably lighter cant stand heavy phones Usbc is nice considering I have a samsung also 
And that new customizable button will be helpful 
I found it hilarious that the lady announcing usbc had the nerve to mention all of our other devices had usbc for years 
I still have this thing about Apple that I hate how they awkwardly sort of pretend to be God and act like apple products are like crack and you cant live without then and their so life changing
The mother nature part of the event had me laughing the whole time because of how awkward it is 
Nonetheless Im considering it probably in the blue color which was a great color to add 
I just hope performance is better 
I had the iPhone 14 pro when it came out and it overheated and dimmed the screen especially while gaming far too often and quickly which was a big turn off 
Seems like its worth a try Will probably keep my samsung s23 ultra as a secondary phone for media gaming and photos on my downtime Unless I like the iPhone enough this time
Also depends on the camera performance as I struggled to get good selfies with all the previous ones"
Ill be waiting till the 16 A year of phasing out Lightning and phasing in USBC will make the switch a lot smoother then
I have been waiting for an USBC iPhone for years but I dont think spending this much money on a phone is acceptable But my OnePlus 8 pros software drives me crazy
27M views in 7 hours  
Im in Camp I have Apple Upgrade Program but will likely just stick with my purple this is key iPhone 14Pro Max this product cycle
It is basically the same phone from last year I used to watch all YouTube videos about new phones and now its boring
still rocking 12 pro  nothing worth upgrading
I hate that I have to lose a feature just because I dont want an iPad in my pocket The only differences between the Pros should be size and battery life
remember it was forced by Europe to have the iPhone in USB C port
I think its more about the lack of usb support in the a16 chip Plus speed is not an issue for most ppl Its all cloud based or airdrop based
Way to go the same phone
Also made in India and costs 30 more
iPhone 14 Pro max has the same hardware of an iPhone 1515 Plus Why not the next generation portrait feature is left out from iPhone 14 ProMax I think they should bring it for both the iPhone 14 Pros Whats your thoughts
Bruh the 15 are literally 14 pros without 120hz but slightly better battery life Same chip same cameras same dynamic island No one should buy the 15 
So do they give you a charger since theyre changing the port Or are they still cheap and making you buy your own charger
"Im planning on getting the 15 Pro Max Hopefully the new design makes it lighter but Ive been disappointed in the 14 Pro battery life Need something that will last all day and the better camera on the 15 Pro Max looks nice 

Also it was really cool to see you quoted onstage in a Apple Event Congrats"
Amazing that usb c even matters havent plugged in since iPhone X
i have the 12 pro max but i dont know which one to get 15 pro max or 15 pro
Lmfao So you pay a bomb to get USB20 speeds Great iSheep are amazing tbh
Shut up and take my money
Not worth it for me upgrading from 14 Pro Max Ill be waiting for the iPhone 16 Pro Max Theres many things Apple couldve added but they saved it for the next generation like they always do
O
Ill stick with my regular 14 No reason to upgrade for what I use a phone for
If Ques aint excited about it Im not excited about it
Imagine if apple implemented usb years ago like they should have it would have forced them to innovate this year Now yall realize why they waited they saved it for a lackluster year so they actually had something to offer
"I havent had an iPhone since the iPhone 5 I think I might dip my toes back in the pool with this one 
Its going to feel weird moving away from the Galaxy line but I really havent found a better phone than the S20 FE 5G"
Always my go to source for everything tech So great Marques got mentioned by Apple
Currently on iPhone 13 Not sure Im tempted to go to the 15
zzzz boring
yeah im switching to android f this i was hoping for touch id to return bye apple nice knowing ya
I assume you will also FINALLY be able to turn silent mode onoff through software Which means automations on a schedule etc Being a hard switch the only way to do it before was manually
And we havent got an M2 iPhone
They saving fast charging for iPhone 16
Marques may not be pregnant but he always delivers
Sorry but nothing buying this time
Im going on my first overseas trip next spring so Im definitely going to be trading my 12 mini in on a 15 Pro Max
I think imma upgrade my 11 to the 15
Its ridiculous that they keep the crappy lightning port until they are forced not to and tout it as a feature  DUH
Waooooo this thing is not a big deal
Have we passed technology peak Its just redundancy atm
Should i buy this or the samsung 
Apple is getting really lazy with design SAD
This was the most underwhelming iPhone releases of all time
iPhone 15 pro max will be the last phone I wil ever use Dont know what can be changed or upgraded from that
I just set up my pre order for a new blue Pro Max Excited
Cool
Im getting one of these  Due for a phone and only consider 14 pro as an alternative if they are significantly marked down
same shit different case and of course usb c  
How much of these new features do most iPhone users actually care about them And how many people who care about the features already have an android phone that does it possibly better
My iPhone 11 my phone no payments does pretty much same shit as 15 dont be a sheep
Yea Ive got my 15 Pro build ready to purchase Friday Good bye iPhone 13
Eh apples dropping the ball honestly Nothings changed dramatically or at least they havent done anything noteworthy with iPhone for a long time
 iPhone 15 isnt all that
Hmm why would Apple give us thunderbolt off the bay when they can add it down the line the apple way 
I missed the iPhone 14 pro and it seems to me but Ill miss this model too sorry but I dont see something new Sorry Tim I wont give you the money
15 PRO  usb3  15  usb2  thats a lol from apple why not thunderbolt4usb4
As a 14 Pro user there isnt enough here to make want to swap in fact its taking 4 years for Apple to make me feel like Ive been left behind and Im really comfortable with that
2 hrs to charge your phone is nuts I would think the phone must be broken
"So the whole point of the Iphone 15 is null
The moment i heard TypeC i figured Fast Charging now i can actually buy my first iphone how do one go from a 80w charging phone to a 20w charging trust me youll definitely notice the difference"
I have the 11 pro right now and im not to sure if i should upgrade to the 15 pro
Waiting for agent 47 durability test
EU banned Lightning port back in 2022this is just a response to it not Apple innovating or wanting to make any changes
Im in camp I have an iPhone 11 with 73 capacity battery thats been waiting for an upgrade The Pro Max sounds so nice but also do I need a phone that big the 15 is great because its just about a 14 pro 15pro may be the sweet spot Well see
Thoroughly disappointed by how small they make the upgrades and willingly leave out logical upgrades for another year  like 20gbit transfer speed and fast charging Its 2023 for Christs sake  you really want to wait ANOTHER year to come out with the big announcement no article iPhone some number higher than 15 is now the fastest charging iPhone ever woohoo
same port and they only did it bc Europe MADE THEM DO IT it isnt special and isnt worth what they think it is
Its crazy how in a matter of years 56 years the tech industry went from inviting zero independent creators like MKBHD to Apple quoting Marques in the segment for MacBook Air
I have iphone 14 pro max right now I think i can comfortably skip this generation Iphone 16 where you at
I havent had an iphone since the 7 Since then Ive been going with notes and Samsung ultras I am a UX designer and my whole team makes fun of me for not having an iPhone Mobile development design revolves around IOS first foremost Well Im tired of android and its bugs Alot of apps and Im speaking of  big apps like Amazon are not visually optimized on Android  dont believe me turn your s22 or s23 ultra on landscape while on amazon youll see that the corners where the camera is are rounded Meaning they are still stuck on the note 9 screens Iphone here I come
Still 60 hz
sponsored by apple
Long time viewer of this channel This guys is becoming kind of apple hater lately I miss the neutral MKBHD
Me watching iphone 15 review with 0 in my account
iPhone 16 will probably get fast and 17 thunderbolt cause lets milk this
USBC 20 From the year 2000  Go apple lol
At times criticise smaller companies for smaller inventions that arent perfect and praising literally no invention that much baised is this tech tubers
Im five generations back on iPhones I was going to take the plunge into getting one even if there were no changes to this years generation I feel like Apple has lost their collective spark on innovation though
Sooobasicaly they launch 1 new phone per year
Always interested to see whats new  but never buying an iPhone
me watching this video knowing well i wont buy it
But i hope they change the glass at the back i guess some of us dont need em
Each year these new phones get less exciting Its quite a bummer if you love tech
Active cooling would have been a cool addition 
2 hours to charge Im seriously thinking of switching from Samsung but mine charges in like 4050 mins Is there a way to charge it faster or does the battery last all day
I just wanted more zoom like Samsung phones 5 times seems like a ripoff Ill wait another years
010 Lightskin MKBHD
But seriously given the small improvements on Apple Pro Maxs Camera every year I hope Apple would consider to make a Mirrorless Camera and DSLR I am interested on what is their approach
Ill be getting the new iPhone but Im a bit disappointed that basically everything that was announced didnt get me excited The new features and titanium are cool but if I didnt have the iPhone Upgrade Program I wouldnt even bother
nah just an USBC 30
1259 Im in camp Watching this is the only thing I can afford from the new iPhone lineup
Oh yeah congrats on the shout out at the event Well deserved
i guess phones are now really dead
Will we get 90hz in iphone 15 and 15plus
"Watching this on an iPad with Airpods on
Apple users wont really understand nor will Android users"
Im glad they put the definitely less expensive action button only on the Pro phone
Im worried that the new mute switch can be pressed accidentally now even if it has that delay  the previous button was almost impossible to accidental activation   but was possible to get stuck with small sand particles sometimes 
Just wondering is Apple not allowing people to say that they switched to USBC because of the EU regulations I just watched the video and looks like MKBHD is avoiding to say the EU word 
What a ridiculous phone  Just buy the S23U at a discount or wait a while for even more crushing camera features next year The Spen and DeX transformed my vision of what a phone can be and do
Cant decide between the blue and the black pro max
Its crazy that the main and biggest changeimprovement this year is something that Apple was forced to do Makes you wonder what wouldve been the highlight of this years phone if that wasnt the case
"Judging by the Camera pump size and lens thats never gonna be the same sensor as the 14pro

On the 15 it feels more like something similar to an IMX766 what is found  in the realme 9pro Moto G84 Nothing phone 1 just slightly cropped


I mean not that exact sensor but a sensor of that 1156 Size I expect 116 because just 48MP"
My jaw dropped when I saw the type C
In getting it regardless cuz i have the 13 pro max so i want to upgrade
Its funny how Apple and other companies worry about how the phone looks as far as the colors go when 999 of us put some time of case on our phones which hides all of the physical features they concentrated on
I just wanted to take a moment to say how amazing your video was I was really impressed with the quality of the footage the editing and the overall presentation You did a great job of explaining the topic in a clear and concise way and I learned a lot from watching your video
iPhones have been the same since iPhone X from 2017 obviously with slight improvements diameter changes hw upgrades camera upgrades yes its not quite the same phone BUT Apple to me used to be about massive innovation and since iPhone X I havent seen any in Apples phone department Not saying there should be a brand new mind blowing innovation every year thats probably next to impossible However if you look at iPhones from IPX to IP15 then the user experience would be the exact same yes you get better everything photos performance etc But the jump from iPhone 8 to iPhone X was much larger than the jump from iPX to iP15 perhaps the same as iPhone 5s to iPhone 6 So in my eyes if I tone it down a little and say whats the difference between iP13 14 and 15 Id say nothing at all except for better cameras the average user wont feel any difference Iphone 11 still takes good photos So whats up with this boring lineup Why not just introduce an iPhone Ultra or something new Its the same phone for the past few years boring
So glad that lightning port is gone which used to be only used by Apple and profit from it is gone and they can not profit from a port
So happy to see the switch to usb c Now my wife can lose all of my cables too
"Thanks a bunch 4 this very interesting informative and HIGHLY PROFESSIONAL video I totally agree with You that its a bummer that apple didnt reduce the charging time But for one the battery is usually very good regarding the screen on time for example my the longest battery life on my 11 Pro Max was 15 hours and 38 min which means even though it takes VERY LONG TO CHARGE it takes long until You need to charge it again The other point is if You got a cell which is fullycharged in under 30 minutes I wonder what the health of this battery after a half or a year looks like
I cant imagine that a battery which is being charged with that speed to preserve a good battery health over a longer time 
Greetings from Helvetia "
Still no Pro motion on 15 Come on Apple
"For those in the blissfully ignorant minority complaining about how all of Apples crap isnt USBC with the new iPhone  are lamenting the change 

Stop it 
Get some help 

From my perspective youre the clown  
for drinking the Kool aid FOR SO LOOOONG 
and diving wholeheartedly into ONLY one ecosystem

Steve wouldnt want this 

True freedom is when you can diversify  build your own technological ecosystem instead of being pigeonholed into the emotional capitalist abuser castle of human psychological neglect seed of mental illness Pyramid scheme that is Apple

However the iPhone itself is beautiful Nanometal fusing
The god Hephaestus would be proud 
Such beauty brings tears to my eyes 

If only she wasnt tarnished by the disappointment that is Apple

Looking back through history of how your company has run things 

You have disgraced
Father time 

The Wizard of Woz"
I will be getting the 15 pro I currently have the 12 pro and will be passing that along to a family member I think the titanium looks cool USC is welcome and I like the action button a lot I never use the mute switch as my phone is muted all the time Thanks Marques you always give us the real and concise scoop
Kudos to MKBHD for trying this hard to mention so many new already old features Dude literally explaining USB C type and Post portrait mode like its a new thing
Dont forget the spatial video capability in iPhone 15 so that you can create 3D video for the upcoming Apple VR Headset
I love my iPhone 12 Pro Max absolutely notbing wrong with it finally payed it off actually to be able to upgrade so imma be getting it no matter what this time lol
Marques you really need to call out Apple on that speed cap There is no reason to do that other than pettiness
Main feature is the USB C Wowthat blows my mind literally
Making the rounds to my brothasUrAverageConsumer and now MKB
Marques didnt even acknowledge his shoutout during the event lmao You know youve won when the biggest tech company in the world includes you in their event
No point to upgrade
Another boring year from Apple Ill stick with my 13 pro
This dude is marketing Apple like its 2023 and apple just invented USB C and its the first time in this world he is seeing USB C Hopefully one day people will see your unbiased review of Apple Truth is Iphone 15 line up is overpriced garbage
"I think that the wildest thing is the phones can only support 20W but the cable that Apple is selling is 240W
And the only cable that they sell that supports the fast enough speeds for the pro phone is a thunderbolt 4 pro cable that cost 70"
"Bye Bye Lightning Connector

Welcome USBC"
I cant believe you are using those headphones to fly There are a couple of much better sounding ANC here going around
Not really impressed with the titanium build I feel like the main upgrade is in the base models this year If you have the IPhone 14 upgrading to the 15 is definitively worth it but USBC might be the only reason to upgrade if you already have a 14 pro other than that I wasnt really impressed
Nerfed USBC Nice move Apple No super duper fast charging option like Samsung or Xiaomi 
Yeah Im getting one for the type C port Goodbye lightning cable garbage
Same shit with tiny updates Not cool
Just a guess but what if they changed the name of the chip to pro is because theyre introducing a max chip with the 16
That pink version looks insanely dope
Can I use iPhone usb C cable with my Samsung Adapter
The Sony Xperia 1 Vputs that iphone 15to shameJust my opinion
Steel is better  stronger by volume Yes heavier but stonger Titanium has half the strength but also half the weight by volume Titanium has a lot of give So if the kept the same width of bezel then titanium is better as still would have given simlar rigidity due to material width But making it thinner titanium flexes way earlier than steel
"Nice recap Im in the if someone offers me 800 for my pristine 14 Pro Max Ill buy it camp 

Im more interested in Apple getting all the critical patches into iOS 17"
Im honestly just wanting to get it because of the usbc Id like to use the same chargers for my AirPods iPad and iPhone altogether but the look of the titanium does look really great to me
Looks the same as the old ones 
Faster scrolling yeeee
The One Piece is real
Not worth it maybe next year
i can live without fast charge It makes the phone warmer and degrades the battery faster
"And why TF hasnt apple figured out how to put all the camera settings in the camera app itself  In this day and age why would you need to leave the camera app enter the absolute train wreck system settings to make your change and then navigate back to the camera app

Whoever is in charge of that stuff should be fired  Today"
100 getting it
Its sad that they leave the baseline with usb 2 speed  Specially for users like myself for downloading videos from sd cards from my cameras or drone
Should I upgrade from 12 mini
1019 They said on stage it was due to space limitations but theyve said that before like with Sensorshift and added it to next year Pro model
me still on my iphone 6s lol
Cant wait for apple mfs to start calling usb c cords apple cords
Question doesnt focal length depend on the lens That 12x is just a crop isnt it Does the lens move or something Afaik calling the zoom levels as Xmm focal length is just bait
I wonder if Airdrop is going to be any faster with wifi 6E
Got an iPhone 8 Plus Still works and everything but starting to feel like I should upgrade iPhone 15 worthy
Your impression is way more interesting than the product itself
Coming from S21 Ultra Im super excited to get this phone
meh woudnt say this is HUGE but at least now they finally joined everyone else with the universal standard of USBC
"20 watt charging An hour and a half

Im on a really old Oppo Find x Pro2 here  even this charges at around 6070watts fast charging I think 

20 watts sounds weirdly slow you sure thats right"
CONGRATS on the Apple Event shoutout Marques   From the Commander and Chief himself less no less  Well done lad
"Still dont like the fact they they still has larger bezels compared to what samsung is giving


Edit just noticed the pro models has slightly thinner bezels"
So Apple added a Bixby button hmm
Going from 13 Pro to 15 Pro Max
LMAOANDROID DID ITive been using my side button as a shortcut to my camera for literally yearsand using usbC as a talking point only after being forced by the courts is actually funnyApple has not been inovative for over 30 years now Offering people several versions of the SAME phone is GENIUS though
One of the biggest underdog features that got me by surprise is the dedicated AV1 hardware decoder Thats absolutely huge for both users and also a much welcome push for the whole AV1 ecosystem and broader adoption
Not impressed at all It makes you wonder if anyone in that multitrillion Dollar megacompany has one bit of imagination for innovation Everything they showed is basically irrelevant to the common user
Im using an iPhone 11 Pro 256 GB and honestly I dont see a single reason to change it to a new iPhone I will probably get a new battery and wait another year to see what Apple shows next time Especially since my current ecosystem is lightningbased I have so many ready lightning cables around me car office nightstand etc as well as other devices such as powerbanks so this will work just fine for the next year

Nice Review You are always on point focusing on what is important and what isnt
Its literally the same phone of last years packaged in a new chipnamed different apparently with the USBC which was again due to EU regulations So no new biginnovations this year 
Coming from a base iPhone 12 I wonder if the 15 pro is a big enough upgrade 
Not impressed by the updates to the new iPhones  The wowexciting factor from these events is gone
They added USBC because they were forced to but they did it in such a way that it is still crippled with the same 15 year old transfer speeds that Lightning had  And 20W charging over a wire  Other brands have had 30W and even 50W wireless charging and over 100W wired charging since last year
Ordered 15promax today Switching from iPhone 13 USB c is nice to have and those higher transfer speeds are great but I would be ok with lightning Interesting how the battery will last with the 3nm cpu
CIGAN MODERUJE VIDEO
This is soooo unimpressive to android  usersthese are features weve been using for yearsbut so new and fantastic for apple users yayyyyy
look i cant afford this things but i really enjoyed your videos weird 
The new design are what people are fawning  Thats a joke right
Im holding on to my 13 Mini until they come out with another model under 6
As an android user this is one of the best new features Ive seen in iPhones for years FINALLY When I ask people for a charger I wont have to be disappointed when they only have a lighting one
Given that theres a feature difference it would have made sense if there rumours had been correct and theyd call it Ultra instead of Pro Max which has always been a dumb name Would make it clean 15 15 Plus 15 Pro and 15 Ultra
iphone camera is batter all of camera phone i think
"038046 So basically what Android owners have been saying for years lol
Edit USB 20 transfer speeds with USB C So this was literally just a port change Also no fast charging Next years iPhone selling point Now with USB C fast charging "
You missed the biggest surprise in this event which is apple quoting you in their presentation lol
I think its overpriced for what you
Easy skip
Why do ppl bother upgrading  Software is all same so
old lady phone what a joke
Lets be honest we all know they were not gonna include fast charging they petty 
Love the details SPEC TALK KING 
One of the things I instantly appreciated when I bought my iPhone 4s was the mood switch I use it multiple times a day just to feel that the phone is muted I already hate the action button
USB C is much more better and convenient
Appreciate It  My Xr may need replacement so trying to decide whether to to go this year or wait  If I go then which model as photographyvideo is important though I do have a DSLRbut always having it in your pocket is very convenient  Your thoughs in your review would be appreciated
USBC Better late than never but still it is 2 years late to party an action button that most will use as a physical camerashutter button This sounds SO Nokia WIndows Phone Again Late to the party No debate that Apple couldnt have had these items on PRO level devices over the last couple iterations and could have included these 2 features with the same level of execution and detail as they have done everything else Apple just continues to nickel and dime customers
"I will wait for some reviews I have a xiaomi mi 11 now almost 3 years old Feel like after having a phone with so many annoying bugs and Xiaomi bloatware  Xiaomi killing standard features for third party launcher apps its time to move back to apple 
I think I will get the pro or pro max 
The only thing is I dont know if I can justify the 250 euro price difference 128gb is enough for me"
"I bought the iPhone 14 Pro 256 GB last year
Im not one of those people who switch up their phones every year I had an iPhone 6S before and Ill definitely stick to my 14 Pro for years to come until it doesnt support any more iOS updates
Until that happens Im excited about how the iPhones will change and evolve in the upcoming years
The iPhone 1515 Pro brought a few very nice things and Im definitely a fan of it and hopefully theyll bring more highly anticipated changes in the upcoming years"
Every time I click on a thumbnail with iphone on it I get to see a samsung ad at the beginning of the video 
I think they held back on new fast charging for the iPhone 16 Im sure they thought about it but of course they gotta save some stuff for the iPhone 16 Especially with iPhone 15 being the first with USBC
Same pop
15 not getting high refresh is a bummer
Will the mini ever come back 
You missed the 3D CAMERA LIKE INSTA360
I watched the Keynotes and when any of the presenters talked about a new feature I asked myself would I actually use this feature Most of them I said no the only one that I said yes to was the phone call feature of taking away all the outside noise When they presented the camera processor and chips I thought the same old stuff nothing new Still glad that I switched to my S23 Ultra
This was the least anticlimactic apple event as far as I can remember The biggest update was just a USBC port change
Absolute nothingburger of an updatedifferent metal so what  usb C they had to do it New coloursSo what Chip is 10 fasterSo what for 999 of users Oh wow you get a special button to do a different one thing other than mute it 999 of users will leave it as a mute button Go from 3x to 5x zoomSo what its not exactly a huge difference and is anyone bothered If anyone has an iphone 121314 pro they wont feel the need or desire to upgrade so iphone arc is still on a plateau of pointless innovations since 12pro
Consumerism at its finest  Next
I always find it funnyfrustrating how big a deal Apple makes about the appearance of the body Doesnt everyone immediately slap a case on their phone Ive had my current iPhone XS Max for 45 years and rarely take it out of the case
Something I think you glossed over the Pros can record directly to an external USBC drive I guess thats really only a benefit for filmmakers content creators  the like but it could potentially be a gateway to do much more
It was so cool to see them mention you in the live event
Bought a 14 Pro Max a week ago Im not fond of type C so for now I went with the most recent lightning iPhone I could find
If you have the 14pro there is literally no reason to get this bs   Ill keep this until its paid off
I guess im waiting another year for maybe the 16 all of these crazy prices for a barely changed device sounds a bit rough
Sorry Apple I just jailbroke my 13PM a few months ago Ill see in 2 years
If USBC is the biggest news for the iphone this year thats pretty sad More of Apple doing less
iPhone 15 got better upgrade this year than pro One thing that doesnt make sense for a flagship in 2023 is 60 Hz screen
not worth the money if you have a working iphone already
Apple is literally running out of new things to add for iPhone and its funny to watch 
welcome to the show of  Cant Buy But Still Watching 
Odds on horrendous sales for the 15 phones then as this has got to be the most uninteresting phone release ever First time in about 12 years I wont be upgrading
No aways no display Oh normal iPhone 15
In the box only USBC 20 cabels Apple will sell USBC 30 cables separately 
Came here to learn about Spatial Recording but not sure it was covered 
Its crazy that my nearly 3 year old now 500 S21 Ultra is better in every way except for chip and display brightness 
"But lets be honest not everyone is a power user Not everyone will discern the difference between a Pro phone and a nonPro phone in terms of transfer speeds or the material used in the chassis Some people just want a phone that works well and doesnt cost a lot of money In my opinion iPhones are deliberately designed and thats a positive aspect its not being afraid of change its being intentional with it

People often overlook the littlest details such as Apples efforts to make their products environmentally friendly which in a small way contributes to our ecosystems wellbeing For an introvert the little things matter lol

In conclusion not every product suits everyones needs and thats why theres a variety Theres androids and iOS theres Unix and Linux etc"
iPhone Upgrade Program for 8 years  Im stuck in camp Im getting a new phone no matter what haha
why samsung wallpaper
"thanks for this video
Not enough upgrade for 15 pro The winner is  pro max because 5x camera  I hate 15 promax because of the size so i wait to iphone 16 or 17"
They need to add a  close all tabs feature
action button for games
New charging cable button instead of a switch Apple  Think differently
No new fast charging is a major disappointment given the introduction of USBC What a missed opportunity Would love to know why
kind of disappointing that there is only 4 colors on the 15 Pro15 Pro Max Titanium Black gray white natural and Blue They could have easily done that Dark Red color that people were leaking earlier on We got that awesome Dark Forrest Green color for the 13 Pro Max and that beautiful Dark Purple for the 14 Pro Max Anyways Im still going to get the 15 Pro Max because Im with Marques weirdly I like the natural color the most
I predicted the PINK Barbie  Phone color I am wondering if they have caught up with Samsung Androids 120 hz refresh rate yet but 
i dont give a shit about actually owning an iphone but i love hearing news about them its like gossip for nerds
"For some reason I dont feel convinced  I will wait for the 16  Hopefully it can be charged psychically  Lol

228 This is dumb  Why would i want to waste my phones juice to end up with headphones and no phone I am good  I will stick doing it with my portable battery pack

Ps  If you listen carefully all you hear is Little change herelittle change there  In other words Let us all wait"
Not impressed with the upgrades at all If it wasnt for IOS
I was quite concerned about the evolution of computer chips This iPhone 15 Pro comes with the new chip the socalled A17 from Apple This chip features a new technology the 3nm process from the Taiwanese giant TSMC It was expected to be something monumental in terms of advancement however Apples new chip turned out to be only 10 faster than the old one And the battery performs the same as the 2021 version the iPhone 13 Pro Max with the A15 chip Sadbut its our reality
Definitely in the dont care at all box I just purchased the iPhone 14 pro max had my 12 pro max for years that was solid Thought it was a bad decision on my part to upgrade with being so close to the iPhone 15 pro max release but after seeing this video and the apple eventnothin stands out or so big of a change I have to switch So well see what happens next year
How is the repairability 
I switch from android to apple every two years but i think il just stick with my s23 utra for now till the iphone 16
Watching from my couch on Android island 
You all act as if the Galaxy lineup changes each year
A very very small upgrade
15 was a very good number but wasted with this They should have named it 14s
Is there really a new camera sensor compared to the 14 pro Specs look identical
idk who you are but I thank to you random guy in europe that had an idea to forced Apple to use USB C on iphone 
I have a xs max was really hoping for some redesign on the 15
same damn bs staying with my 13 pro max
Throttling the USB C data and charge speed is absolutely ridiculous and a explicit FU to its users and to Europe
I have a feeling for the first time ever a lot of people arent going to upgrade Especially if they have a 1314 I think everyone is catching on and the 15 sales wont do as good as previous years Ive seen more people than ever say Im switching to Samsung lol
Why not 14S 
"WOW 
Its got USBC Several years after all the other companies Impressive Ha ha ha"
No improvements on fastcharging And yet the Chinese phones seems to be able to get this done
You can also charge an Apple Watch via its USBC cable from the Iphone 15
From a photographers standpoint I really wish they would add an option in the camera settings to switch the zoom display from the 05 1x 3 etc to actually show the focal length I just dont ever think in terms of arbitrary zoom magnification I think in terms of focal length and for all their marketing to Pro users you would think theyd cater to Pro terminology And I get that it comes up when you long press to bring up the zoom wheel I just wish I could have it display all the time
Marques getting name dropped was the highlight of WWDC 
I like the new action button but all Ive ever really wanted from my iPhone is what my OnePlus2 could do back in the day I want a switch with 3 settings Completely Silent Vibrate and Sound on 2 options has felt limited ever since
Apple is like US government They say we are revolutionary but other companies are more revolutionary than that lmao
Does the new mute custom button only allow one change Or does it have various options like multiple times press options or holding to do at least 4 different customs setting in one go
Currently on a 12 Pro but still on the fence about whether I should upgrade this year or next year as I like to use my phones for 3  5 years Definitely looking forward to your more indepth reviews as Im looking more towards the Pro Max if I do decide to upgrade this year Keep up the great work and kudos for getting quoted
Im upgrading from a regular 11 I want the larger screen but Im not a fan of any of the Plus colors So with only a 200 difference between the 256GB Plus and Pro Max its a no brainer for me and that Natural Titanium is gorgeous
Apple purposefully pre install software that seeks green clean energy to charge via USBC Forcing issues of plugging in iPhone XV whilst at 10 Forward of EI8HT 8 hours then you awake  with still XV  at 10
RIP Lightning Port Youll always be the original Apple iPhone port
I got more excite about Apple quoting you then the iPhone 15 
Ive had the same phone for a while I guess Ill upgrade so I can take better photos when Im overseas later this year
That black colour is nice iPhone software just craps all over android software  I give them that doesnt need 120hz Check in feature etc damn android get with it
Isnt 20w fast charging 2 years ago we were still getting the 5w brick lol
My humble suggestion to Marques is to reuse your past  present iPhone Impressions videos for anymore Iphone launches  No difference between previous versions and to new versions 
I dont understand why they dont go all out stop taking baby steps and give us what we want and needcharging sucks I would rather have faster charging then titanium sides or the side action button what a waste
They only introduced USBC after YEARS of delay due to MASSIVE EU sanctions and in fear of new ones They had been following their consumeristic approach of having different connectors which caused millions of units to be produced and resulted in a significant amount of pollution Despite the greenwashing they did as seen in the last keynote it is unlikely that they will be able to clean up their act anytime soon
Im currently using a IPhone 8 Plus  I think it time guys to upgrade this year 
Theyre surprisingly relatively more affordable in the UK
Your wallpaper is amazing from where did you get it Plzz replyy 
Dude how did Marques have a worse take than Linus
I Appreciate the overview and unbiased review but Im just not impressed at all I would of been more impressed if all the rumors actually came true Im just going to keep my Green iPhone 13 Pro
"That ultra satisfying click it makes when you connect a lightning cable to the iPhone is gone 
I didnt notice the matte finish during the event
N I C E"
"I think it will charge at a max of 30W 13 pro max does 27W max and sustains it decently well
At least Apple doesnt LIE with bullshit 45W numbers like Samsung does"
Bro dont matter what Apple releases youre going to always be biased You should be saying that its atrocious that it took them so long to put USBc And even worse that they are promoting it like WHAT If any other android phone did this youd be destroying them The fact that you got quoted says enough you are paid by Apple such a waste
"Silent button will be missed and i think it will be a good reason why people will move from iPhone Its just looking more and more like a Google Pixel or Samsung even more with the USBC
I am reconsidering if im keeping on Iphone or not"
Do you think its worth upgrading from 13promax to 15pro max
I feel like this is an obligatory video He really tried to make this exciting but there wasnt much to say
Do you think theres a reason they didnt use anodizing for color They mentioned it on stream and I feel like it wouldve been super cool
Still nothing more about being able to side load apps from 3rd party developers
Im going to say Im not the target demo for this new one I got the 14 pro last year and I think Ill keep it til the last software update Unless I break it
Why does Apple always use glass for its covers  Why the shitty screen that breaks just by looking at it  When are you going to put an amoled display
Titanium isnt stronger but its more flexible and resilient Some would define it as tougher but the absolute strength is lower than steel
A real disappointment
the Matrix is real people buying this garbage is a big proof
Nah Im gonna skip this Ill probably buy the 17 when it launches
Not sure I want to upgrade from my iPhone 14 pro but I am tempted if I was to change to the pro max Im also happy they have brought the price back down in the uk the 14 pro is more at the moment  
This new Apple 15 is a joke   48MP Camera  Filming in 4K What
What is about iPhone that people buy it except they are overpriced Maybe photo or video quality But for games Who buys phone for gaming
This years release looks solid just one more thing why the nonpro still stuck at 60 Hz Im so used to the 120 Hz but only the pro get it which i dont really need 
"Apple forgets two things every time
1 Innovation 
2 To create product checklists"
I feel like if youve bought the 14 lineup youre good til next year The titanium body is cool but its notworth it
USBC 20 and USBC 30 60hz on all screensReally  Apple  In 2023 BTW not ONE word on the front cameras throughout the event meaning no advances
"Really sad to see how little Apple is willing to add to new generation of iPhones every year
The features are good to have but not mind blowing
Probably will need to see if the camera system can convince me to sell my Mirrorless camera and lens Otherwise not much point to upgrade from an iPhone 12 pro max"
One cable to rule them all and in the darkness of your backpack bind them
Marques whats going on with your hand Whitening up as you age or what
I have the 12 pro max Im getting the 15 pro max in blue  next weekend 
"As an iPhone user who doesnt blidnly support Apple I like this iterations where they just perfect what they already have instead of inserting new gimmicks I guess I will be getting the base model iPhone 15 upgrading from iPhone 11

Thanks Marques for the indepth early look into the iPhone 15"
ICT7PM Sept 13th 2023
as someone who used to do board level repairs on iphones I am curious to see just how repairable it is The back glass is great I miss the iphone 4 days of swapping out back glass quick and simple However the fact that they integrated the USB controller onto the CPU could mean unrepairable by the average repair shop USB issues because technicians cant replace the U2 charging controller as simply as they could on older models Its been a while since I have done board repair admittedly but this really stuck out to me when watching the keynote
marques seems dissapointed lol
Finally I can upgrade lol
ya im getting the 15 pro
USBc is jiggly trash that will increase landfill Octavia will not be pleased  apple 2030 will fail
That after photo portrait effect HTC M8 had 10y ago
MKBHD said subscribe more times than he said iPhone in this video
Whoever has anything nice to say about this years iPhone has been paid to do so
Its amazing that the most talked feature is one that every single smartphone already have
"Im using Anker cables and power banks for years now ABSOLUTELY AMAZING

iPhone 15 PRO MAX is AMAZEBALLS this year"
You seem really depressed with this new iphone Guess ill skip this generation
Good time to upgrade from the 12 pro max
I watch pretty much all your videos and somehow this doesnt feel like you My best guess is they paid marques to not compare the iPhone to any other phones Their policy is to compare iPhones with only iphones Now mkbhd did the same here
Why we cant coment on the new Iphone 1515 Pro ad on the Apple Youtube Channel its becase on the new ad Introducing iPhone 15 Pro  Apple 326 sec if didnt notice the swimming pool is the 3 rings Samsung Galaxy S23 Camera  LOL  Other thing Samsing has 200MP and records at 8K Apple 15 records at 4K 60 fps Its a joke
in the last few years I noticed your views are softened toward big corporates and real good or bad towards small tech makers cmon you are not on the payroll
I got a 14 pro so theres no chance Im getting one But I definitely do care Feel like that is a valid camp to be in as well
I got the 14 rn and Im ngl Im happy with this 14 sure its no different yt neither is the 15
My enthusiasm is really paired how committed I am to the gardeniPhone 11 Pro plus   A watch 7 so had MACs been with touchstylus  be all in so for now Surface Pro and an iPhone  and watch  cross roads going back and forththe Windows Surface Pro downer is battery  life
My first phone was an iphone 4 i bought it on olx Then when i was of age i bought the iphone se 1st gen used it for 55 years and when i could afford to buy a new one i bought the iphone 13 from the flipkart sale The best thing about it is that it is built like a tank and would last you for years to come And to me the customisations are not a big part about the phone rather the ease of use which made me incline towards the iphone That sums up my faith in the product  
Yawner this year
Yikes  editors I had to take my volume from around 50 windows volume to 18 a bit loud no
iPhone 15 is the same as iPhone 11 only thing changing are the cameras 13 pro max was the best since 11 because the 120hz  But mainly all the same since iPhone 11 same shape same size and they still have the bump on the back stop spending money on the same phone over and over make them really upgrade these phones to actually be worth it Seriously a button on the side to customize fast action  I thought that was why I have a touch screen and hey siri    save your 1500  this phone Isnt worth it even if you had a million extra dollars
Lackluster eventApple iPhone is a joke
I actually think the lighting connector is a superior design than USB c Easier to clean less likely to break USC c has that this little pin connector in the phone and I always think it looks fragile Lightning had its connectors flush around the inside of the port and the connector had no chance of getting debris stuck inside Things can easily get lodged inside the usc c connector USC c should have taken the design of lightning
I dont care for usbc because I wouldnt fast charge my phone using iPad or MacBook charger to protect battery life Always 5W charger which makes me use separate cable anyway And I have no android phones to be worried about connector type But I do like the idea of making things more consistent across the board and across the platform
Boring phones
Imagine the people bought bang olufsen speakers  bose  beats  all those expensive Speakers with lightning how do they feel about the change 
The fact the 15 is barely different at all and they didnt even change the look it still looks like the 11 like dang bro apple rush through making phones I always wondered y it comes out basically every year
My provider has a program where you lease a phone for two years so I will probably upgrade this year  iPhone 15 pro max is in the lead But I am open to see what is happening with pixel
While the addition of the action button is certainly welcome it seems like a really obvious missed opportunity to not have multiinput customization support for it Being able to customize it to do a thing with a single tap is cool but they could have so easily allowed it to do something different with a long press and then another thing with a double click or any number of other options Just a thought
Love it but I wont be upgrading this year Currently rocking the 14 pro max and I just dont see a real reason to upgrade this year But it does give me a few things to look forward to come the 16 
"Apple the biggest company in the world mentions Maques

Marques So anyways this is the new iphone"
Camp no need to change Im depth detailed review great job
"I see what Marques did with the sponsors segment 

Thats from LTT"
Disappointing event tbh
only apple can upgrade the charging port and sell the same phone as a new phone
"Android got USB C in fall of 2014
Apple  lets wait 10 years to release this "
IPhone is confused 
You have an amazing wallpaper on thumbnail Where do i get it Can anyone recommend me an app or site with high res wallpapers without grain
"Mkbhd trying really hard to hype this up 

You can use this cable to charge your airpods with your phone"
Samsung flip is much better haha
What bums me is that theres no adblockers on any browsers for iphone
Wow is the same phone with software upgrades
Will we be able to connect a usb c dongle to the iPhone for Ethernet usb 30 hdmi
What do you think about the new PVD Physical vapor deposition coating on iPhone 15 Pro I know this coating from watches and I DONT like it When you scratch it you see the real metal color beneath it and its really ugly So its now coloured through and through
Im honestly relieved fast charging isnt a thing It just destroys your battery faster
If you use the action button for something other than switching between silent and ringer on how would you then switch between silent and ringer on
409 next year it will be iPhone 16 Pro Cell Max 
Definitely not upgrading from the 14 Pro Max I could see why people who are on the 12 or earlier would update But I just see minor and one major update Plus Im not ready to move my iPhone to type C Also the 14 Pro Max already has the dynamic island so Ill blend right in
Im in camp 23u and never going back
Funny how so much far ahead Samsung is but people just love Apple for being Apple lol
Iphone ran out of ideas this is funny 
Im just happy to never ask for iphone charger ever again
Should I upgrade from 12 pro max
Main takeaway Just USBC About 8 years late
This was an overall L I cant lie
Apple people hate Android but yall keep copying us
The A17 SoC is 3nm Qualcomm and Samsung are aiming for end of 2024 and 2025 for their 3nm tech so this is truly a case of Apple having core technology a generation ahead of the completion and another iteration towards the end of Moores law The jump is from 16 billion transistors in the A16 to now 19 billion thats enabling the more advanced neural engine and claimed GPU boost Its a SoC like weve never seen before this is what makes Apple stand out and the advantage of owning their own silicon has Its not all hype the core tech is enabling it to deliver what they promise
Im so glad I wont be able to use any lightning connecting device I have such a good feature wow
I guess I will keep my 14 pro  Nothing new
According to the new iPhone landing page I THINK at least the newer Pro phones have faster charging About a 50 charge in 30 minutes
Mi biggest gripe with the action button is a missing icon in the top corner that tells you that your phone is silenced Looks like you need to buy an Android phone for that feature  In fact the ipads have a shortcut in the control center that lets you mute the phone and it doubles as an indicator Lets hope we get the same toggle on the iphone To me that action button is kind of upsetting I use the mute switch constantly and I spent years with a OnePlus so I really grew up with a mute switch 
Titanium is not stronger than steel Its stronger per a gram but volume wise it is not
The iphone 15 type C charging system is giving Android
I havent watched the full video yet but I need to ask Does it support 33W of charging
If you look back at iPhone 11121314 Pro Max the 15 looks 99 the same on the outside
Curious if USBC charging ports are harder to keep clean I regularly clean out the Lightning port on my iPhone as it collects dust and lint from the pocket Its easy to clean out But USBC has that center pin I imagine that will be harder to clean out ifwhen needed
Still holding onto my 12 Pro for now   Aside from the battery starting to give its a solid phone  Is this making me want to change   Mehhhhhh I dont know  Would you
apple been whining about zero emissions and carbon footprint nonsense but still release a new iphone every year  wish apple release a burnt orange color
BRO I JUST WANT TWO THINGS FROM APPLE RN THESE ENGINEERS NEED TO MAKE LANDSCAPE MODE AND FOR APPLE WATCHES HEART ZONE ALERTS IT REALLY AINT THAT HARD APPLE ALSO NO ONE IS USING IPHONE AS A GAMING MACHINE NO ONE WILL PLAY RE4 or RE5 OUTSIDE HWNE THEY HVE PCs
Apple junk
So marcus is not hyped of new pros
Nothing has changed it would have been better if they hadnt released this piece of crap
Apple was FORCED to change to USB C by Europe And Im glad Its about time I dont use Apple but for the users it shouldve been USB years ago
This is paid review and everybody is jumping out of their bed Innovation is dead on iphone 
I dont care honestly Its boring
So can you map the button to ask Google assistant through a shortcut
So the new iphone is a glorified S20 lmfaoooo
A periscope camera thats what
you know its not a big upgrade if the headline is the USB C cable
Well I have an iphone 13 I guess pro  I might prefer a mini  I dont use the camera on the iphone much  I do like the ipad pro  I wanted an ipad mini pro but I guess that wont happen  I think it was required by the European Union to have USBC connections but Im not following things too closely
That action would be a good shudder button
I guess a new Siri feature or Siri service would be cool its in the phone now But what new things can Siri do
If there is less material on the edges now made of titanium you are essentially getting the same amount of strength as the bigger stainless steel older edges Titanium is stronger you can use less of it to get the same effects Thats how the phone is lighter So same net strength lighter phone
Iphone 8 Plus user here Now I am gonna upgrade to a used 12 Which most probably I am gonna get in 200 bucks 
Its just the iPhone 14 with USB c
Iam at iphone 11 pro max now  Will be swapping to 15 pro max for the better camera and will keep that phone for 45 years atleast since they will not update the camera that much for the next few years i guess
So basically the same phone
I always wait a few generations so Im saying goodbye to a 12Pro and my wifes 11Pro
Apple website says 10x optical zoom on pro and 4x optical zoom on regular 15
Thank you for break down This really helps
are androids the only phones coming out with massiveimpressive upgrades every year this year was weak with iphone Maybe they will come out with the iphone fold in 2027
Honestly Im almost tempted to drop Android  make the switch to Apple Holding out to see what the Pixel 8 lineup looks like then Ill decide what to upgrade to
Sweet glad I got the 14 was able to get a trade in deal and I prefer the lightning bolts durability vs USB C plus lighting bolt market will likely crash offering cheap charging cords
having usb 2 on a 800 phone is a joke
lets wait for the 16 then lol
I really liked Anker products but I bought a charger that broke my wifes hearing aids charger twice Moved on to UGreen
Basically just get Samsung
Im just hoping the USBC will open the door for third party developers to design 4k clean hdmi out for the iPhone That would be sick
Its quite funny to see you guys praise such small things and try to make them like they did a grate job New button  new body usb C welcome to 2015 bro
Longtime android power user on my first iPhone 12 that I bought the day it came out on a whim when I needed a new phone to try something new I genuinely do not think this upgrade is worth it but I want USBC so bad Im probably gonna buy it anyways
Useless
I just got a 14 pro max but Im going to trade this in for 15 pro max
So sick of this lack in innovation on iPhones  All they do is to change things ppl dont care about Had all iphones since 5 till the 13 The usability is exactly the same since Still cant do the basics like split screen multi app integration etc etc etc Nobody cares about your faster chips
Its time for me to upgrade just need to decide whether I want the 15 or wait until 16
While watching a video about new Iphone a samsung phone ad pops up The worldSorry youtube is getting crazy 
"Im not to impressed honestly 
I feel like Apple has conditioned people to just except their small upgrades I was really hoping for a fingerprint scanner like the Samsung S23 
I was also hoping for the Apple 
logo on the back of the phone to actually light  up "
Thank you for the initial review I plan to upgrade from an Iphone X Yes ancient
As soon as they add fast charging I might think about going back to iPhone If u know fast charging u know
My only dissapointment is that iPhone 15 has a 48 mp sensor but they still wont let you take Apple RAW pictures I guess its nice 24mps compressed pics are the default but still
YA YA ALL GOOD BUT HOW ABOUT AKNOWLEDGING THAT YOU WERE TOTALLY WRONG ABOUT THE USBC PORT U ALREADY FORGOT U DID A WHOLE VIDEO EXPLAINING HOW THIS WAS NOT HAPPENING OR YOU HAVE THE MEMORY OF A GOLDFISH
Apple should introduce a17 and a17pro chipsets
Still no 10x optical which samsung had since 2013
Im rocking my iPhone 12 for now  Maybe when the 16 comes out Ill get one
The pro doesnt support power delivery
I think apple is going to eliminate usb C soon and go just to power magnet 
I dont know why Apple put the USB C the iPhone 15
Lease of my work phone is going to expire summer next year So I definitely am going to get the iphone 15
Upgrading one of my iPhone 14 Pro Max to the 15 Pro Max but not enough new features to justify upgrading both my phones But USBC while not groundbreaking will be a huge convenience when traveling
"Can the action button work as follows  Is yes Nice If not Why     

 Hold to mute like old mute switch by default 
 double click to do anything else For example open camera"
I just want to know if I can edit video from my R5 directly from an external SSD
Crazy thought but Apple keeps new models looking exactly like the newest old phone so people who still have the old phone dont feel too jealous of people with the new one since asttetics are the same
Got an 11 it still works Was excited about moving up to a pro model but theres literally no reason to spend 1000 on these minor updates  which is actually a good thing Means theyre making these phones last a little longer
I really think that the new chip in the Pro Max is the biggest feature That will enable a lot of features that havent been available in the past or were at least crippled in some way
Do the 15 and 15 plus get 120hz Pro Motion display or just the regular 60hz with dynamic island
A nice change from Apple but we know the reason Besides they kinda change a bit here and there every year without a break through so no expectation from me
"usb c working at usb 20 speeds lmao hahah are u serious

who buys that crap"
Buy cobalt stamped with apple logo its crazy how people turn themselves into ads
Im getting the 15 Pro Max I wish you could set it to default the camera in 5x thats where I take the majority of my photos
iPhone 15 is basically iPhone 14 2023
For the first time i m feeling that Marques is trying very hard to prove that iPhone15 worth upgrading
As an Apple fan its getting harder every year to be excited about these releases What am I gonna do though Use Android Android is incredibly sloppy
"Not even a hater of iPhone but it has gotten insanely boring I dont even know how YouTubers find the way to stretch it into a 10min video everytime I remember iPhone used to make an overhaul every three generations 
It has been since X that I cant even tell them apart"
I never will use apple products 
Well I upgrade every year so doesnt matter
use to watch u when u made reviews on the note 4
On my second year in a row to just keep my iPhone 13 Pro Max  Nothing too beneficial to switch over to just yet
also ive noticed that the iphone 15s have a brighter display than the 15 pro and also the 14 pro it seems that the 15 pros have the same peak brightness as the 14 pros at 1000 nits typical however the 15s have a 2000 peak brightness also with the pro phones they didnt mentoin basically anything concerning the display idk it would be weird if this was actually the case
What is your colour for the new iPhone
No thanks waiting on the S24 Ultra in January now
Holding back real updates to keep consumers hooked Should have been more Quality of Life features Ill skip this generation
Apple need SD card and card slot no dual Sim needed but SD Card is must
idk if i missed it in this vid but i need to know if they changed anything with the smart hdr or whatever feature it is that auto adjusts every single photo i take bc thats so ANNOYING
The video is good The phone is a yawn
I believe Im done with apple I really like the s23 ultra
Apple should start giving an adapter to USB C and be done with it They can call it iDapter and charge it overpriced as all they do
This was the video i was waiting for 
Apple really missed a trick by not using magsafe as objectively the best way to charge the airpods while including reverse wireless charging If theyre going as far as to allow charging from iphones why not omit the need for a cable
It looks so different OMG its a revolution for the industry
USBC would be nice to have as would the dynamic island And the zoom camera But Im sticking with my 13 mini The huge screens doesnt give the users any real benefit there are no more apps to be viewed on one screen no split screen modes etc
Time to go get a Z fold 5
Will they ever bring in pro mode manual mode for the camera lol It is just software part and I guess it will be a welcome feature for many iPhone photography enthusiasts who now rely on third party apps Still have to carry around a lightning watch cable and so on so not going to switch from 13 pro max
I thought that  each iPhone 15 would have the signature of the Uyghur slave who assembled it emblazoned across the back of the phone Is this not the case
You can thank EU for USBC in iPhone USA had no balls to force that
It is surreal to look an iPhone  and see usbc ports
He noticed how flat it was looking out the Plane window
The USB C thing is thanks to the EU legislation 
Does the audio on this video sound more processedrobotic than usual Or just on my phone
"Chip is faster
Reuse eco system gimmick
Titanium firm still glass back what else lol"
TB is reserved for future releases  its Apple
Also what is one x It is not a focal length I get that it is something like a 2627 mm focal length or about there but I dont know every phone by heart if that could be mentioned especially when it is a higher end camera in a phone  world that be sweet Not a complaint just would have made more sense to me and been easier to understand
Nothing exciting not that one should be for a launch of a new iPhone anyway
WOW looking nothing like the 14 I am so AMAZED apple you did it again 
Im 75 sure that i will keep my 13 Pro one more year I like the 15 Pro Max new 5X zoom and weight In fact the weight was the first reason i got the normal Pro the 13 Pro Max was 240 grams  Also i like USB C but i can live without this one more year About charging speeds i never fast charged anything If its under 130 hrs for me its fast enough Since i give my iPhone to my parents usually when im upgrading i care about battery health and i want to not replace the battery every 2 years
Id like to welcome Apple to 2014 
I recently got the 14 pro Should I switch it out for the 15 pro or just wait for next year
bringing up the real point with the fast charging disappointment  i also expected that
Camp dont care at all tbh
It is confirmed    iPhone 15pro will come out with 30 Watts fast charging This is HUGE UPGRADE
Unless you got an iPhone 7 pass on the upgrade
"Naming the A17 pro seems intentional Next year they may probably come up with an under powered version of A17 pro and name it as A17 and use it on base line iPhone 16 

It would be a pure devilish apple move lmao"
Innovation is dead
For a basic phone its not worth it better to buy something used
Almost evry features they added are features I enjoy for 7 months 
10 years later its still look the same lol
Its the same phone its insane actualy I think Im gonna by myself a 13
You cannot fool us no more these are merely incremental improvements hell you cant even tell if its a 14 pro or a 15 pro front or back 
Im gonna miss the mute switch not gonna lie
Camp waiting for the SE
"Colors are horrible already new the usb c was coming 

At least people will buy it means I still have a job"
They didnt make the action button more customizable  LIke double press or triple press  long press vs short pressetc  Seems like an oversight considering the button is customizable  Why wouldnt they allow more flexibility
Hey folks time to ditch apple and move to the better OS Android
Dont even waste ur time reviewing these stale phones
I am still looking at my iPhone14 Pro and desperately trying to detect a few significant differences to use as an excuse to buy the iPhone15 
Mid phone tbh kinda disappointed
Will the 15 pro be the FIRST Apple product that will play full 24 bit 192 kHz high resolution lossless music Due to the non retarded usbc
So happy apple is moving to USBC Yes the were FORCED by the EU but Im still happy
Finally USB C  wait not thunderbolt   kinda boring  Same phone different colors  
You can think whatever you want about iPhone but you will still get one
I might get the 15 to replace my 13 mini
Thank you Europe for forcing apple to use rhe usbc
"Watching this on iPhone X 
Still a great phone I own it from 2017"
For the same price it is a good deal to get a titanium and usb port Dont care about the new chip since iphone 11 is still fast enought
Imagine if they had included Stage Manager Extended Display Support ala Apple Dex on the new Pro Max Oh and also fixed the name Ultra instead of Pro Max For comparison the Galaxy Z fold 5 can be purchased for only 400 more which has better multitasking with faster charging plus Dex
I do feel like the current team at Apple are absolute followers in the industry Wheres the innovation I dont feel like theyre pushing the industry forward at ALL The most interesting aspect are full retail console games coming out natively for the phone but this was always going to be the case whether the Apple Silicon and Apple Metal API
So happy I changed to a Samsung s22 ultra
011 marques in his bad B era 
you are an agent of apple
Wow so crazy wow So many new things  wow Look how different this model is compare to the others  Wow amazing
Its just  iphone 15 which worth buying this year
I was interested in the regular 15 but 60hz   i might as well just wait for the 16 or 17 and see whats up
So Im upgrading from 12 pro just cant decide which one I want iPhone 15 plus or iPhone 15 pro max
Samsung s24 ultra would be more amazing than that
Theres absolutely no innovation anymore You guys cant tell me youre excited every time a new iPhone comes out when its basically the same phone you already This phone is crap and will be bought by crap people
Action Button is launching FanDuel
"Its bananas that for over 5 years even Samsungs sub 400 entry level phones and many other entry level android phones have USBC 3 with support for connecting to an external display at 4K60 Samsung has included DEX to give users a full screen desktop view without having to rely on wireless Apple is finally forced by the EU to use a standard port and cable technology and Apple goes out of their way to intentionally gimp that functionality on their products that are less than 900

And before everyone claims that the data transfer rate doesnt matter on a device that everyone transfers files wirelessly Id argue that you do it wirelessly because thats the way Apple wanted it you had little choice Transferring 150GB of 4K video over wireless compared to using even 10Gb USBC with the flash SSD storage speeds we have available on modern phones and laptops is night and day most people will average about 50MBs over WiFi or a tiny bit faster over lightning yet over USBC 32 I often get over 1000MBs from phone to laptop And Apple just limited the nonpro models data transfer rate to USB 20s 60MBs welcome to the year 2000 Apple"
Cant wait to the new iPhone get jailbroken  that action button will be sweet for the jailbreak community
I was mostly impressed about the gaming capabilities of this phone but no one is talking about it
Rocking my 12 Pro Max and I really dont see enough to upgrade to the 15 Pro Max just yet I feel like if I was going to upgrade the 14 Pro Max would do just fine and save a lot more money all these minimal changes dont really add up to getting a new phone every year like they used to
Its literally the same phone
iPhones jumped the shark years ago Theyve become so boring 
"Of course yall will hype it 
Its a nothing burger that cost more than the previous nothing burger"
Will there be new laptops this year
When will apple give curved retina display
Apple devices are just boring Extremely good but boring
Finally switching from 6s to 15 
The Lightning cable is like an FBI stripper from the Sopranos
I was waiting to hear about the next iPad lineup  The phone changes are cute and all but I dont see anything that makes me want to drop my 12 alongside a pile of cash   Theyre offering trade in deals but I dont know if thats enough  Do you know if and when there will be an announcement about iPads
I think the chip is A17 not A16
You forgot to mention the most important upgrade in the 15 Pro Max which is that the camera stabilization system is 3D You didnt mention the most important upgrade ever on an iPhone good job guys
The heavy and solid feel of the steel frame was one of the few last pros iphone had
Only Apple could get away with introducing a feature that was adopted by the masses in 2016 as a new flagship selling feature in 2023
This makes the s23 ultra look 7 years behind Samsung should just give up
basically same shit every yearthe dont work on making the phones better or cooler they just come up with new ways to brainwash and how to trap more people into buy only apple stuff  THE APPLE ECOSYSTEM
Ew Give mute switch back This is 10x worse than losing headphone jack Just a downgrade
"So last years pro model basically becomes this years base model and the new pro gets some upgrades and both get USBC  Nothing ground breaking but a nice incremental upgrade for those with older phones  About as expected

But of course annoying raging nerdboys are gonna scream OMG wherez duh innovations like they do every year  At this point these phones are mini computers and can do almost anything you want  Most of the innovation comes with software these days not hardware  Not sure what people are realistically expecting other than incremental upgrades  faster processor better cameras etc  Youre not gonna see the giant leaps any more because they do so much already  Expect the same from Samsung and Google later this year

All that said I think this is a good upgrade if you have an older phone but if you have last years model probably not worth it  I think people who upgrade every year are ridiculous anyway  Just my 002"
Since Steve died tht Iphones been the damn same shit I would neva get an android but come onnnnn give us somethin different
Im getting fed up with apple Dont care at all
I think apple doesnt fast charge to preserve the battery long term but Im also disappointed about it 
Could have mentioned that USBC isnt in this phone because Apple is so generous but because they are required by the EU
Apple had to move to USBC because of EU Law Still locked out from fast 20w charging unless you have a Apple licensed cable and charger Which weve already been able to do with USB MicroC via QualcommSamsung methods in a 4 pin wire Safety issues Come on Just a money grab for accessories again
Lmao same phone same shit every year
Titanium is not necessarily better stainless steel is less fragile and rigid which could be a good thing for impact protection and to sort of cushin a hit
There is nothing amazing from 14Pro to 15Pro So Im in the dont care grouo
"Just down plays how android phones been using USB c for around 7 or 8 years 
He just said laptops been using them for a couple years
Getting a little biased"
"Please suggest me 
Should I opt for a upgrade from iphone XR to 1515 pro 
Or is 14 pro still good coz that can save me few bucks"
Why does it feel like his rate of speech changed 
They still intend to get your money Id say  dont see a reason to get any iphone there are many smartphones which are better and cost less
The main issue with reviewers is they come up and set lenses through which others should look at the phones and they tell people what they should think Subtle but still
fast charging on iphone 16
Will definitely miss the ringer switch
"Next year We are adding SD card to iPhone 16
Video title its not just SD card
Extent to which people go to save Apples failure innovation"
My iPhone 12 pro is still chugging along nicely Not enough of a change just yet to warrant an upgrade
iPhone 13 Pro Max  Still not enough good stuff to compel me to upgrade
The Samsung ad on this video is just 
Im so hyped for the iPhone 15 Pro Max in the colour Natural Titanium 
so tell me Marques why should I buy this new Iphone this year
Its just an iphone 14 with usb C
Girl all I care about is is it faster and do the battery last longer tbh Considering I have an ancient 11 pro max I think Ill just get the 15 plus
Such bullshit hardly no new changesI cant see myself buying the 15 when I have the 13And its pretty much the SAME PHONE Apple trying to screw their customers again
Apples idea Already developed so many features but making products lazily thats why serving features yearly 2  r 3 very very lazy updates Already all of them are stored in their lab
Basically  Samsung
Apple is loosing its edge I havent seen them this lazy with new releases
i use a CASE so the way it feels dont matter 
"My only interest in the iPhone is the camera
Specifically I recently took a photo with a friends iPhone 12 and the photo was shockingly better than an image from my Samsung Galaxy S8
I want to buy the phone with the best camera Is it the iPhone 15"
pixels r useless Thats why Samsung is the best purely cuz of the air tag and Samsung tag tracking Airtags are the fastest most reliable in emergency situations when you lost your devices and you need to locate them immediately Google doesnt have any of this or speed for lost Google devices And pixel is subpar vs Samsung phones tbh Google phones dont even have an AR based ruler app like iPhone and Samsung thats the shittiest thing and theres no other app on playstore reliable enough to replace this need either
What a boring event The best thing about this video is the new Anker accessories lol
im going from a standard iphone 11 to the 15 plus15 pro still not sure but im super exciteddd
Again Samsung has had this features years ago lol
Always few steps behind
Always waiting for Macques Brownlee
Meh I have the 14 Pro and the only feature I like on the 15 Pro is the Titanium frame Literally dont care about anything else USBC is cool I guess should have happened years ago but ok
This is why I wait multiple generations of phones to upgrade I have an iphone 12 so the upgrade will feel fairly significant to me especially since I upgraded to the USBC ipad a few months ago Having all devices charging on USBC will be pretty great and allow me to take a single cable while traveling or using carplay in my car
Apple tell me you dont know what else to dowithout telling me you have no f idea
"I like the way theyre marketing the USBC as faster data transfer and no more cable clutter Like yeah no shit Those are some of the main reasons people have been asking fit USB on the iPhone for YEARS And theyre only doing it now because of the EU law requiring USBC otherwise theyd stubbornly stick to lightning 

And its obvious why they arent offering fast charging yet They love to milk things nice and slow They arent going to give it to you now because they want to use it as a marketing point later So next year or the year after they will finally give fast charging and theyll play it up like some huge new feature and everybody will act like its revolutionary even though Samsung has been doing it forever"
Learned a hard lesson Back glass cost 600 if you dont have Apple Care And it breaks so easily  i would never not have a case 
Just beefed version of up same old thing
The iPhone pro will probably make me finally take the plunge on crossing over Waited years and just fine with budget phones But have waited for it to be worth it to my circumstances I know the next version will add blah blah but I dont need to keep updating every year it will be an advancmeement from what I have had nonetheless
"Im in camp Dont Care At All
But thanks for the video 
Always interesting to watch"
I need to watch your review but I am on the fence about switching from my Pixel 7 to 15 Pro Gonna wait for Pixel launch too
"blablablabla cut all the markting crap now i want to see a real review
if it has real titanium better cameras better battery life better screen better connectivity and i want to know if the chip is really that powerfull as apple say
so much to know"
Never fails to crack me up how apple adds features that have been around for decades and pretty it up and people just gobble it up and pay premium prices But hey its working for them USB C a customizable button 
Its useless
These feel more like S updates Ill wait till next year Seems like with apple its best to always skip a year
642 right
Fast charging is for iPhone 16 
Apple knows the people who just bought the 14 wont upgrade for ages so theyre doing minimal upgrades and saving them for later People coming from the 13 will think its a decent upgrade iPhone users arent going anywhere so theres no need to give us too much
Not worth it for everyday use its just same old phone 
Typical apple minor upgrades as usual Next year maybe well get 1 mm more closer to edgeless border lol An action button too omg so exciting lol Usbc port now so we have to now buy certified cables again I love it  See y Samsung is has so much more to offer Cant wait for Samsung s24 ultra Boring iPhone once again
So he was flying to test a carbon free iPhone Ironic
Would be great you could also do a Huawei Mate 60 impression
Im still not sure what is the major camera upgrade difference they have done for 15 pro max when compares to 14 pro max I was not able to accept that they have done any major changes on camera it looks like it But if you do one video on that I think that would be great for a clarification for many people
"Cable data transfer rate via Google or Siri

Apple lightning 480Mbps

iPhones 15 w USBCnot Pro Models 480Mbps

USBC Most Android and iPhone Pro  10Gbps  x20 faster by specs not subjective"
Important to note this is now the best mobile gaming device in the world and the first phone to support ray tracing Oh and it has the same teraflop count as an M1 chip
I cannot belive apple is still using the USB 2 standard from the year 2000 beggers believe  its so slow
I think the base 15 is a steal Especially since Im coming from a 12 pro
Your current iPhone already has a customizable button triple clicking the sleepwake button to activate the accessibility shortcut A tiny percentage of people use this so I wonder if they will use this new action button once the novelty wears off
this is actually a big deal for gaming though the future chips in all devices can literally play AAA powerhouse new console games which moving forward begs the question if developers start porting games over to apple devices why someone would need a console itself
Interested in new tech 
Aint no way I got a Samsung ad on this video 
Wow apple made it seem the entire phone was Titanium in the pro serieswhat a bummer
15 plus and 15 pro max has 200 difference for the 256 gb variant Ideally which would be suitable Considering its a 200 difference I am leaning towards pro max
They didnt switch to usbc because they wanted to they where forced into it by EU law
Still pushing my iPhone X thats almost 6 years old with a few screens replaced and a new battery I think its time Its funny that everytime a new iPhone comes out there is always features held back makin me honk I should wait another year
When i heard 128gb i was like keep that cinematic mode and pro res in ur ahole
With Apple theres always a but
Rinse and repeat Iphones are so boring 
Amazing I am  just speechless Trending and most popular phone
its a cut and paste from last year besides the type c port
I was watching the event on my 13 Pro Max which is now 2 years old and I couldnt name a single difference between the two phones that would actually make a difference to me USB C is nice but its too little to late  I still need a lightning cable for my AirPods Everything else is either a relatively small upgrade or very gimmicky and would make no real difference to me I dont like comparing phones year by year 14 PM vs 15 PM for example because very few people actually upgrade every year A lot of people do however upgrade every 2 years and Im usually one of those people But maybe the lack of phone innovation these days isnt a bad thing Itll save me money and is better for the environment if were keeping our phones for longer
They spoke  about the focal length in the keynote that its for photographers to choose between 28mm or 35mm etc
Normally an upgrade every year you but skipping this Last time I skipped a new iPhone was iPhone XS
"Only Apple can get away with their crazy approach of withholding usbC or AOD this long 
Sooo iPhone Ultra with double display will come out when people have become bored with those devices"
no infra red come on
Im sticking with my Samsung  A month later Im glad I switched to One UI Apples are pretty lean and decent designs but they dont change much every year The only thing they are doing better than Sony back in the days mini CD player etc is marketingtrends Nothing new meh For now and hopefully for more days to come Im sticking with practicality affordability improved and easier to connect to ecosystem and best tradein value within Last but not least for the money and users reviews an average person dont use all these unique features I just want my steadystablereasonable battery performance as we use this little screen more and more and just basic stuff that can be applied with advanced technique along with things mentioned here eg USB 30 For the money and anticipation Apple always have something to disappoint their loyal customers Just all business
This means by 2030 Ill be able to have an iPhone with USB type C 
"1034 default lens setting is a useful function for default image taking setting
Example antique dealer who spends all day every day collecting images of antiques"
I have iphone 14 pro max but i dont know if it worth upgrading to 15 pro max
I tend to switch every 2 years so since I have the 14 pro Max Ill wait for the 16 pro max
Just usbc
Yesterday
Congratulations  iphone 1515plus15pro15pro max
On 14 pro max and Ill be waiting until next year Not amazed by this years updates
They are slow walking features to unveil them on future models
Absolutely staying w 14 Pro Max Never been more sure D
Its funny that every add on the video is Samsungs
headphone users thwarted again
Kinda makes me wonder what the point of MagSafe is for MacBooks It kind of seems unnecessary now when literally every other device charges with usb c I know you can still charge with usb c but why dont they remove it and replace it with another usb c port
Thought you once said apple would go portless before ever implementing usbc 
Can anyone send a link to this beatiful desert wallpaper from thumbnail
usbc to lightning adapters
USB C is a huge deal for me personally because I travel quite a bit for work and having just one cable is a nice quality of life change I am still using 12 pro max because it is working fine but Will upgrade this time around
The charger not be fast charging is such a missed opportunity
Love the content MKBHD your videos inspired me to start my Tech channel Any pointers would be awesome
ohh they have fast charging but for the next year iPhone 16
I like the action button and usbc on the new pro phones  Prob would opt for the 256 pro max  But my 12 pro max isnt going anywhere anytime soon  I cant justify switching it out yet  Lol
Not gonna lie Apple flexing USB 30 in 2023 as a headline feature in a flagship phone is honestly embarrassing
I have an 11 and was ready to grab a 14 pro just for the hell of it Now Ill just wait to get the 15 pro Nothing major though just Apple doing Apple marketing
I was actually really excited to hear about the USBC coming to the iPhone As for me being just a basic phone user I do think that the 15 or 15 would be sufficient However Im also very interested Pro and promax as far as the max lineup goes I do you like the titanium body not real big on the colors kind a wish they mimic the colors but but I like the idea of having a macro camera
This industry needs some serious competition Cant just increase the numbers every year 
Idk who had it better Apple or the guy that went to China to mod his iPhone to have a usb c port I think thats what it was anyway
I gotta ask your opinion for someone who is on a budget would you say its worth spending the extra 200 for the pro phones this year
Same sad as phone 
iPhone with USBC is a dub
Staying with my 14 pro max Nothing exciting and same design from years 
Appreciate the insane quality of this video knowing you are mobile
Great video as always Here in Spain 15 Pro Max start at 1470  1577
So portait mode photos are now 48mp
I was so psyched for you when I saw you mentioned during the event 
Finnaly with   TypeC
Ive got an iPhone 12 Pro and for the last few years there simply has been no reason to upgrade This is the same I think Ill be using my 12 until the battery will give out one day
Maybe the reason people havent plugged their phone in in a long time is because the functionality is so bad
At least mention that Apple was legally forced to use USBC and they spent a lot of money to try and retain that monopoly and lost Thats not innovation and they went kicking and screaming into it
Baddest Man in Tech Congratulations
Nothing interesting about new iphones
Could the action button be customized to close all open apps  Unsure if thats something that can be specified to do vs launching an app
Where can I get the wallpaper shown in the thumbnail Great video as always
Im in camp not worth upgrading fromlast Gen
Its the same
Gone are the day when you look at the side of your phone and see the orange color and youd know that it is on silent
Hey MKBHD the focal length isnt the same as cropping afterwards It changes the look of the photo especially portraits look a lot better in certain values of focal length Cropping will never get you that result
lets admit it Iphone 15 got nothing new beside the USBC
I recently switched to a 14 Pro Max and I only kind of regret it The faster USB would be nice but for the rest I dont feel like Im missing much Maybe the action button but not much else The only thing I find weird is the new Portrait mode I cant help but feel that thats not a hardware feature worthy of mentioning It feels more like a software update which theyre artificially keeping out of the older iPhones
I loved the video all the right info on the new iPhones cant wait for the hands on review
"What a shame my favorite tech YouTubers have spent hours talking about the colours of iPhone but NOTHING about Huaweis satellites phone Mate 60 I even suspect this is part of the US ban Hey we NEED competition As some one who owns 30 iOS
 Devices and 20 Macs can I say Apple  please have a look on what Huawei has done"
Steel is a stronger metal Titanium is just less dense
So is worth the switch from Android USB C was my want for years but lack of fast charging could be deal breaker if it really takes 2 hours to full charge 
decentralization of information property ownership is the new norm
I have the 13 mini I love my mini iPhone It fits well in my pockets I enjoy my iPhone mini and I do not see the benefit after two years to upgrade my iPhone 13 mini these new iPhone 15s are underwhelming in my humble opinion
The biggest problem with the new phones is I would be willing to bet most of the new camera features could be enabled on last years Pro phones with just a software update
Bro your video quality is 8k 
Apple has never really wowd anyone recently with their innovation But today is truly rock bottom in terms of innovation for apple
Honestly Im getting annoyed with these iPhones  they all the same
welcome to type C bro
Its giving s year

Straight up MKBHD should be more negative about this phone which makes me think hes getting paid by apples not to be too negative
And we present You all new Iphone Never seen design before D
Im not in Keeping the 12 another year But Im definitely updating the iPad Pro this year  but sounds like next year is when I get it 
Freaking finally they do USBC
for me one of the biggest upgrades you glossed over a little the thinner bezels if you look at the spec its 1mm smaller H  W so 05mm smaller bezels all round which is quite alot on a slim bezel plus the smaller size and weight is a big plus although that leads me to the 13 mini thats been discontinued probably due to it stepping on the SE toes if it was cheaper than the reduced 599 price for the 61 13 i suspect this means a new SE with the design of the mini will be coming soon
"Ok besides not trusting the major charging port change on the first run 

When charging the acting button to opening a apps dose The default function of muting the phone still work too or only the programed function"
I AM REALLY SURPRISED THAT 1000S OF JOB LESS PEOPLE ARE REACHUNG TO SEE AND PROMOTE THE NEW IPHONE LAUCHING EVERYTIME APPLE IS LAUCHING THE JUST SIMPLE PHONE IN THEIR LIFE  THEY REALLY HAVE SO MUCH OF SPARE TIME TO WASTE ON I AM CONSIDERING THEM NON PAID EMPLOYEE FOR APPLE  HERE I AM TAKING MARQUE YOU OUT OF THAT NON PAID EMPLOYEE THEY ARE SO POOR 
Apple is going the BlackBerry way with the new iPhone and instead of revolutionizing they are selling stale stuff in New packing The day is not far when a worthy competitor comes and shake their foundation
I was considering waiting for the 16 but I feel my 12pro may have no trade in value by then
How about the 3D Video feature What do you think about that
Not bad enough features on the 15 pro max to justify an upgrade Apple is basically trying to match the prices of Samsungs lineup it seems 80010001200
Yay the time of the year when everyone fan boys over the same phone from last year
dont care about apple products never did never will love ur videos though glad to stay informed
Lol lmao
"Apple This is the worlds first USBC compatible phone

STANs "
"I think they will iclude lighting to usb c  Which they have to include it in the box  OR 
You have to buy light to usb c"
"usb c  wow
android users  ok"
Was looking forward to the iPhone 15 pro max But for me It just doesnt excite me to change I was hoping they would do a super zoom similar on the samsung Will skip this version and stick with my 13 pro max
For the real reason Ill be getting a new phone for a new battery
This is a great review of a meh product So typically Apple that their new phone is ridiculous Like keeping the loyal Apple fan base on a perpetual drip Samsungs Note 20 ultra released in 2020 had a 108 megapixels main camera an ultrawide one and a 5x optical zoom It was a super phone at that time I still have it Now Im on the S23 ultra and its superb 200 megapixels main camera 3x optical  10x optical zooms and ultrawide Fast speed USB C was always there Not to mention the quality of the display Really Apple makes me laugh Its fans  too
The fact that its just USB is exactly what matters iphone is now just another usbC gadget and its a good thing for everyone
Crazy so Im not upgrading then
I remember that action button on one of the old BlackBerry DTEk devices as far as I remember
Cant wait to buy this phone
Bring on the Tesla phone
The action button should be A Bixby Button
Im getting the 15 pro Need an upgrade as my 12 pro has a really bad battery
I feel like you glossed over the gaming imlications of the new chip in the 15 pro
iphone Z coming soon
Im still on the 12 pro max havent seen a big enough change to justify spending that much money on any new phone weather its iphone or android
From a 13 Pro max user it is worth the upgrade Apple is every year even better It is time for a 500mgb phone
I dont buy a new iPhone every year or so I have an 11 Pro Max Its in great shapehas always been in a case I may buy a new 15 Pro Max if it looks worth the investment
I wish iPhones had better cameras The zoom quality is so trash
"Camp dont care here

This was the new model I was looking forward to and it fell flat

Apple gets no kudos from going to USBC They didnt want to they were forced to or they had to give up sales to an entire continent  They brought NONE of the tangible benefits USBC has like faster charging faster data transfer etc  They switched begrudgingly to USBC then throttled it Apple couldve switched to USBC ages ago when it was apparent it was the dominate connector they sold us a subpar connector for generations because they owned the design and could profit on customers and an entire aftermarket that had to pay for their certification  They couldve led the charge on USBC and chose not to  

5x optical zoom is okay but I can give a damn about more digital zoom given its literally the same MP camera  Just a recipe for making a photo look worse  

Titanium Alright fair  As mentioned the steel case was plenty strong  Id personally prefer aluminum for maximum weight savings  Its still strong you just cant abuse it which realistically the steeltitanium versions still have the Achilles heel of the glass screen  

Once again boring flagship colors  Why is it I have more choice with entry level designs than I do the premium builds  How many years are we going to get a different shade of blue

Another year of a pittance incremental update  Most of those updates only useful for professional photographers and videographersthe same people that already have better equipment than iPhones Keeping one less version of cable around isnt worth the premium pricetag"
Apple Is Truely Over Rated All they do is put the same stuff in a new phone every year and add minor improvement Apple reminds me of starbucks Overpriced coffee over priced phone
s
I have been on Android since Android Donut I am switching to Apple as a result of 1 USBC 2 The new Apple Dad Safety Features Its been a good run
Disappointing they are still making a Max version that doesnt do anything besides steal features that should be on the rest of the line up Good vid Marques
That smart portrait mode has been available on galaxy phones for at least a couple of years
FINALLY Buying two cables really has been stupid
Anyone thats on the 11pro or after and thinks this 15 is innovative or edgy Cmon stay on the 11 until it dies I moved from the 11 to the 14 and prob will move from the 14 to the 24 at the rate Apple is innovating what a lack of everything lately with phone and devices in general Another meh event  The hype machine says its so amazing but dont fall for that coz thats they job to hype everything they get their hands on 
No fast charging because they have to have something new for next year
Slightest and coolest description Marques is truly a referent He even got quoted by Apple in the launching event
Ive seen your name featured during the presentation bro congratulations
"well now that my country is trying to ban my iphone 12 i guess im kinda forced to buy a 15 even though i planned to keep it for much longer

funny how they all cry about planned obsolescence even tho mine works completely yet i may have to change it because an organism just decided to"
Just compare the 14 pro and test out the new features it will tell you everything
I generally purchase the iPhone every year It has become tradition for me Last year going from the 13 Pro Max to the 14 Pro Max was a pretty big disappointment This year they changed the Apple Card and iPhone financing to only work with one of the three major carriers Im on Google Fi Maybe if the big 3 carriers could figure out how to let us swap esims to other phones without hassle Id consider them again but I dont appreciate being driven toward them by a company that should only be concerned with selling its hardware This will probably be the first year I dont buy an iPhone Pretty disappointing trend overall
For once I appreciate the little things Apple took with Iphones  USB port finally and that customizable button I can customize that button for camera shutter to make composition and framing a lot easier just like using a camera
iphone 
It is still less powerful than iPhone 16
Idk but bros camera is better than my eyesight
Nah man Im good I went from the iPhone 6s to the 13 pro max I think Ill wait until the upgrade is actually significant like it was last time for me Maybe the first foldable iPhone or something  My 2cents advice is control yourself people dont spent all your money enriching Apple Theres more to life than the latest and greatest iPhone
Its interesting that not a lot of people are talking about the spatial video feature the new cameras enable Id have thought that would be a bigger deal as it adds an entirely different value dimension to the vision pro
I have a iPhone 14 pro Im not going to upgrade this year
Im upgrading from 11 to 15 pro max sadly without lightning
"let me fix that for you huge leaps forward ray tracing in hardware in a phone is news also foreshadows the M3 series new shader architecture double down on neural engine on device processing for LLM voice rec etc capture 3D video with depth 60fps 4k able to connect external storage and directly record ProRes video to it expanded satellite services Big upgrade to UWB They also unlocked 48mpx from DNG which is a bit of segmentation BS but it is done as is the standard iPhone not being able to capture ProRES or DNG while using the SoC that was doing it last year which is full segmentation BS

I would say this is the biggest YoY update to iPhone since the 11Pro Its not amazing but they subtly have also added 3 lenses to the standard iPhone yes by cropping the 48mpx main sensor but FWIW it is now as an experience a 3 lens system

Anyway I am eagerly awaiting Waveform banter this week"
Sad to see the Pro handicapped versus the Pro Max The Pro isnt really Pro
Where to get the wallpaper in thumbnail
"Only real change is titanium body and A17 processor
Rest should have already there from the beginning"
"Hands down the most exciting feature of the 15 Pro Max is the 35mm lens 

That is basically the most used focal length of fotography and filmmaking Before you had to zoom in to get that focal length and loose resolution on the way This is damn powerful and I always wondered why it is not a default for every single phone"
W apple USB c all the way
Typical iphone users complaining how trash iphone is but still buys it anyways
Excellent presentation iPhone 15 Pro Max 1Tb is the way to go By the way I love Anker products they are the very best in the charging cables and power banks industry
First time I would ever consider moving from android to iPhone after using android my whole life just for usb C Probably wont But still
"the iphone 15 definitely feels like an upgrade from the iphone 13

the iphone 14 model updates where meh where u had to think if its gonna be worth the upgrade with little to no differences with the 13 models aside from the dynamic island"
Bixby button is that you
Hows it feel to finally get stuff that androids have had for years
Feels like they messed it up this year I thought its gonna be a periscope camera that can do 3x to 10x opticallyWhy get rid of the 3x Its great on the 14 pro 5x wont be used as much
10x optical zoom was the biggest for me who travels a lot and has to take good pics from a distance so I guess the 5x will be a good upgrade for folks preferring IOS over Android
USB is slower As a former Android user I hope Apple goes back to lightning
I was smiling so big when I saw Marques being quoted at the Apple presentation Really happy for him such a long and interesting journey What comes to the iPhone honestly a very big disappointment Even this video alone is more impressive than the new iPhone 
Same phone with little improvements 
So basically get the iphone 14promax  and if you want the so called extra perks get the 15promax lmao You get the baseline phone iphone 15 and 15 thats just the last pro max module specks with the same data transfer speed and everything then whts the point of the usbc then Pathetic
The features introduced last year are vaaaastly more impressive Dynamic island  Always on screen vs a different charging port that will have you throwing away dozens of perfectly good cables
USBc maybe because thats what people notice first when it comes to changes in design i mean peple are used to the same designe since iphone 1112 13 14 and now 15
I know you are supposed to sound thrilled about the refresh but it truly was disappointing
I was hoping the shortcut could have 2 or 3 functions Like hold for silent Click for X click double for Y
Definitely getting a new phone this round But for the first time Im seriously considering the Pro Max because I love what telephotos lenses can do But Ive never wanted to deal with the bigger size Well see
I wonder what other accessories will work Guessing the same as the iPad So things like Ethernet adapters HDMI capture dongles Keyboards
some people says that the regular iphone 15 is still at 60hz is it true 
I would assume the switch to USBC has to do with the new regulation from EU which states that all phones cameras and tablets sold in EU must be equipped with usbc charging port by the end on 2024 Its a step to reduce electronic waste
I was watching this video like 5 hrs ago then I paused it and went to sleep and now its showing 43 min ago
"seems like they finally took a step in the right direction I doubt they wouldve without being forced to but a positive change nonetheless 

I still wanna get the Asus Zenphone tho"
Is it also wireless charged as well
I know a lot od times people say oh its the same etc pretty much every year its minor upgrades since they release one every year they need to spread out the enhancements and changes so they have something every year to showcase the internals work better now USB C which is a great step but at this point the iPhone is at a plateau especially in terms of design the next wow factor for Apple will be when they decide to drop a folding iPhone i feel it might resemble the Samsung Flip rather than the Fold but anything is possible
Apple banging on about being carbon neutral whilst people fly from around the world to attend their events beautiful
You should link the wallpaper used in the thumbnail
"Your face not looking right i mean something wrong with your eyes area  
I hope nothinhg wrong with you just lightning effect  Stay blessed"
I love apple quoting you in the beginning of the keynote Well deserved 
I cant believe there are people who still buy iPhones knowing that is the same phone
"Honestly I think why they didnt give USBC 30 speeds to the base model is their target audience is for the base is for the average iPhone user  The average Joe who isnt tech saavy isnt up on the tech world doesnt care about shooting crazy photo and video  They want to take pictures of their kids birthday party soccer games and talk and text with friends maybe play a game of Wordle and do some banking  That user doesnt need to transfer heavy files  They probably have never thrown a cable in their phone for any reason for years  They charge their phone on their MagSafe charger or charging stand before bed and thats it  Putting greater transfer speeds on a phone meant for that user is just horrible overkill and a waste for them  They wouldnt use it

I do wish they had fast charging absolutely  If you get the right cable and charging setup you can get it done a little faster but it still takes a while  I know theres not much you can do differently short of making a folding iPhone which I think they are leery of that is because it can impact iPad sales  But I wish they did something well needed or just totally different  Even if it was one change  Cameras are always going to be there its always going to be rectangular there isnt much you can do about the form factor Trying to make the cameras slimmer on the back OK  But in the end the form factor there is what you can do differently at the moment I just wish they would do some thing completely different but that wouldnt be Apple they like to play it safe  Thats where I miss Steve

They need to do Apple rings like the oura ring  Or if they want to keep marketing this as a DSLR replacement for your pocket like they are trying to do create SOLID cradles like the Shiftcam that arent just plastic junk  More fun accessories would be interesting to see"
Yay Apple finally getting features Android has had for years and years
No more change days
You have failed as a smartphone company if your standard feature on a new version is usb type c
thank god for EU pushing Apple to start using the UBCC
youre getting dangerously close to the BIG corpos man not good
Is apple using recycled materials in the production of their new iphones and watches
Do you think next years iphone 16 will have the a17 pro chip or will it be a different maybe non 3nm regular a17
This video made me want to get the Fold 5 lol I waited an entire year in hopes of a visually different iPhone and it never came Maybe next yearmaybe
Im scared about the 5X I love my 3X for portraits
USB 20 on iphone 15
Definitely going to get iPhone Pro Max when possible
This event might of been the worst 
I plan on getting the 15 pro blue 256 I need a lighting phone And im hopping battery life it better
Not this year Keeping my 13 pro max until a phone is worth the money
Marq was trying his hardest to think of something good to say
I dont care at all about this new release 
The old same new iPhone is trash like always Im keeping my iPhone 13 Pro Max until they do something different
Im in camp debating on it Will see what the tradein value of my 14 pro is and decide then
Hey I have iPhone 11 and looking for upgrading my phone Not sure i should go for 15 Pro or 15 Pro Max What do you think is more worth it
Apple will go to the end of the universe just to find the easiest way possible to upgrade their design profile on the pro without actually doing anything that changes the actual profile of the phone Just another oneoff change that could go back to the old function next gen and no one would care They changed a switch to a button just wow amazing What innovation
Great review as always camp I dont care camp I hate replacing all my cables car office home kitchen all of it spend spend spend
Congrats on the event Im not interested just yet in the new phones
I upgraded Two generations in one upgrade I went from the six S to the eight and man this thing blows me away The quality scratches from whoever had it in their pocket before me amazing My car didnt cost as much as that iPhone
Seeing Assasins creed coming to pro models and all the rest of that technical masterpiece I have 11 pro working still like a new one so 
As some one with the 14pro Ill wait 2 more years before an upgrade
CtrlC CtrlV last 4 version iPhone 
SOooooooo basically its mostly a software upgrade GOT IT
Thanks Marques I think Ill just upgrade to the 15 Plus Ill probably switch to the Pro Max when the Vision Pro has evolved a little Looking forward to feeling the rounded edges as I hardly use a case anymore
Galaxy S24 coming
Never dumping my iPhone mini
"i dont know about you but i found out that switching to 2x makes photos look like they have been taken by a DSLR camera  
i guess thats why Apple gives you the ability to switch Focal length"
Keeping my iPhone XS Max Apple need to step up their game like Samsung Using 48MP while Samsung is already on 200MP is not acceptable imo Also waiting few years to upgrade your phones helps the environment and minimize slave trade and child labor for people that cares
Apple managed to implement USB C but its USB 20 USB 30 came over 15 YEARS AGO
Is there a minimal or huge difference between the 11 pro max and 15 pro phones Havent upgraded cause doing it every year is kind of dumb Just wondering if the difference is significant now to do it If no Ill just keep my phone still
Make a video if its worth it or not I am not really excited to switch my iPhone 14 pro max
Great Phones Great video butthat RED camera needs stabilizationaha
Marquez are you going for the pro max this time 
I kinda like the lighting port a little better
Lol I felt the broken glass hahah I somehow missed a section of my screen when I placed the tempered glass so here first time I broke a screen on pro max that I paid 1299usd I think amp lol Im super clumsy and super sucks it happened on the most expensive phone that I paid for but hey its still working at 3 yrs old lol I just hope they can fix the glass I dont have any plans of upgrading yet but if they will include our country on the emergency satellite calls will consider getting one cuz thats legit really helpful Hope they can update that soon cuz having a satellite phone is really essential
"Basically the same iPhone as last year but with a new high price 
Nice "
I like the pros but Im gonna wait one more year and get a 16 pro max and Apple Watch X at the same time
Hes so handsome
Ill just wait half a decade so i csn actually afford this 
I have an 11 Pro Max And have been waiting for usbc to upgrade Will be getting there 12 Pro Max
My man got shout out from Apple at the event Achievement unlocked Now youre officially the tech GOAT  So proud of you to see you grow this big as Im a subscriber since 2008 Love from Bangladesh 
Pretty sad when the big new feature is adoption of USBC standard
Glad you mentioned the usb32 Shine the light on how  apple continues to rip there customers off
Its a lot of money 
Yep just keep upgrading and upgrading then complain about climate change and other bs narratives The days of buying or replacing of broken goods is gone to these useless eaters just consuming every year just keep buying and consuming Lets try an old trend keep what works and buy when it cant be fix
 Hello
Thank god theyve finally put usb on their bloody phones The headaches Ive had with people who happen to be the odd one out with an iPhone and cant charge it using any cables that any other person in the world has ready to hand My partner has iPhone now I can stop buying her overpriced cables that she loses all the time One less headache for me and Im not even an iPhone user
Apple losing Steve Jobbs was like the world losing Albert Einstein They no longer have any innovation at the company Sad to see
I love your work Marques
LONG TIME AGO PEOPLE WOULD USE THEIR PHONES TO SHOW OFF  PEOPLE WERE IMPRESSED  Today no one cares what phone you have and it impresses no one  even poor people have the latest iPhones 
So mr iphone lover u didnt mention iphone settled as u mentioned in fold 5
Going from the XS plus to the Max 
They should just go back to a plastic back The glass just makes the phone more fragile Theres all sorts of ways you can make plastic feel as premium as glass including ceramic coatings Apple could use polycarbonate and then advertise Made from ballistic grade plastic or something
"Title Not just USBC 

Proceeds to explain the whole vid about how they are the same phones with just usdc"
Ive been using an iPhone XR since 2019 I only want an iPhone 15 is for the USB C I want to simply my cable life
As someone with an XR thats one its last legs Ill definitely be upgrading to the 15 Cant wait to get that sweet sweet pink
i will just stick with my 13
Congratulations to Apple for joining the 21st century
"That dynamic portrait photo is honestly great I really couldve used that feature a few times on my 14 Pro Max

Also was that game demo AssassinsC Creed Mirage Thats a brand new AAA game Thats pretty wild that it can run that

The Ti rails is nice too I always hated the stainless steel fingerprint rails"
Im in the Gonna stay with my iPhone 12 for another couple of years camp
they need to switch everything over to usb c by january the law mentions all devices sold not just new devices
Im in the wait and see camp I have a 14 Pro Max 1TB The USBC is the main feature I wanted but there would have had to have been a lot of new features I was considering stepping down to the Pro for its smaller size but without the camera optical zoom I would have to go back to the Max So Im not sure there is enough of a change to make it worth going to the new phone
I will still be upgrading from my 13 pro max but I am a bit disappointed in the 15 pro max I use my phone so much for work that its starting to show the battery has suddenly taken a hit over the last couple of months and Ive had to charge it a few times while I still needed it and the performance is seemingly suffering a bit too I dont like the removal of the mute button I dont like that we get the same charging speeds and Im not a fan of the color choices However I am looking forward to the improved zoom camera the potential efficiency improvement of the new chip and the brighter screen and thinner bezels will be nice I wouldnt justify those improvements with an upgrade but my hand is kind of being forced to do something and I dont believe a battery swap in my 13 pm would be worth it If anyone is wondering my better health is only at 87 but feels lower and my average screen on time over the last ten days is just under 12 hours per day but that includes 1 or 2 days off of work My battery did use to get me through a long 1214 hour work day no problem with plenty to spare now I need to charge up or else the battery can drop down to 20 or less
"I wish they had white the pink is really cute though 
I need waterproof AirPods to be a thing "
ngl the 5x camera got me interested but ill need to see the reviews first
Is there a way to automatically add a time stamp to iOS photos without having to download an app
Iphone 20 will be 0005 nanometer chip Wait Wait A nonanometer chip 
Android owns Apple periodt
Strong Apple User here within the whole ecosystem Glad I switched to the Fold 5 for the first time from the 14 PRO MAX  Will go back to Apple for the  iPhone 17 when the Dynamic Island is embedded in
Mate60 Pro  Come on MKBHD we know you are unbias
When did phones become so samey and boring
Watching this on my wrecked and rooted 8 Plus
I hoped there would be more but Im upgrading from an 11 so is a big jump either way
Only apple can use iPhone colors as a new feature
Meh Im satisfied with the 14 ProMax
A lot of people forget that lightning was a great connector back when it came out  It took androids years to switch away from micro usb
Once that pro motion and OLED screens come to base iPhones pro models wont be worth buying
" Wow raytracing hardware on a smartphone otherwise it has existed on smartphones for at least 2 years 

An action button  isnt that the Bixby button 

Av1 decoding and Log it already exists on other smartphones for at least 2 years 

Seriously maybe its because Im not part of the  cult that I cant understand the wow effect caused by the iPhones 15  15 Pro 

On the other hand I would sincerely like to know why and how the iPhones 14 Pro can not and will not benefit from the new software features present on the standard iPhones 15 



Ps On the bright side as always since Apple has now adopted these technologies developers will use them and integrate them into their applications and this can only be beneficial for the smartphone world "
I know you have almost 20 million followers which is just insane and well warranted but I was still stoked for you to have an actual shoutout on the Apple announcement
I would really love to see a smaller camera bump vs better cameras
I honestly see nothing different but wow congrats to usb c after 11 years we literally been asking for it since 1112 years ago Samsung been having usb c since 2016
Hi   bro
thanks to EU for the usb type c connector in the 15 series  Im sure there is a difference bewteen EU models and other regions iphones
Gotta say Im an iPhone user and while I do occasionally wish they would increase charging speed I never find myself in a situation where the standard fast charging isnt enough And dont want degraded battery life for the faster charging
Shouldve been an S phone
not just usbcwith even higher price  
This was just  Meh It feels like They settled  but hey  Maybe next year
It looks the exact same shit from its predecessor lol
Apple is being petty and bitter with the change to USBc Because its not that they wanted to do it but they were forced
That nextgeneration portrait thing seems a lot but more modern I am sure like something that existed on the Lumia phones a long time ago where you could take a photo and set the focus later I never understood why even today there is no phone still that equals the Lumia featurewise regarding photos
Im planning on getting the 15 pro refurbished from Apple in 2024 my XR is starting to feel slow in some cases I started saving last year lol
Why there is no Iphone 14 Mini yet Will there be a 15 Mini
Im trying to think of a reason to trade in my iPhone XS Max and I cant think of any Im gonna spend 1000 to watch YouTube videos and use text Nah Im gonna ride this baby until it dies 5 years so far so good
What caught my attention is direct storage when tethered directly to a external storage device Looking forward to see how creators make use of that function
can we expect a wired typec earphones from apple 
Where the Next level of Innovation very stagnated Design Titanium is nothing ground breaking Apple could have created something exciting to justify the cost increase Seems like same phone more money and people will buy itJust because
GREAT iPhone adding something to their phones that has been in the market place for over decade and acting like its new Android til I diiiiiie iPhone users are suckers
"The action button is a cool idea but I kinda wish there was multiple functions at a time like lets say that it was press and hold to switch between mute and unmute but I could map a double press for the flashlight or something else Kinda like how pressing and holding the power button activates Siri but a double tap opens Apple Wallet I feel like that was a missed opportunity I love the mute switch but I also use the flashlight a lot and would love a hands free way to turn it on 

It would also be nice to map it as a playpause button for musicmedia so you can pause it in a pocket The action button could be mapped to use single clicks double clicks and long press clicks for multiple different functions Single clicks to playpause long presses to muteunmute and double taps to turn on the flashlight or open an app

But that could be future potential or maybe something that can be added using software But I think it has a lot of potential to become an amazing accessibility feature"
Im in camp I dont give a blunt nickel What camp are you in
They wont add fast charging this year so they have something to sell  to you next year
No design at all they should just have taken a Sony  Xperia pro one and gave it iOS it would have been a game changer Apple is now tailing in innovation with cosmetic changes being done and calling it a a new iphone This is just a 2023 iphone 14
Question is it possible to connect the iPhone to a monitortelevision using the usbc port
David is so cute in that camera roll 
1111 is that a Fuji GFX100 II 
The phone looks the same as the previous years For the people who always wanted the latest phone will they even bother since they all look the same and the average person cant tell the difference
Ill hold onto my 14 pro for at least 3 more generations not worth the upgrade
"Apple We are unveiling USBC and get this a button you can program to do things

Android Uh ok welcome to 2017 I guess

Such innovation much wow"
The last iPhone I used was 6s Since then I havent been much interested Now that they finally added USBC and Pro phones camera bumped to 48MP I will think of switching to iPhone next year when they may bump the camera of base models to 48MP
new iphones dont feel new anymore Its just a little improvement in screen processor and camera Now the type c seems like the biggest upgrade lol
Ive watched 3 tech reviewers explain the iPhone updates but Marques explains them best 
I hope they failed to appease Marques with their mention of him at the event to make him more generous with his comments about this iPhone and this companys greddy practices
The point and shoot camera is dead Even for photography enthusiasts the only upgrade after an iPhone would have to be a full frame camera
That isnt a camera Island Its the freakin camera HIGHLAND
imagine getting impress by a tech from 2014 lol
As a 13 pro max owner and a first gen AirPods Pro owner who will NOT be buying new AirPods anytime soon and  therefore will still need a lightning cable around regardless I just dont care about the 14soh sorry 15
Samsung is such a troll for paying youtube to show ads on this video
As a decade long android user who also uses macbooks and ipads just having a USBC makes me considering to switch a lot more than any previous iPhones
They are just copying android at this point 
032
a switch that is pressable would have been better
I need a 48 mega pixel front camera please apple most people use the front camera for content creation
Maybe one day Anker will actually apologize for the eufy security cameras 
1199 256 gb starting price is them just prepping you to naturally increase the price according to my inflation senses theyre probably gonna justify all the phones being 100 more expensive but starting at 256 gb since storage being 100400 increases in price is virtually unjustifiable within 13 years
Barely changing anything in these new phones
Can we get your wallpaper
Im in no rush my gf has a newer iPhone than me and if I was going to get the new one Id prefer we both got new ones so we can bin all of the lightning connectors Also my AirPods are only a year too so Id have to keep my lightning for them too Ill wait
ive been with android for the entire time ive had a phone and have been wanting to switch to iphone for a while now and i think this is finally the time to switch for me haha
anyone feeling deja vu
im surprise that marques was surprised with apple decision ofc they will always make a 5050 situation where people can get an upgrade but also force to have a reason to wait for the next one
i can live without fast charging for a bit longer though it is still a bummer but i am pretty let down they didnt put thunderbolt on the pros it seemed so likely im almost wondering if i should skip this gen and see if it comes next year
Why they had to kill mute switch
Its not bleeding edge stuff that we have never seen before WRONG That statement is not true The 15 Pros are the first cell phone EVER to have Thread connectivity which is great for the home automation community
Haha of course is not the space for the lens is the USP otherwise why buying a pro
They should update the iPhone front camera so many ppl use for selfies
As long as Apple continues to blow out photos with overly aggressive nondisableable HDR Im not coming back from Sony
Ill get it because I upgrade every other year Bummer the better camera isnt on the regular Pro
So basically not worth the upgrade Not even from a 13 pro max to the 15 pro max
Same shit Ill stay with my iPhone 13 Pro Max Battery is still great
Did you just say 15 plus 
You didnt mention VR video 
Im one of those people who default to 12X on the camera
finally i can shoot two birds with one stone
I am planning to buy an iPhone 15 pro However I am confused between black and blue color As they both seem soo cool Does anyone have any suggestions on which color shall I buy as for now I can not decide 
Someone has aapl stock lol
You know why they went to type c
I wished the added double tap and hold and triple tap for the action button
This year is underwhelming
"I typically upgrade on whatever programspromotions are around each year  Ive found myself bouncing back and forth between my iPhone 14 Pro fantastic device very heavy to my iPhone 13 Mini lightweight and small powerhouse short battery life often  
While theres not a lot of great upgrades this year its the lighter weight and more comfortable to hold new Pros that are winning me over the more I think about it  My partners getting one immediately to replace her 13 Pro so Ill get to see if its something I absolutely have to have"
No 120Hz on the iPhone 15 is a deal breaker I recommend not getting the normal 15 and get the Pro or wait for the iPhone 16
607 Theyll do it next year Good things come to those who wait
Very underwhelming release from apple this year
Sitting here with an iPhone XR working just fine its hard to justify an upgrade the past 5 years
the new
Im going to android  same phone lol
Guys if you want to charge your phone faster use a larger watt size wall plug eg ipad or MacBook charger  its that simple But be warned that your battery life will reduce faster Fast charging is the worst thing you can do to your phone if youre not a YouTuber
Same boring phone
So the new iPhone is an old Android with a better camera
Long live the European Union for having Apples nuts in a vice
This was the generation I was waiting for to upgrade from my broken XS The USB was the main reason for the wait but the soft touch back is going to be so nice as well
Apple does nothing for me because they do nothing to compete with Samsungs Fold phones I just got the Galaxy Fold 5 and to look at this new apple phone its just unimpressive
Ive been wanting to turn onoff location without having to go to setting privacy  security location services 
New design  That is nuts
what about the battery life did they increase the battery performance or just put the 14pro battery in the 15pro S
iPhone 15 with usbc hell nah
Stable Boring No surprises USBC
Ive had an iPhone SE for years wanna know if nows the time to drop a grand on a new phone or not
Highly tempted to upgrade still rocking my 13 Pro and really only need a battery replacement since Ive had no other issues with the phone I still have my other Apple accessories that keep me tied to using lightning though
Wow a new charging port without an ability to charge faster Apple innovation is dead running out of ideas
waiting for another mini here 
337 the new portrait mode feature on this new  iphone has been on samsung note and s phones for years now 
At this point Apple is just boring AF But that button is probably one of the best improvements in a long time as a Oneplus user the iphoners will definitely love it Still the hold to use it is stupid should add double tap or whatever It is what it is Im getting a Nothing phone 2 soon so what am I saying here 
congrats on being mentioned in the wonderlust event
"Tech will be crazy in 25yrs from now
But yoooh dude mkbd just pulled 22m views in just 6hrs Show me your ways master"
"Im definitely getting this phone Not because its a huge leap in tech industry but because I have a rusty iPhone XR that needs to be changed Oh plus the USBC is finally here so that means that I can charge my phone AND my flashlight with the same cable 
Nice"
The base iphone 15 looks so cheap bc of the cameras and the fact that it STILL has only 60 hz refresh rate is just crazy 
Ill pass on this one and probably the next
Thank you for the brief overview of the IPhone 15 Pro I was strongly considering purchasing the new phone but it doesnt appear to be anything interesting about the phone other than USB C I am going to pass on this one
I cant believe Marques didnt mention his quote at the Apple Event  Congrats Daddy Marques 
smhiphone users Welcome to USBC as your newest significant update lol
Having one charger to charge my phone and laptop is important to me I cant tell you how many times I forget my lightning cable or need to unplug my normal usb c cable to plug in my lightning cable   Also now many hardware developers can have one device for Android and iPhone and wont need to make a USB C model and a lightning model
Definitely upgrading my IPhone 12 Pro Max Its time 
selling my Apple stocks Apple is dead to me Year after year they cant innovate every year i am disappointed to be honest my money is better elsewhere this is just ridiculous All this woke shit and environment garbage I dont care I want my money to go up screw Woke Tim cook
They have better margins on the pro max using the 256gb NAND as I believe 256gb is actually cheaper than 128gb and them selling it for more improves the margins
I really liked the pillow and ribbon shades
Will the airpods max release with usbc soon
So is it just me or is the 15 the sweet spot of this lineup
So basically the iphone 15 on 2023 is getting features that been on every Android phone since like 2020
Apple still staying true to the 2 year upgrades Odd numbered Iphones dont get reeeeally upgraded I recommend waiting for next years ones
"610 they will probably be adding 40gbps thundbolt c port in iPhone 17 
Always late entry as always"
Im in camp I use the Apple Card so much that switching back to Android is not an option so Ill upgrade the 13 pro max sell it on back market to fund the 15 pro max
Ok got it waiting iphone 16
I see no actual upgrades that causes me to jump from 14PM to 15
Not worth the upgrade imo Ill stick with my 13 pro max for now
So here is lens Procedes to show a lens
"Bro no fast charging with USBC in 2023
This company is not real"
Thunderbolt speeds is for the 17 or 18 It will be innovativing and new
This is garbage by Apple  nothing innovative from Apple apart from usb c  What a waste
I dont think it was apples decision Probably some regulations to reduce plasitc waste
I would advice everyone not to use other USB c charger for the new iphone other than apple one There is way too many cases of ipad with USB c port and charging chip dying due to other chargers
"Apple has stopped innovatingthey are still trying to prove that Face ID is actually better than the Fingerprint sensor but NO theyre actually making the iPhone ugly every time firstly with the  Notch then the Dynamic island
Apple iPhone without any type of NotchDynamic island which supports 45W fast charging and has a side mountedunder display fingerprint sensor would be a game changer"
tungsten is the strongest of any natural metal 142000 psi But in terms of impact strength tungsten is weak  its a brittle metal known to shatter on impact
Ummmmm battery life Any changes there
By far the best thing about the iPhone 15 Pro is that we finally get some real games like Resident Evil and Death Stranding Very impressive to see those on a phone Also having Raytracing is pretty cool But yeah aside from that not much has changed as every year With the processing power of the A17 Pro they could make a dock and let run full desktop programs like Final Cut Pro X Now that would be innovation yes im aware DeX exists but theres not many desktop like applications for it
Dude they were forced to use USBC by the EU why are you not mentioning it The EU is going to make manufacturers bring back easily replaceable batterieswhich is great by 2027 most people will keep their phone for multiple years as phones and phone cameras are more than good enough now for 99 of people Dont worry about  dust and water  my Samsung S5 was dust proof and was waterproof for 30 minutes submerged back in 2014 and you could replace the battery in about 10 seconds
Hello pps please dont buy it cuz in simple terms nothing has changed significantly so we are waiting for the next model with the hope of innovation
im considering jumping from the 12 but not completely convinced
9999 of viewers by now would be able to PREDICT with 9999 accuracy how the Next 2 Gens of iPhone looks like or maybe next 10 Gens
The fact that a 900 phone has the same USBC as the budget Android phones from 2018 is mind blowing
Are you serious supporting this scam Come on man
At this point Apple has just given up on even trying to keep up with the competition They know no matter what they make Apple fan boys will keep on buying their products and praise them  Tim Cook is just scamming them and the fan boys will continue to blindly praise Apple
Basically the same iPhone with a USBC
its a camera that makes phone calls Like all this technology knowledge freedom advancements the essence of a phone being a daily carrier Apple decided to do more upgrades in Camera Gaming and USBC This is so sad and outrageous that their minds were limited to these factors instead of thinking more and further about adding value in daily lives of humans maybe a pulse sensor to measure blood pressure or something else But THIS reveal is just sad
same thing different day borring apple
Thanks to Europe for the usb C  If wasnt for Europe apple didnt care about usb c
im happy i didnt stay up for the event  its like the event provide the confirmation of your disappointment
Come on Apple fanboys you have USBC now You have to celebrate Oh and you can charge your Airpods pro with your iPhone just dont forget to bring your cable with you all the time  Pathetic laughable
I have an 11 pro probably waiting another couple years
2 million views in 6hrs
Same thing again and again please think before you waste your money
Am I really the only one who finds the dynamic island quite annoying It just takes up xxx of your screen and looks really ugly when youre gaming or watching a movie on your phone It just gets in the way Look at 0458 how ugly it is and how much space it takes up
I would like to know if this phone is going to scratch like the jet black iPhone or peel like the iPhone X black did
I will stay with my Huawei nova 10 Pro
Never thought I would see the day when apple when put USBC on a iPhone
Hi good morning Marcus I am waiting for your HandsOn reviews to make my decision if Im going to buy one or not looking forward to hear your take on it
it was the most boring apple morning ever it changed colors a port a button namesprices and thats it and i guess they are not serious about selling them because colors are kind of neglected how come not include white color do i have to wait one more year for better color options by the way i was more impressed by reduction of carbon footprint that was good
So we get usb iPhones with software gimmicks and texture on the back to feel before I put my case on Yay so excited I was getting tired of my old last gen iPhone looks and boring operation wait those things are the same 
Apple  Its a redesign of the current design
even less excitement than last year maybe iPhone 16 will have more new features
yeah a non event why even have it lol should have just refreshed the page
Its funny when iphone brings something new to their as if its an innovative featurelike for example the potrait blur effect has been there on android phones for a long time now
Not chasing fast charging times is good i think if you give people a fast charger they will use it and result in more battery fatigue id rather be stuck at slower speeds quick 50 top up can still be done in under half an hour which is plenty for me how much mid day charging do people need but know my battery will still be good 3 4 or more years down the line if not maybe limit speed via software most of the time but give people a quick override for a speedy mid day top up
Still they dont have close all button under the recent apps menu
Cant wait for the full review
I think they should release every 2 years and take more time to put in more work not just some small upgrades for the most part
"Apple is literally telling everyone not to upgrade iPhones every year or every 2 years Still everyone in the internet is comparing new iPhones to previous year models

Anyone who upgrades their phones every year will definitely not wait to watch youtube videos to make up their mind

Still all youtubers are making these nonsense videos for high number of views unfortunately

I wish if theres one youtuber who do a detailed comparison between iphone 15 and iphone 1211 since most people who will upgrade are actually using these devices"
"Same ole same ole
Not buying this new recycled phone bcz of usb c charging"
No one thinks its a bit sad that basically the highlight of Apples phone is a USB standard released almost 10 years ago
Laughable  we all know its very small upgrades but man they need to stop with the BS My girl already talking about upgrading and we just got 14 Pros 
looking forward to see how much they improved  on the battery with the iPhone 15ppm but Im defiantly getting one just dont now what color yet   
So basically we have to thank the EU for both USB C and easier replacement options in the iPhone 15
Thid dude is a paid propagandist for Apple no two ways about that 
WOW another great updated iPhone 
Is the 15 pro max better or worth buying vs the 14 pro max  P
Apple still things the world is filled with dumdums Wait it is
Thank god they didnt add any feature that I would really want I guess Ill continue with my iPhone 12 Max until Apple burns it up like they did with my iPhone 7
No mention of the Notch being the same size as last year They didnt even try anything there Fully embracing a black whole way bigger than other 1000 phones in your screen while watching series scrolling or playing video games
My previous phone was a Motorola with USBC charging port  I didnt switch to an iPhone because of that port I did it for a better phone  The European decision to make all phones use USBC is not a reason for me to upgrade my iPhone
Im getting one My 13 Pro Max has been acting weird lately so I think its time
Im shocked that npcs are still aweing over smoke  
No finger print unlock
Woooow usbc   apple users being brainwashed again
Thank you  great info 
Just The Same 
best YouTuber
"I only upgrade every 5 years Iterations dont excite me but when something new comes out it is almost worth waiting a year for developers and accessory manufacturers to properly sync with what the new tech can doneeds then when the next minor iteration comes out thats the one I would go fortypically this is every 5 years 

But USB C thoughchefs kiss"
I literally have no idea why people like these phones Its the same thing as 5 iphones ago but have USB c which literally every phone besides Apple has had for YEARS
At this point iPhone should be just dropping a phone every two years   Cause  nothing innovative  happening
now we can confirm that the next iphone base will have usb 30 and the pro will get thunder bolt  as they wil have the a17 and the pro will get A18
Kinda sucks the Pro doesnt have the new zoom  Tired of lugging around giant phones
To me this new phone feels sorta like the 13 Pro Max Just some seemingly basic upgrades that actually make a surprisingly big difference Cant wait to get my hands on one to see
This is the first time in a while Im keeping my old phone idk If like the iPhone 15 I feel that it down graded
Another year same iPhone Pass
The biggest news was the not announcement of a new mini model RIP
iPhones have looked so similar for the last few generations that I genuinely cant tell the difference between the iPhone 12 13 14 and now 15 from the outside anyway To be fair Samsungs s22s23 lines look very similar but before that there was some difference I could use to differentiate
I will just weight when Apple launches iPhone with user removable battery
iPhone  got so disappointed   I remember  having a iPhone charger  that only charged iPhone was suck a flexx  not its just a regular charger  that charged  everything 
Really want that natural titanium 15 Pro
"Theres a new customizable button on the side of the new iPhone
Sweat  Thats awesome

It replaces the mute switch
Oh  Silly me for thinking theyd add a cool feature without screwing something else up"
Its the same iPhone as last year please save your 1800 for a iPhone and watch
Why dont apple just upgrade the previous phone instead of making a whole phone with the same design just with little differences
Whats the point changing the charging port if charging speed will not make any difference plus not fast charging we talking about 
Next step is to finally get Android in the iPhone We getting there
Its EU regulations
Does the stupid action button have multiple actions available at once with different actuation patterns or something Double press for camera and still single press for mute
Its literally the same phone No reason for 14 pro max people to upgrade Also last year there wasnt a reason to upgrade from 13 to 14 This is coming from an apple fan
pixel 7 pro has customizable button on power button
Anything about the base iPhone 15 refresh rate
Lol the action button is the big new feature I have had that on Samsung for a long time
 So I guess Ill keep my Pixel 
Still rocking the iPhone Xreally want an integrated stylus and dont see apple adding one anytime soon
"Dont ya think the iPad 10th gen base model has typeC
Mistake at 1 50
Just trying to help No offenc
"
"Glad I have a lot of other things old Android and stuff with USB C cords I wont need to be getting anything new

Gotta say Im gonna miss the switch It was a fidget spinner at times Its a small thing but it was very satisfying"
Titanium isnt even stronger than stainless Its about the same or a little weaker just at half the weight
Waiting on your full review but with a 12 Pro Max I think Im due for an upgrade to the 15 Pro Max I was hesitant last year because  I knew USBC was coming but Im pretty disappointed theres still no fast charging Not sure what the hold up is as Samsung has nearly perfected it
I have the 12 pro max so Im preordering my 15 pro max Friday Thanks for all the great info
I typically stay 2 generations behind when it comes to my iPhone but I am seriously considering upgrading to the 15 just so that I can phase out my lightning cables
I need a new phone bc mine is getting rly old so Ill probably have to get it but I was hoping for a much more innovative upgrade So underwhelming a 3nm chip is pretty cool and so is the camera but thats about it as always Considering they have been doing usbc in the macs for so long thats nothing new or exciting to me
lol looks the same
Fair take again especially with Apple trying to get favoritism maybe by including mkhb in the keynote PowerPoint
End of 2023 and still no 120 hz display and always on display in 15 and 15 plus Very disappointing 
"So Ive got an iPhone 12pro and Ive been thinking about getting a new phone I was excited for USB C being brought to iPhone even though Im not a huge fan of the connector design USB C puts the delicate pins on your expensive device meaning that should the pins get damaged youd have to repair the device rather then just getting a new cable that was the best part of the lightning cable in my opinion I do think an industry standard for charging across devices is a great thing so if USB C is that standard then so be it

Anyway Ive been wanting a larger camera sensor and better zoom for a while I also wanted to get better battery life Ive always been reluctant to get the plusmax versions of the iPhone because I worried it was too unwieldy but the iPhone 15 Pro Max seems to check all the boxes for me

Ultimately Im going to wait until theres some reviews and until I can actually try and use one in person to see how unwieldy it actually is I may hold out until the 16 but if the reviews are good and it feels good to use I may bite the bullet Cant wait for a full review"
I think Apple really missed the boat on this one All my devices are already utilizes USBC so the announcement for it on IPhones felt less like hype and more like them catching up to every other tech device out there Which is unfortunate Dynamic Island looks to be standard now and the action button is a really cool feature I can see being a tool people easily will depend on But I dont think its enough to get me to need to get it this year Times are tough maybe skipping this year will be more beneficial in the long run
Until they put a screen on the back and get rid of front facing camera and dynamic island Im out
im dont really care about the Pro line up other than it tells us whats coming for the new base line up next year I do really like the new colours for the base line up of iPhone 15plus especially the pink one Im probably gonna get that one it looks like a good upgrade from a iPhone XS Max which im currently still using Although i must say my phone still works pretty damn well so even though ive been using it for four years so really depends on the deals phone companies will be offering
Were definitely at the point now where it stops making sense to release a new phone every year The last 3 iphones have been functionally identical and I bet they could build a lot more anticipation for a new phone every two years as it may actually change somewhat
I wish they would make the camera bump less ugly
One thing that Im 100 on that I will not be camping outside or lining up for any iPhone ever
Getting One Marques your always on point
After enjoying the absolutely glacial USBc data transfer speeds on the m series iPad Pro recently is the a17s usb3 chip even going to get you anywhere near advertised speed File system doesnt seem up for it
I love my iPhone 14 plus it does everything and more
They did mention faster charging in their usb c presentation so Marques are you sure that its the same charging speed as before
I was really looking forward to more this year but I am pretty disappointed  USB2 on the base iPhone 15 is criminal too 20 year old technology
NO Fast Charging HUGE fail What were they thinking
15 plus is not a thing its just pro
I am sticking to my iPhone 13 
welcome to the future 5 years ago 
This year other companies release amazing phone from Huawei Motorolla Samsung and others On the other side Apple launch a new phone with a button change I think they will lose revenue and profits this year and next year because China ban the Apple in government and business settings The value of money matters and I think people who have iPhone 13 or 14 will not like to upgrade to 15 it wont be worthwhile Only apple fans will spend on the phone like a sheep I think apple watches are getting really better and better but waiting for 10th version would be special so I would wait for next year iPhone need to bring foldable technology or something big because I think now onwards I project iPhone revenue declining and that will have a domino effect by downfall stock market price and profits falling drastically unless Blackrock keep investing to keep Apple trillion dollar company
Apples innovation died with Steve Jobs
Definitely feels like an S year
Ive seen so much hate for the new iPhone 15 series online and I honestly dont know why Looks like a solid phone Cant wait to upgrade
Who came from that tiktok video with MKBHDs camera
Yeah sure still 60hz on iphone 15 completely garbage  still 6 giga ram 5X zoom
You said slider wont go in 5 years  Its a Boo bro
Bring back the iPhone Mini
Not in the market and Ive never had an iPhone but it looks pretty solid Super Apple move to put super old USB in a brand new phone
is it just me or did iphones evolved faster back in the days
"Steel is strongertitanium is stronger per kg
Better strenght to weight ratio but far far weaker"
To put the USB 2 thing into perspective its a 23year old specification Twenty three
Not too excited about the new iPhone but Im on a 12 Pro and think its time to upgrade
Guys is it normal to get electric shock or tingling while charging the iPhone I have 13 and I noticed that while charging if I touch the corners of side panels I am getting that tingling So is it normal or what
Camp  not upgrading this year the 13 pro max is still way good enough Well see what the 16 brings up could probably wait to the 17 version if the 16 isnt that much of an upgrade
Your not borrowing my usb cable now ya kunts 
You can record directly to a hard drive so who cares about xfer speeds
Not running out to get it but I will say the natural Ti colorway is calling my name
Im in camp too broke to afford it even if I wanted it
Wow Apple gets USB C   Wanderyawn
Im just not convinced on upgrading from my iPhone 13 Pro Max I lowkey want to go back to android cause the foldables are exciting but just so damn expensive  I also dont know how it would be to use a foldable phone for 2 or more years My backbone controller is holding me back from taking the leap to a foldable phone too like are they compatible with folding phones
I wish they had Lightning female to typeC male converter What do I do with my existing Lightning cable now
Lamest conference so far Cant wait for the Pixel to kill the iPhone
I watched like 10 Apple release videosyour video was the best by far
Apple being forced to switch to usbc and now marketing as if its some big thing they are doing
And now you can make 36 monthly payments on the same exact phone for the next 10 years Congrats apple users
I just switched to the 14 pro from the SE 2 months ago should Ive waited for the 15 pro
Yea thats a no for me dog 
Capturing in spatial is probably the most important feature knowing apple the Vision pro will be prevalent in the future This phone draws the line in the sand for memories you can capture in this format and hang on to at a closer more realistic way
New Iphonesame same but different
Just me or you sound weird 
I have yet to hear any compelling reason to upgrade from my 12 Pro Max maybe next year 
How is the usb c gonna work with car play 
I always prefer the pro size over the max but I know  would love that 5x zoom It would be very useful to me so the debate begins do I finally get the big bad boy or will I regret the gargantuan size
Same thing all over and expected these suck up YouTubers getting sponsored by Apple to say all the good things In reality its overpriced but same as iPhone 11
The iPhone 14pro is the first iPhone ive been absolutely happy with and I dont know if this new iPhone is something I would switch too just yet Going to wait a bit for more reviews
A more repairable iPhone and USBC feature are forced features thanks to Europe
I feel like you left out that one important detail about USBC Apple was forced to change by the UK over because of anticonsumer tactics Its not some kind of upgrade they cared to make
That backglass repairability started with the 14 lineup  They just only talked about it now
Overall it was such a disappointing event As a current iPhone 14 Pro Max there is no major update between 15 Pro Max and even though I was not expecting to upgrade this year it would have been nice to see some innovation And dont let me start with Apple Watch No improvement regarding Battery life for Ultra 2 really Apple
Apple is keeping their new fast charging for their next release They want something to be praised for every release
My Motorola has usb32 and 68 W charging not to mention 512gb Storage as the base storage option and 8gb of ram for 699 already on sale
Same phone again Great
Im still using an iPhone 11 in the past 3 years not that much has changed 
"How are people not bored of the iPhone by now USB C being the big head line feature Lol Bore fest Hopefully sales with start to slide the more they just sell you the same phone year on year forcing them to innovate again 
Apple without a pioneer such as Steve Jobs is just mere"
Im a huge apple fanatic and I was greatly disappointed by the announcement of the iPhone 15 Pro yesterday The only thing that really caught my eye about the whole keynote was the fact that the iPhone will be more capable of gaming than before otherwise the phone is basically the same as the 14 Pro Max I was really hoping to see something completely different but as per usual its only incremental changes
Never heard anyone be so surprised at a USB C port so much they keep saying USB C 
still using my iphone 7 plus havnt been impressed since
104 ITSSS REAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL
You should do a video on Fairphone 5
Def getting one because my iPhone 13 have that black circle at the bottom left you always get eventually on those screens Im getting a Pro Max this time because before the iPhone 13 I was with a Galaxy for 10 years and I miss a LOT the big screen for productivity I work in cybersecurity very heavy phone usage all day long I wished the new iPhone was a bit lighter not gonna lie I find them much much heavier than Samsung but its not a deal breaker
957 google assistant button
Im still on iPhone 12 I fell behind on the times 
still using my 6s my wifes 6s been replaced with an SE  Most regular iphones have been two expensive ever since the X model Just isnt worth spending that much if i could spend the same amount getting a macbook Ive been concerned with the direction Apple is taking Used to be that the ipad mini was the cheaper option because of its small size But the current mini is the same price as the base ipad gen 10
Ill be keeping my 14 Pro not worth the upgrade yet for me
"I am currently using iPhone 11 and planning to switch to either 15 pro or pro max
Really confused if the bigger storage and the 5x zoom will be worth paying extra from the 15 pro or not"
Kinda bummed you didnt mention the new assassins creed game is coming to the iPhone pro due to the A17 Pro Thats the easiest way to describe how powerful this chip is Which is insane for a phone
Love how u didnt include androids phone when u spoke of devices that been had usb type c u just said laptopsdidnt wanna downplay iPhone and talk about its always late arrival to the feature club
what about the immersive video capturing compatible with the Vision Pro mentioned at the end they are using those two cameras to capture 3D
so is the camera actually 48mega pixels or is it just a 48mp sensor  So is the camera still 12mp
I switched from iPhone to Android and there is a part of me that misses it I got an s23 u and I hate how many apps just came preloaded Its like 2 messaging apps 2 browsers 2 voice assistants 2 wallet apps and thats just to start Like you have your Google sign in and Samsung sign in  It was a lot of stuff Where as apple was like heres everything Its all there and works seamlessly Their os just works My android seems to have a bit more bugs Like random things happen Also apple does beta and dev betas 100 better than android phones do There is no doubt there If I still had my 12 pro max I would probably have switched to a 15 pro max But my s23 u seems good enough that I dont have to switch back quite yet
Iphone die herd
Oh no Bring back traditional mechanical mute button
Still on the 13 pro and honestly its a pass for me still its interesting to see the features coming to the 15 and 15 pro  max but not enough that I care about an upgrade
Im in camp dont care at all bc the changes dont move me but Im also camp its time to get a new phone after 3 years  dammit apple here is my money
Fast charging is not good for battery life
USB 20
Blacks are always the biggest shills
Impression unimpressive
Im on Camp  Andoird has had this for years  they quiete literally have My S23 Ultra runs circles around this thing lol
Im so sick of seeing these tiny design changes I want something new so bad Ive even let my eyes linger on a Samsung walking by 
"OMG  Ive been holding on upgrading my iphone 12pro max 3 years now waiting for a new iPhone that is different redesigned a phone that doesnt look the same as the previous versions since the iPhone 11 and this is once again the SSDD  If you dont what that means Goggle it
And Now Im gonna have to wait yet another year hoping that next years iPhone is not once again the same thing with a few internal changes here and there"
The fact that you said new design with a straight face lol
Does this mean that they are using iphone 15 display from the iphone 14 pro last year that has 120hz but dialed it down to 60hz to seperate the pro model else the regular ip15 would be the best value for money iphone
This should be my new phone come spring I am due up for one
Apple being a technology company should deliver the best on the market  This release is a disgrace
I think ill skip the 14s This year IM happy USBC  is finally on the iphone
"from 14 pro to 15 pro theres not enough differences
same zoom nits battery charging 20w design capacity usbc is more trouble buy new cables"
Look exactly same as 14
Still cant do multitasking Shame on Apple Cheap android phones can do it
Apple is boring now with same design for the last 4 years or so they should try something different but anyway thats just apple
Yeah i think they could put fast speed charging in all iPhone 15 models i mean its 2023 gotdangit It was fun to see that Apple quoted you on their Keynote in Apple Event 23 WorldWide spread is never wrong even tough you got at least the same amount of subscribers as them
dont care at all but love your vids but Im more a pixel guy
I agree missed opportunity to not include Thunderbolt 4 on the pro models
So no reason to get a 15
how much was he paid to put not just usb c lul
Thank you to the european comission for the USBC
Disappointed in Ankers charging cables bought the 6 cables for my kids IPads and the one lasted about a month before it stopped working  The regular thinner 3 Apple cables lasted years eventually coming apart the coating at the connector Hopefully they improve the quality Just tried them based on all your guys reviews and promoting them thought what the hell lets try them out But yeah
So nothing inherently new
SHALL I UPGRADE FROM 14 PRO MAX TO A 15 PRO MAX FOR A BUTTON ERRRGGGGGGGGGGG     DUNNO
21M views in three hours Holy shit
How much for the RAM in Iphone 15 Pro Max
Been waiting for this Ty
"now iPhone 15 Pro max and Macbook Air M2 price different more than 200

Of course  iPhone is more expensive"
"Apple milks the system once again 
Well done apple "
im keeping my 12 pro max
Having a custom button with a fixed action irrelevant to the app that you are using is outdated and pretty much useless feature They should have either kept the silent button or made the action for this custom button changeable based on the app you are running not a fixed action
We can thank the EU for that USBC Not an idea Apple wanted European win 
"LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT
So they gave you an iPhone 12 design 10 faster than the 14pro max with a USB C WITHOUT FAST CHARGING
BOY OH BOY HAVE I EVER BEEN THIS UNDERWHELMED SMH"
This black is apple fanboy
It the same I dont care
USB c is legitimately making me think about switching back to iPhone for the first time in 12 years so even if its the only notable change its a pretty great one
11121314 Ive updated every year for the last few years because each year had something that I really wanted even if it was just a color but this year I think Ill sit it out and wait for the 16 next year  That natural titanium is nice and I like that its a lighter phone but I just dont think theres enough here this year
Apple no longer innovating
"Nice review as always Why they didnt add faster usb to basic model I have no words how greedy this looks like If I switch to a new iPhone from SE 3 then it has to have usb 3 speed and low price 

No fast charging  Are they nuts In the flagship models Anyway I limit in my SE3 charging speed because I dont need it and I want to have better battery health comparing to my previous SE2 and battery degradation because of fast charging 84 available in exactly 2 years I limited charging speed by buying a usb A to usb C adapter and using normal cable that came with phone and any charger or laptop port Its hard to get usb c charger that doesnt have fast charging When you have it than its mandatory to charge your phone with the fastest speed no matter what Thats silly

action button I hope its more clear what the actual status is than with previous switch design that you ended up walking the whole day and didnt know someone was calling "
Cant remember the last time I cared about an iPhone ever since Steve Jobs passed the manic went away but we dont have ma y options all phone do the same thing
"Still not having any fastcharging is really surprising
If that benefit isnt there what is encouraging people to make the switch"
Lol usb C WWOOOWWWWW
Any improvement to battery capacity 
So this year we got the 15 pro and 15 pro max along with redesigned last year iphone 14 pro and max with the nametag 15 and 15 plus Thank god I went for S23 waiting for this phone would have been a disaster
Is single press and hold the only option for the action button There is double or triple press
just usbc
The thing is who can really afford this considering the financial crisis
"Its so cool to see that your Quote Made it to the Opening presentation Your the GOAT now
With that being said id like a Honda Accord 20202023 as one of your Loyal Supporters"
Marques you got mentioned in the first two minutes by Tim Cook himself What a moment to sit back and just reflect on Wow Also  USB 3 speeds on standard iPhone models will be strange I think most people who buy them wont use them
USB  C but USB 20 speeds 
The new UWB its awesome
"Im in camp I do not foresee myself ever getting an iPhone
However it is still really nice to see Apple making these incremental changes year on year
This years updates seem like nice quality of life things like the USBC port and action button
The slightly smallerlighter build especially for the Pro is really nice to see too a rare step in the right direction
The iPhone making improvements also applies extra pressure to the likes of Samsung to improve their products in the end everyones a winner"
Totally upgrading from my 13 Pro to the 15 Pro Max once it drops with Verizon I wanted to get the 14 Pro but even an Apple employee told me that Id be better off upgrading to Samsung since the only benefit wouldve been the island That USBC is a huge deal for me since literally everything else in my house is USBC
Which is your favourite colour Tempted by natural titanium
As a hardware nerd Im feeling kinda mid with the generational improvement on the SOC between A16 and A17 Qualcomm now has an opening to catch up in either this or next generation
Im leaving apple
Unless Accessories for Phones are  were hardcoded to a Connector AND an OS then there shouldnt be a necessity for new dedicated iPhone 15 USBC Accessories to be manufactured  Youd now just be buying what was essentially the Android Version instead Like a FLIR Thermal Camera Module
I want a Iphone mini  Im getting sick of these enormous phones
Hey I know its unlikely this will be read but I wonder if the reason the base iPhone is stuck at USB 2 speeds is because Lightning operated at that speed Perhaps theres a limitation with the SoC
My iPhone 13 had 88 battery health  Ill keep it till its down to 80  Maybe the iPhone 16 will be for me  Id rather put that money into a new PC
Same boring iphone
Add blur to a picture after the picture was taken is new Wait where have I seen this before Oh yeah Android 
Why do you Amerimutts even need to watch apple reviews Youre not going to buy anything else anyway
I may save up for the AirPods Pro 2 with USB C charging case and upgrade my iPhone 14 Plus to the 15 Pro Max in the future I like my new 14 Plus already
You want my credit card  LOL
Im REALLY curious how the MKBHD quote happened behind the scenes Did they just do it Did the inform first Ask
Remeber what he was saying about Samsung flagships Very biased Apple blogger
Surprisingly Glad they did not make an Ultra or Fold I like folding phones but I dont know about a folding Iphone
Funny no one is talking about the new lor Feature to record prores 4k 60 with log on external usbc storage
Fast charging on iPhone 16 pro series lmao will just stick with my 14pro
apple is for cell phones what ea is for games pay to win and a bunch of microtransactions nasty company
"I jumped ship from Iphone around Iphone12 I was tired of the upgrades being minimal focused mostly on upgrades for the camera 
I went with the Z Flip3 and now im on the Flip5 and i dont think im going back"
Made it more repairable The iPhone Apple did that 
wow so the one thing ive missed since switching to android after a 6 plus is now gone well that sucks i supose
Much ado about nothing
its all BS
Not impressed by the 15 I was expecting a bit of change with the cameras not the same as 11 12 13 and 14
Im personally excited about console quality games being natively playable on the phone Thats pretty big imo Like yeah other phones are fast but this is the first with console quality
Good brief overview Really interested to see how good digital zoom is from 120600 mm I usually travel with the latest iPhone Pro Max and a super zoom As APPLE gives us more reach the need for the second Camera decreases
Apple really dont have anything to offer anymore They just released a 12 with USB C and titanium Incremental chips and storage Absolutely nothing of real value
Did regular 15 get 120 hz
Also its harming a leg to get a iPhone fixed Maybe they should make it more affordable to fix
Everyone just forgets the unique feature of base iPhones the fixed 60hz display You barely see this feature on other flagships
iPhone 15 Pro Max in natural titanium for me right now Ive always been space grey or black so I might go for the black once I see it in the flesh Either way Im getting one Its my annual treat to myself
So question about the customizable physical button can it be made into a physical shutter button for the camera
"I wii keep my 13 pro until iphone has superfast charging feature
because i dont like iphone pro max line up I do prefer iphone pro line up since my hands are smoll"
I still hate Apple attitude to fuck EU customers so in EU we pay more and we got less why Because EU customers pay more to keep the US model at the same price every year Why in EU models Apple remove the 5G mmWave Ok we dont have in EU but if I pay like 200300 euros more 1489 euros for 256 pro MAX instead of 1199 dollars in euro is 1116 euro means I have money to travel in the US or in Japan for holiday or work where mmWave is used so in roaming I can use the best 5G tech BUT NO HEY U DONT NEED THAT Think also the fact that Apple removed the charger and the price are the same WTF
"All these phones are the same in terms of being a smart  phone 
every new phone thats coming out are predictable Upgraded battery camera processor  screen and operating system Nothing revolutionary like 3d projection The flip phone to the touch screen was a big change Everything after the first touch screen is just marketing new phones"
Gonna pick one up the 13 that is
can you give me phone
Not a greattimeto be an iphone user with these bs chamges That natural color is hideous
jus get a Android phone the samsung line is really good I have the fold z 4 I love everyone Gives me compliments on it im scared im sticking with samsung
"before version 14 there was a switch like on your phone which only had one function  That is activate and deactivate silent mode  An analog switch like the one you have on your phone cannot be turned on or off accidentally or arbitrarily
 Now that a new button has been installed there will be a possibility of pressing it arbitrarily or accidentally  And on top of that you can associate new functions with this button  To be honest its stupid
 I have such features on my phone Samsung but I turn them off completely because accidental clicks happen and apps open that you didnt mean to open and its annoying
 And so I think this update is completely inappropriate  The mute switch was the main feature of the iPhone  Now everything looks like Chinese solutions 
In general for those who are not sure what Im saying I can let you use my phone "
I dont take pics and have no social life so Ill pass
Make the cameras flush Surely wont add much thickness
The fact that the standard models STILL have a 60Hz display especially  at that price is just ridiculous And Im saying this an an Apple user not an Android fanboy
USBC  biggest Update  Forced by EU
"Ive been waiting for this  
Im purchasing the 15max pro asap I am ready for an upgrade as I make commercial videos  for Monas Granola Regis University Denver and now a new Tesla series "
Wow a 8 year old Port and a briter screen Thatll be 1800  smh only apple
what is the last 2 options on the action button
The Kim Kardashians of phones congrats I phone fans on the biggest charging port  upgrade evernever mind the slow charging im sure apple will upgrade that too after 10 years
Do people realize for USBC existed for years Literally The only reason they did was because if laws literally the laws This isnt groundbreaking because of USBC
iphone from india with no major upgrade    no thanks 
Im in camp dont care but end up getting anyway lol
749 anyone else thought the switch to titanium meant the entire body was one piece of titanium kinda disappointed its not the glass on the back is truly the weak point of the design
Copy paste iphone 12
Im in the Camp Dont Care at All Ive been an iPhone user for years until I began to use the Galaxy S23 Ultra I was planning on upgrading to the IPhone 15 pro max but based on the specs dont come at me Apple Slaves I feels its gonna be a downgrade from my S23 Ultra
does anyone know where i can get the iphone wallpaper that he is using for this video
Dude forgot that the baseline cheap iPad has got usb type c
Tbh they havent given me a good reason to upgrade my iPhone 12 Pro Max
Dude theres a reason I keep coming back to this channel  So well done  Im going to have to see how the pro max feels in my hand but Ill be upgrading my 12 pro to a 15 pro of some size  Thanks for this
Ehhh
"in fact the usb 31 which is  present in the 15 pro has speed of 10gbps 
whereas usb 20 has which is present in 15  15 plus has speed of 480mbps
on the other hand the old samsung flagship came with the usb 32 which has speed of 40gbps 
its just uneven all the way it need to be same in all series
edit
i forget they set usb 30 
usb 31 has 20gbps"
"It appears on the face of it as nothing burger phone I will stick to my iPhone 11 still works fine I was tempted to replace it but I also have S22 Ultra and I am sort of fed up with me being the product Google sells as opposed to me buying a product
I will see what the S24 Ultra gives me next year as I always go with the even numbers of Samsung Other than the S7 curve which had Samsung lenses and screws in case

If the Samsung S24 Ultra is a nothing burger I may go with the iphone 15 max just for security Bluetooth LE aside"
The new iphones are so bad tbh hardly anything new
I dont understand the hype over USBC for the iPhone Literally havent used a cable to charge my iPhone in years only charge wireless with MagSafe
I feel like apple made this release intentionally bland They make so much money off the lightning cable and theyve been forced into switching it out Theres no incentive for them to make the 15 anything special so people go out and get an iPhone that no longer needs a cable they make A LOT of money on
Incredible Review as always But not upgrading from my 14 pro max
I can predict the iPhone 16 they will surely have USB 30 next year as they introduced dynamic island for non pro models in iPhone 15
Apple will die one day because of lack of innovation Remember my words
please i need faster charging speed
Disappointing Apple need to up their game
The 2000 nits brightness is in the iPhone 14 not only the 15
One of the most incremental updates ever When USBC is the headliner you know theres absolutely nothing else to talk about 
4K 60p ProRes Log recorded on an external USBC SSD is the big story here
I know this is weird to say but I truly appreciate when the iPhone is heavier because it feels a bit more premium
Welcome to 2011 Apple fans
"Not worth it 
so imma keep using my iPhone XR  and wait until next iphone event and see if theres something thats worth usingbuying"
Yeah Im getting one but its because I have an 11 pro that holds 60 battery life and figured it could hold on for another month or so
"The usb speed on low end ohone is such a dirty cheap truck by apple 
They should be boycotted just for that anti consumer move
Shame on apple"
Thia new iphone has nothing new about it
Im going to keep rocking my 12 Pro Max 
Got an idea when you showed the focal length feature apple could develop a setting customisation  app for these kind of personalisations this would immensely lower development cost no
Surreal to see a usb port Really
Its strange that you didnt know whats everywhere  European Union made a law that all smartphone brands are mandated to ship make their phones with usbc port
Yawn apple with your incremental upgrades
Still waiting that iphone 3 to iphone 4 leap New apple products are not bad they are very easy to use and effective but thats it The want factor is not as strong as before
I have the 12 pro and was waiting for the 15 pro to come out before I got a new phone But Im debating if its really that big of an improvement to go for the 15 pro instead of the 14 pro
60hz 
"Apple never ceases to amaze me about how good and mediocre they can be 

Dont get me wrong Im very glad they finally have usb c But no fast charging and usb 2 on most models I thought Apple was supposed to be better than the competition but they dont act like they want to be"
iPhone noob here Ive had an iPhone 6 from new until now Yes bending and touch disease have been a normal part of my phone experience for years I want to upgrade to the iPhone 15 and was wondering if the iPhone 14 Otterbox Defender will fit I work outdoors and need that level of protection for my new investment immediately Can someone help Thanks
Theyre now copying samsung usb c port lmao
"It has a bixby button
no fast charging 
no charger

hmmm 

regular has the same chip as last year

Hmmmm

So basically they just released one new phone the pro

The regular 15 is actually the 14 with the dynamic island and usb c"
so they can give it to the next iPhone duh
What could apple possibly add thats more interesting how about fullscreen Im gonna die and they still will think releasing a phone with holes in its display is acceptable by steve jobs standards
what cam do you use
Yea Deff copping this Gotta get rid of my SE 2
Its pretty scummy to not include the USB 3 chips in all of the new lineup Like most of the general public doesnt know the difference between USB standards they just know the connector and they assume USB C  the newer faster USB Apple knows this and they know people are going to buy the new iPhone largely because of that feature not realizing that theyre getting no data transfer upgrade It just feels like nickel and dimeing people like how much would a USB 3 chip have added to material cost 50 cents
I prefer HUAWEI mate60 pro than brand old apple15cuz Ive been using Apple since 2014 but as of 11 Apple looks the same I would say A waste of money to spend on the same movie all the time
Shower thought now that we have gotten to the point of minuscule improvements on new models why dont companies start using their billions in RD to offer the same great product for a lower and lower price Lets be honest it doesnt take Apples RD budget to change a charging port and a camera lens but radically innovating manufacturing to offer the same phone for less money while maintaining the same profit margin would be a win win for everybody Especially when you consider that Apple is really popular in the European and North American markets while its presence in developing countries is marginal such a change would give them access to a multiple of the customers they already have probably benefiting them even more than the consumers
I really want to know if charging is MFI cable limited Nobody seems to be talking about that
 congratulations Marques Brownlee on being mentioned yesterday  AND this had BETTER NOT BE a puffpiece
iPhones have been just meh for a while now
"embarrassing to call that a new phone 
Fan boy Marques try so hard to make a positive advertisment"
I have been using Xsmax for like 4 years now and its hard to see that this would be the last update for this iPhone
"This year no product red iphone 15
Red is one of the if not the brightest colour"
Man why did you use a cheap ass 30pin cable as a reference
The camera phone is here haha
Im looking to get a new phone i currently have a S21 Ultra Do you guys think this Iphone 15 pro or pro max would be a good upgrade
No fast charging gotta have something new for the next phone
Amazing video New Iphones just dont worth the upgrade for my 13 pro its a 14 pro with polish sides and type c One of the most boring release ever
Not worth changing imo I was think of changing from Android to iPhone if this years iPhone had significant changes other than USBC but guess Ill wait next year
This is my go to spot for tech reviews Thanks for the content Marques
"Is the a17 Pro 3nm all that its cracked up to be  I dont think so

Its supposed to be a huge bump in speed at a Much smaller process which should enable better efficiency  But doesnt look like it is otherwise there would have been a 15 pro mini  Its the perfect opportunity to reintroduce the mini based on the extended battery capabilities alone but there isnt  Which tells me 3nm isnt where its supposed to beyet  

Would have been nice to get the mini back it wasnt good before because of the terrible battery life but I hoped 3nm would solve that problem  Maybe next year with improved efficiencies and undervolting the iPhone 16 mini will make a comeback  "
Seeing the action button many years ago i used to have a 35mm plug with button that can map functionalities to it Kinda miss having it
Love your model for the camera demo
Too complacent 
I know he is in the Apple ecosystem and he get free apple stuff but he should just tell it as it is its the same phone as last year
looks like CPU has huge boost but GPU is actually on par with Gen2 and leaks suggest that Gen3 will have 50 faster GPU than gen2 that means that A17 will be left in dust on graphic side by Gen3 and I believe that leaks are accurate as its the same person which leaked Gen2 specs and those were accurate and the gap between Gen3 and A17 will be bigger than what is on current gen chips good news for Apple fanboys A17 is safe on CPU side as Gen 3 will be significantly weaker still a bit better than gen2 but no match for A17 Qualcomm chooses gamers and actually its good as Android gaming phones are insane
You are struggling to give new features because there are nonesame phone with new number releasedno innovation from apple
does the pro version has the lidar
fkn hilarious how all those big influencers be likenot just type c xD
Apple fan here since iPhone 2007 Must say Im feeling very flat with new apple products Just more of the same
Excited about the 15 Pro Max 8GB RAM more years of software support USBC compatibility and simplicity and titanium case only because of the reduced weight 3nm A17 should be more efficient well see how this impacts in battery life iPhone 15 confirms my practice of updating every 4 or 5 years
Tbh USB speeds dont matter because not many people plug their phones into PClaptops lol
so disappointed in waiting for this phone not worth buying
Whats the charging speeds
Congratulations on being quoted at the Apple event Amazing achievement imo Goes to show all the work you do behind the scenes the work people dont see to make it all come together so nicely is recognized
Omg usb c
When is someone gonna step up and say it that apple the company is GARBAGE Worst company in the world
Im gonna get the pro max
They got rid of the 13 mini Rip 13 mini and my wrists  wtf APPLE
"With the longevity of these newer phones you are looking at at least another 7 years of lightning cables for sale
It wouldve been nice to see them use 1 press two press or three press to give the action button 3 options"
Im not surprised that Apple would kneecap their base phones and give their most expensive phones the actual speeds youd come to expect from USBC Apples logic is amazing
Did I miss it or did they emphasize privacy less in favor of environmental impact this keynote Not sure if that represents a broader shift in focus or was just the specific messaging for this event
Hour and half is not fast charging wow
Will the USBC cables need to be MFI certified
I think Apple will use the normal a17 in the normal iPhone 16 next year So the pro users dont feel like they should not have bought the 15 pro
Thanks for the video but who cares any more about again a new iphone 
This is the most boring iPhone announcement I have ever sat through Weall know iPhone is stuck in the evolutionary phase but man these things are just such bolt ons that existed for years on Android
Apple is like Sony Cameras Incremental upgrades and everyone goes crazy for the new devices lol
Imagine wasting your 999 for a new USBC  now I know why their government wanted to kill Huawei
Basically androids are still better  
I went back and forth between the S23 ultra and this new iPhone and I just cant switch to iOS Im too ingrained in android For me its the better os and ecosystem
Iphone 16 will be able to create USB tethering with connection to wifi xDDDDDDDDD
Probably they keeping the thunder bolt for the next year just as the ipad
iPhone upgrades arent as necessary as they were in the past Not enough features to make a big difference Still rocking my 13 pro max and love it USB C is cool and I like the new action button and titanium however those wont justify an upgrade for me Ill wait till iPhone 16 and think about it
Definitely staying with my 13 Pro for now I just love the baby blue design
The back glass being replaceable is huge I saw sooooo many people with cracked phone backs  It was very anti repair and anti environment because people would have to replace perfectly working iPhones completely because of it
What about camp I care but I cant afford a new phone so I wont be getting it
Everyones favourite tiktok machine got more expensive
The action button can now have Google assistant or chat gpt with a shortcut Nice
As much as I like those battery chargers I still havent forgiven Anker Eufy for the security camera tracking fiasco
Man Ive been waiting for this video Thanks
"I had hoped that they would release a new iPad 

However now I am in a dilemma of figuring out if getting the iPhone 15 Peo Max is worth it I still rock my iPhone 12 Pro Max in blue I told myself that I wouldnt buy a new phone if Apple discontinued the blue colour but no I was wrong 

Then which model All of my devices are Pro leagues but now I am considering just buying the iPhone 15 not the pro and max version The advertisement for the pro and maxs this year was heavily focused on camera quality But for normal people like me is it even worth it"
When i had a galaxy Id alway get clowned when i asked for a usbc and Ive been saying iPhones are gonna switch to usbc but they didnt belive me
Would love a louder speaker bigger screen size small notch and to even have the ability to add 5 apps to the home dock
I dont see a reason again to upgrade from iPhone 12 Pro
Unfortunately your opinion regarding Apple is compromised It is quite likely that you will alleviate any type of heavier criticism of the company since there is clearly  as seen yesterday  a closer relationship between you and the brand Everyone has a price
Im part of the Apple Upgrade Programme so Ill get the 15 Pro as my last phone I hate the mute switch thats why Im going with the Pro for action button and USBC 30 faster speed
I want this ipbone and i forever been with Google
i wish the Pro model iphones came in fun colors like the regular models the most fun colors the pro have had was the blue pro 14
Normal people dont want smaller bezels everyone uses a case
This one is a pass
same phone just with usbc
Do a poll to see whos in which camp Dont care at all vs Totally getting one of these
Verizon has been sending me 2 emails a day for2 months telling me that Im ready for an upgrade to an iPhone 14 Now that I know what the 15 has I will be upgrading to that
Wow Apple has make a Statement
Just so you know all iPhone 15s have USBC whether Pro or not
I wish we could get a lightning version Ive been a technician for a long time and lightning ports are way more long lasting than any other port
The most boring yet exciting smartphone in the whole world
Good overview and congrats for being quoted by Tm Cook well deserved  Now that you have apples attention could you please tell them to stop saying this is the most advanced iPhone ever made its self evident that it is more advanced than the previous versions  its called an upgrade for a reason Other than that nice upgrades and keep doing the great job Marques
"This eco system is exactly why I havent upgraded my phone since my Note9 in 2018my wife has the 13 max and that does nothing my Note9 doesnt do equally or so closely it makes no difference My last apple was the 4I was looking at maybe getting another Apple but not sure this is it maybe the 14 Pro is wiser money  beyond the USB C   Apple not making it a compelling purchase especially as my Note9 still works perfectly 

The concerted effort Apple has gone to  to prevent repairs outside of the Apple centre also makes me apprehensive to get back into their eco system "
The winner isThe EU
Apple behavior with USBC is about the same as mine when my mom tells me to clean my room
iPhone 15 Pro looks nice but I think I might miss the size of my 13 mini if I upgrade  Oh decisions decisions
lol innovation is ded
Love that the seemingly biggest change USBC was something Apple was forced to do and otherwise this would have been a pretty boring iPhone year Maybe Apple should thank the EU
"They spent a lot of time talking about already existing features like Ceramic Shield
And even reused parts of the WWDC video"
So basically my dude says iPhone 15 is the same as last year dont upgrade He also says Apple is forcing you to buy the pro max to get a noticeable change in the camera and spend more money But their marketing is just perfect they prioritize Titanium body which to an average user makes absolutely no difference and they let you think that buying that will be accompanied with status and make you look rich although you barely make ends meet every month I will stick with my iPhone XS which I got as a corporate phone since 2017 and I am perfectly fine with it
"I cant believe you just glossed over their showcase of RE8 and RE4 remake I just called it a game with fast ray tracing

That was like the biggest thing from this presentation next to USBC

The recent released high fidelity remake is running on your goddamn phone now
The fact that that doesnt blow your mind shows how out of touch you are with gaming in general

I mean actual gaming not mobile games"
I know I could be wrong but I only been watching the titles of iPhone 15 videos and it seems the biggest feature is switching to usbc That is extremely underwhelming besides the mandatory camera upgrade
Boooo lame same iPhones again
Damn thats amazing i really like the new titanium design new lenses new camera sensors just didnt like one thing that is off course the prices because i cant afford one well not me but many of us 
OnePlus got absolutely roasted in 2016 for putting USBC in their 12 phone but keeping the internal USB2 speeds
Android has that portrait mode for years
"Innovation  USB c 
No thx 
But as long there are sheeps   there will be trimming"
Ive never understood the hype behind usb c the promise of faster charging and transfer speed means nothing to me As an iPhone owner I never sync my phone and I always wireless charge Anyway I actually enjoyed having lightning because I have so many devices that use it
Im literally cumming Ive been waiting for USBC on iPhone for YEARS I dont care about any of the other upgrades or features I can FINALLY use just one universal charging cable for everything I own Im going to be getting the pro not max I like the titanium look and if they had a pro mini Id buy that in a heartbeat I prefer smaller phones
"Will be waiting for indepth reviews Im very much interested about the 5x zoom of the 15 pro max and also how long itll take for a full charge etc 

Currently have the 14 pro max and the only thing that I dont like about it is its weight Its so heavy thats why Im planning to get the 15 pro but its only 3x zoom so lets see what will happen "
Flir one pro  Argh
Not getting one Not different enough from my 13 pro max
Camp i dont care and its interesting that Apple still adds things we all know from different android phones and claims to be the first one or at least that the feature is something new like the new configurable button I saw a lot of phones and even my oneplus nord gen 1 has more or less the same feature having an hotkey to quickstart applications I am not hating and I like the idea to make more things a lot easier and increasing the speed of usage If It wasnt Apple and their incompatibility with any non iOS Apple devices
They weirdly didnt show all the colours available for the pro models After the event I wasnt sold on the titanium colour but they do it in dark blue and thats really nice Not sure on the silent switch going though Ill miss it Being able to look at something physical on the phone to see whether its silent has essentially been a part of my life since 2008 Gonna be a weird change
To be honest Apple is getting to complacent and people are just scared of change If they are going to keep giving us the same design they dont need to release every year but I can say I appreciate your reviews and your breakdown of different technology equipment Before I buy certain things I will see if you did a review on it and watch it because you are very detailed and honest
Stop using Anker as a sponsor
As a long long time Apple user Id like to say FAHQ apple
Now it feels worth it to upgrade my 13 its a shame that the prices in Brazil are absurd for iPhones 
The base iPhone 15 is now so good that for most users there is really no significant reason to buy the Pro anymore I have always bought Pro models but will now happily settle with the base model
Boring  iPhones nothing worth buying Samsung FOLD 5 HAVE SO MUCH MORE AND Z FLIP apple played out and to far behind samsung Dont waste your money iphones being Banned 5yrs not one folding phone every thing he wanted is in samsung phones plus when you buy apple phones you still paying samsung they to far behind in tech
New iphone 15 is like renamed iphone 14
gimme pink iphone pleaseeeee
MKBHD strolling around using RED Camera Super cool
Man lets stop the cap and stop hyping up these S series 040  type upgrades 
Headline feature usb c LOL
60hz again
Totally unimpressed USBC isnt a reason for me to toss all of my Lightning cables in the trash Also not a reason to invest 799 or more in a purchase Apple even recycled the A16 chip from a year ago New 48MP camera is useless with only 2X optical zoom Ill keep my iPhone 12 mini Slowly finding smart phones to be more and more useless beyond phone calls and texting
Camp theres still no DeX analogue so it still isnt a professional grade product
by the way actual price increased by some stupid amount in all the other countries cept US
no prblm if ur iphone type c cabledoesnt support fastcharging u can always replace it and use fast charging type c cable from an android phone so no worries anymore
Wow ground breaking iPhone release 
Im definitely skipping this generation unless my 13 breaks but USBC is the reason I dont see myself waiting 5 years for an upgrade
I have an iPhone 13pro Im in the let me see the reviews and see if its really worth getting I dont know yet thanks  cant wait to see more
Did anyone else see the TikTok of the other guy filming Marques using his red camera
RIP to the guy who bought the First USBC iPhone for 86000 on eBay
Frankly the only reason Id update my phone from my iphone 13 pro is if my moms iphone 8 which was my old phone finally dies and she needs a new phone lol 999 is not worth it for the usbc lol The action button to shortcuts seems pretty neat tho but again not worth the price
Pretty Meh  if u ask me
if they do anything higher than 20W charging for the 15 Pro they wont have anything to put in the 16 Pro
"I bet apple is salty as all hell  
But still watch them make a new USBC 20 and have us all get new chargers"
I mainly love the feature of precision tracking of friends or such in crowds That is currently a problem that often occurs that even with location I dont find them because theres like a 70 meter radius in which they can be
Appel only switched to usb c because of a new eu law were all electrical devices need usb c or they wont be able to sell in the eu given the usa is big but thats nothing compared to the size of the eu so appel have kind off been forced to go usb c
Still at 60hz tho
The lack of thunderbolt on the prop phones is a wild mistake on Apples part
Iphone 15 pro seems like the actual Iphone 15
Think Im going to get the 14 pro for the low now This 15 aint it
that looks like iphone 5 and titanium color is frying pan very bad update i am with 11 and maybe i buy 14 pro
Only considering to get the 15 Pro so I dont lose value on my 14 Pro  when the 16 Pro comes out Otherwise I end up paying more to upgrade or switch my device whenever the iPhone 16 comes out
Its funny Im seeing it as this but have you noticed we havent seen a port change since the iPhone 5 Years later we on the iPhone 15 and we not getting another port change until insert year here
Isnt this the iPhone 12 Looks just like that
The EU made them change to usb c lets be honest Thank you EU
You forgot to tell about recording on external drive  Really important
Oh look apple is doing whats everyones has been doing for 5 years already praise apple  Yay
Camp dont need to upgrade for USB C or action button
I dont understand why is pro max users still dont get the cool colors and I like the weight of the latest iPhones
still keeping the 13
Still 60hz on the base models 
I feel they were saving face this year being more focused on the cohesive ecosystem behind the scenes and milking the expectation of new products Sure they delivered a new iPhone lineup and each year we expect itll be the year of the massive change and were kept waiting The hand gestures with the new watch series matching the previewed motions with Vision Pro speak volumes about their future goals It feels like they keep introducing new hardware the general public isnt knowledgable about to give later innovative updates that are just software features they hadnt released yet
Camp will wait for the 17
I may wait for the 16 to come out Im not someone who cares about USBC I didnt care about it on android and I dont here either The camera is what is grabbing my eye
940 what about the double tap on the back of iPhone
Louis Rossmann will give you a better review folks he is just a fanboy or ladyboy I dont which   
Its just a matter of time until Apple introduces wirless charging only on iPhone Just to sell another accessorie
I can see why someone would be disappointed with this if they were already wanting to move from their 13 or 14 but coming from and 11 or 12 like I am it is a much better sell Not everyone buys the new iPhone every year so those incremental changes are a little bit bigger the further back you go
You know there isnt much difference between the iphone 14 and 15 when the main talking point is the usb c port
Nothing really exiting I have the money and I was waiting for the 15 pro buttttt not this year Keeping my 14 pro one year more Small changes for big price Apple lost the way time ago
Yeah nice and welcome updates I may switch from my 12 pro max for the camera battery and usbc But I dont really have to the 12 pro max is still a great phone It just shows how good smartphones have become
Heard Apple quoted marquees what did they say exactly
So NO Periscopic Lens No FAST charging This phone is lame dude 
Ill still be placing my order for a Raw Titanium finish iPhone Pro Max with 256GB on Friday my current iPhone 14 Pro Max is spoken for 
Pretty cool you got a mention  Must feel awesome
I got to hold around my 14 and told people its 15 I got an early copy
This is obviously a quickly put together video but the quality of writing and production is still outstanding
930 imagine being able to customise the buttons colour 
Marques how fast is Samsungs usbc  Mine are 20
"Smartphones are at their peak

Agreed"
Great video I watch a lot of these videos every year but never have the money to buy great iPhones Id like to get iPhone Pro Max one day Ive been using 200400 Android phones
Could I please get the link to the wallpaper from the thumbnail
Apples announcement today said that the new phones will support 24MP default photo size marques brownlee nobody is talking about it This is going to be a big change with larger photo sizes Bigger photos means bigger space needed means bigger storage in the phone bigger storage in the cloud Any thoughts marques brownlee
Im glad Apple is still scamming dumb people out of their money You vote with your wallets and you voted for just sell us the same phone again We will gladly buy it 
Still happy with my 13Pro Will maybe consider upgrading once the rest of my accessories also ditch lightning and the 5x camera makes its way to the non Max Pro phone
Wait so they made a fairly minor software change to let people assign custom functions to a button artificially restricted that change to just the most expensive of the new phones and thats a feature  Surely the question is why isnt this being patched into all phones past and present
To be honest the USBC is handy but I rarely charge my phone through a cord anymore Its mostly been wireless charging
Marques i thought the skit with Mother Nature and the Apple watch ad at the start of the event were pretty wholesome No Comments
The reason for getting rid of the 1099 iPhone Max is to increase the average selling price of the Max model which now starts at 1199 Revenue goes up even if they sell the same number of devices Better for Apple not necessarily for the costumer
im still happy with my 2020se
Same trash as 1 year ago Ill rather stick to my iPhone 12 Pro I was looking forward for a glucose readersensor on the Apple Watch but not even that so yea screw Apple
Honestly this will be the first iphone I skip Weve hit Peak Phone to be fair I dont know what they could do to blow us all away
Map the button to unlock your Tesla
Same iPhone with USBC portSMH
I feel like this wouldve been the perfect opportunity for Apple to say Were going from Lightning to Thunderbolt
"You know whats even more carbon neutral Not buying a new thing every year

 iFixits Matt Zieminski"
Watching apple sht on everybody by offering all the same not evolved phone is funny so keep em coming 
"Apple has genuinely lost its ability to advance in the phone industry and release something exciting and innovative 
20 years from here and they will just recycle their previous designs cough cough they already have  "
in iphone 15 Matte Back glass Type C and 2x zoom and Dynamic Island options can totally make me switch from iPhone 13
"I have got an Iphone 12 Pro Max And although happy with it It was a small step uo from my Iphone X

Now the iPhone 15 which again has barely new features Yes since the iPhoneX certain small upgrades are nice But it is kind of crazy that the biggest chance is a slow 20 USBC port and a better back plate

5 generations since the PhoneX and nothing has really changed This will be the first time since the iPhone 2G that ill be looking around besides Apple"
The natural titanium is the best choice I think
Completely unrelated but I just found out your name is Brownlee  not brownie
I want to dump my 13 Pro Max and go for the 15 Plus That lightweight phone and battery is what I need
How do you think this new iPhone 15Pro USB C with USB3 and getting Apple Music to my stereo at High Res and Lossless
Unknown day of still waiting for the flip phone
Yes im going to upgrade my 11 pro max this year just torn between the 15 Pro or the Pro Max looking forward to that video
no quick charge wtf
As a forever android user I want a second apple device to FaceTime friends so maybe I will get this phone in a few years
Anker sponsor Interesting
Same shit year after year 
I really like my iPhone 14 Pro Max I upgraded from the 12 Pro Max For me it was worth it So Im not upgrading this year And probably not next year either if Im being honest USBC isnt something Id notice because I dont offload photos from my iPhone yet Im 1000 MagSafe charging I would like to know why someone would pick an external hard drive over the cloud though I feel like the cloud is safe right Maybe I should back up all my photos to my iPad Pro since their synced But I am disappointed theres no black ultra 2 though That really has me wanting just a regular aluminum black or red watch until next year because when I got the series 3 in silver I hated it So I upgraded to the series 5 in black and Im still rocking with that today But I want ultra battery life
You have forgotten about refreshrate
Soooooits basically the samenot worth upgrading imo also i was absolutely Sure they were gonna upgrade the charging speeds with the new USB C but i guess not  having a phone that charges at 120W i can never go back lmao
Will get one because I have money left in my expense account I need to spend before end of year Otherwise meh
Last year I upgraded from my iPhone 11 to 14 pro that was a change this one is a meh for me according to my wife my pictures are not so good so that upgrade to the camera is not for me Im happy with my 14pro Ill be back in the iPhone market in 5 or 6 years peace out 
iPhone is the flip phone of smartphones
Thunderbolt will come out with 16 pro next year to have a motivation to take our money from the pocket  And they will say  new innovation from  
"So considering the chip naming in the Mac lineup could the A17 Pro open a gap for an eventual A17 Ultra 

Could this be a sign that were getting an even more premium iPhone soon Maybe one that explores the full capabilities of USBC for example fast charging and thunderbolt connectivity"
"Good to see the action button jumping categories Other than that pretty incremental updates
My bet is that in true Apple fashion thunderbolt is too much of a trump card right now and will be introduced with next years pros
About buying I will be holding on to my 13 mini for the foreseeable future "
Dude I feel robbed just a couple weeks ago I bought new AirPods to replace my old ones Theres no way Im forking over more money for usb c
Wish they would have had some nicer colors for the pro version I also noticed they didnt really touch on battery life either All that was said is all day battery life Ill be keeping my 13 pro max another year and probably buy a used 14 pro max in that sweet looking purple
That whole add portrait mode later reminds me of the Nokia Lumia 1020 I used to love that feature off of that phone Nokia was ahead of its time when it came to the camera and software
"I watched to the event and what stood out to me was them saying about everything is made with recycled material  
It probably cost them nothing to make these phones while turning 100 profit  
Theyll continue to baby spoon feed their customers upgrades lol"
Therefore we can conclude that APPLE STOPPED INNOVATING they cant innovate their products anymore youre just buying a block of metal with Apple company logo stamped on it
Iphone 15 vs iphone 14pro Which would you recomend
So much better than the Verges update
"The iPhone Pro is okay but not a wow effect
I would have expected more from the telezoom camera"
Im definitely waiting for those reviews tho which I honestly didnt expect bc I thought ok I just get the new Pro but than I took a second and thought mh u know what the action button is really not that big of a deal tho and I dont need the 3 Cameras on the back bc when I really wanne take pictures I just always reach out to my DSLR Camera Now the only thing that is keeping me wait for the reviews on all models is the battery life of the 15 as u know it is still the same chip that powered the iPhone 14 Pro last year and everyone said that the battery life was kinda awful on that one But if the battery life turnes out to be great  still waiting for that bigger battery reveal Ill definitely will get the 15 since I am upgrading from an iPhone 11 Pro and yeah Im really thankin the EU in that matter bc if it wasnt for the USBc Port I dont really know if I would still upgrade tho ok the dynamic island is also a nice 2 have but thats literally it Hopefully the iPhone 16 will finally get the 120herz display than Ill have everything I need from an iPhone Bc it is honestly like u said when was the last time u pluged in ur iPhone  I dont shoot in Prores or something so I dont really need the extra speed The only thing that could maybe still convince me to get the Pro is if the Pro would have 8gigs of Ram now and the 15 is still stuck by 6 but even than I might still get the normal 15 because Im so used to having 6gigs of Ram on an iPhone
iphone is behind the times
It is literally and iPhone 13 with a mediocre reskin Thats what it is the phone has been the same for 34 years
Im watching to see if the reviews prove that the new features are worth it
"So theyre Samsungs now 

What did they change on the iPhone Anyone who believes that something changed on the iPhone is an OXYMORON "
I just want google tier ai
USBC is a big headlining feature 
Anybody here often accidentally takes a screenshot while locking the screen or upping the volume on the iphone
New With USBC that look like 14 
Its great that Apple decided to join the modern world with the USB C but the increases in speed and camera quality i dont see why anyone would spend this money if they have a 13 or better Unless you literally just have money to blow and have nothing better to do with it or you are a photovideo junkie which if you are you probably have dedicated equipment for this
So essentially you are paying 200 more dollars for the 5x zoom Is that the only difference between the pro and pro max
did i get u right that there is no fast charging any more
Its crazy how there All the same phone just changed the charger
literally just USBC
Having fast access to the mute feature is too valuable in a business setting to ever switch the action button to anything else
Getting the feeling those iPhone upgrade are getting repetitive owing to the fact that the ecosystem will shift to AR and VR in a few years With a phone you are limited to the actual body of the device but with AR you remove this barrier and legit make it easier for advertiser to get some attention from you seamlessly Little update wont buy still love my SE 2020
fast charging  huh marques i think you forgot  fast charging is the revolutionary perk that will come  with the iphone 16 pro max
Can anyone help me out i am confused in 15 pro n max version which should i prefer plz  help
So another year with the 12 pro
Somebody needs to find a way to put Bixby on the action button
Not worth upgrading my 13 pto
Dude I think your wrong on the slow USB the iPhone 15  pro will support USB 3 
Is 23rd counting the iPhone 5c
Marques That 20W charging is giving 50 of the charge in 30 minutes as per their page Is this not enuf Highly efficient charging
Apple same phone higher price
Its Amazing Apple has been force to include USBC  for GOVERMENTS And the people is thinking that Apple changed that by itself decision Whats wrong with the people Is dude
next year youll get the usb 30 type c version on iphone 16 and 16 plus  apple engineers are so lazy nowadays
just gonna say this LMAO
The 5x is the only tempting upgrade that could push my creativity a notch up but then again is it really an upgrade that holds my already decent output from the last years pro
sadly cant see HUAWEI review here  
"Its a tough one

I really like the dynamic island but the 14 Pro wasnt worth the upgrade 

But by contrast the 15 Pro has that a new design a better camera and significantly better chip and on top of all that it seems Apple increased the tradein value at least in the UK

So its actually a great deal but the 13 Pro continues to be an absolute beast"
"Basically all of my comments 
Who is plugging in their phone for the UsB3 to matter 
Who complained that the sides werent strong enough Vs the back glass being trash 
Action button who requested this 

So I will keep my 12pro max and have no complaints"
Just watched your vid for the updates
"Titanium is only stronger when when referring to fatigue life or ability to retain its shape based on its strength to weight ratio As someone that builds my own bike wheels Titanium isnt nearly as rigid as stainless steel its just more reslient which you could could say is stronger but strength in metallurgy is relative depends on the use case

metallurgical explanation from a total layman to people that probably have no idea what I mean
Sorry Ill explain If youve rode a bicycle basically ever it had stainless or plain steel spokes If I put you on a bike with Ti spokes you might not notice while riding in a straight line until you lean to corner the bike while pedalling hard and notice the metal does this flubberspring thing where it springs and responds to the forces of you and the bike hard to explain better than that Itll usually never snap but as an example you can picture

you can literally tie a Ti bicycle spoke in a looseish knot on a table and stand there for ten seconds staring at it it eventually self corrects and straightens itself  back out into a shallow C with very little extra help you can make it dead straight again in seconds  If you forced a normal steel spoke into a knot its sparespoke bin fodder  or winds up in the in the first aid emergency pouch as a potential basic future splint

There are are no other metals i can think of that can do that I think of carbon as the strongest plastimetal and Ti as the plastickiest metalrubber as another reference if none of that makes sense to you

Thanks for making the best content on Youtube Marques and the Waveform squad"
basically its the same thing as always
No higher refresh rate displays this time too Trillion dollar tech company still stuck at 60 Hz
The upgrades this year are so embarrassingly small even for Apple standards This is getting ridiculous
Hands down THE dullest Apple Event ever Theyve totally lost the ability to wow intruige and innovate Think of what they COULD do with their RD and marketing budget A change of leadership needed there and quickly
My contract is done at the end of the month getting a new phone Love photos 
Alwways come here for iPhone reviews
Ive been adamant about not giving Apple or TMobile another  I went from a 7 to a 12 with iPhone 15 having usb I think its time unfortunately lol
"I almost exclusively use wireless charging but Im sold on the 15 just for the USBC 
They had a whole skit about environmentally consciousness and to me a universal charging cable for all electronic devices is about as environmentally conscious as it gets  Yet they said something to the effect of weve added USB C to the iPhone something weve been adding to our products for years 
Like BFFR  yall were forced and would much prefer having exclusive chargers exclusive tools screws etc etc etc"
Marques really being the best and most honest reviewer
i cant wait to go from a beat up iphone 11 to a brand new iphone 15 pro max ill finally have a battery 
Going to pre order Friday Coming from 14 pro to 15pro
How cool was it that within the first few minutes they featured a quote from MKBHD Congrats on the recognition and success
Thunderbolt and fast charging will come to the iPhone 17 and 18 
guaranteed its still a proprietary  usbc just for apple you cannot use any other usbc other than the one you get bahahahaha
After using Android and Apple ist pretty hilarious that they get away with building 900 phones with 60hz display when even the shitiest budget 300 android has free fast charging and 120hz
so basically iphone 15 is iphone 14s pro
owner of an XS here Totally upgrading to Titanium
Do the new iPhone 15 has a sim tray
I was really looking forward to getting a 15 pro for its lightness However upon looking it up on Apples website its only lighter than the 14 pro and the 13 pro I am on the 12 pro and it weighs exactly the same as the 15 pro Bit of a let down Probably wont be upgrading this year I am tempted by the action button but well see
No fast charging officially but in the spec sheet it says fast charge available if you use higher adapters than 20 W interesting 
I have been considering switching from android to iPhone for a few years now I have been using Pixels since they released and I love them mostly but I have had problems with all the pixel phones I have gotten since the Pixel 2 and had to send in the 6 for repair twice because the screen was faulty Definitely going to wait for reviews but I might just suck it up and finally switch to iPhone
When it comes to usb c the truth is that I dont care for it For me the phone is good enough as it was as I really dont see the need for usb c due to the way I use my phone So its very important for people to understand that while they wanted usb c for a long time it does not mean that the vast majority of the user base wants or cares for it Its like android phones you can do all sorts of things with them but 95 of the user base simply just use their phones for social media web browsing and texting so they are spending 1k on a phone that they never will use to its full capabilities so while people are always screaming at apple or android for things just remember that just because you see a YouTuber say they want something that you want its not necessarily something thats a majority opinion and its why companies like apple always take time implementing things on their phones because its not something that the majority wants as is the majority that makes them the money
Great Now theyre gonna slow down my 13 pro
Now with excessive radiation
"Definitely not
Interested in the new iPhone"
Did he really just say other phones have had USBC for past couple of years  Try several  years That had to be a deliberate omission he isnt that ignorant its literally his job to know these things
"Very bad color waited so much for pro and see this grey color  I am for sure now going for that pink one 
Very much disappointed"
Make a video on the Mate 60 or are you too scared
Honestly I totally expected Apple to be like nah fuck you no ports only wireless charging Im glad I was wrong lol
Like timetraveling to a 2016 phone review minus the camera tech
Of course Apple decided to take something like usbc  find a way to make it a pro feature 
335 I lost my internet connection here last night
Mr Brownlee always the best reviews  We should play disc golf sometime
nah my s9 plus still working
People realizing that the switch to USB C literally just means a new connector and that lightning had all the same functionality Lightning supported high charging speed high data transfer etc The phone itself is what didnt support it
No folding phone
SAMSUNG HAS ALWAYS HAD THAT PORTRAIT FEATURE
Things weve been using on Android since one eternity 
When do we get iOS 17
So pretty much just USBC
No promotion high refresh rate on iPhone 15 is a big L
The base iPhone looks much more competitive now compared to androids
Ifans really go crazy with anything apple huh Its funny actually Apple might release an Ipoop and they would all flock tho that 
Innovation died with Jobs at Apple
"I have a 13 pro max and I find it very big didnt plan on swapping it soon Regardless the usb c did have an impact on me bigger than most of last years upgrades I actually had a 11 pro max and wasnt upgrading  but I got robbed and had to go to the 13 But back to my point among all my devices that over the years have migrated to usbc thats the biggest feature for me having only one cable would be amazing notebooks apple or not my iPad Pro a couple of phones and now rh phone Im not in a rush though if the opportunity shows to swap in a good deal fine if not Ill keep my 13 pro max for a while  And theres more now that the max and the pro are diferente not sure which one IKlinke go for Probably depends on the physical size of the pro 

As always amazing content congratulations on the mentions by Tim You deserve and worked for it Best"
Steel is stronger than titanium titanium has a higher strength to weight ratio so if the volume of steel and titanium are the same the steel will be much stronger
Its the same phone every year with just a little bit of changes reviewing these is pointless
I always plug my phone in with a pc 512gb moto edge plus 2022
Usbc port they still cut corner thats dumb
Camp dont care at all Assemble here
It charges fast enough Nothing wrong with that
Anker products are great
My wallet gets to decide which camp
Mehhh not gonna upgrade from my I phone 14 pro 
Why no fast charging People will be asking why Apple didnt do it years ago and also because Apple will announce it as a new feature next year And now rapid charging and youre gonna love it welcome to 2016
"Yes almost certainly upgrade 12 Pro Max to 15 Pro Max  That mostly for the camera improvements

I was expecting 6X optical but fine Ill take it  Ill be looking forward to hearing how well the OIS works at full zoom

Sounds like the 48Mpix main camera by default takes 24Mpix compressed  Presumably you still need the script to get the full 48Mpix converting from ProRAW"
Nice to see USB C
everything youre wishing they do theyre doing it next year
"Naaah im just gonna pass for this one too
I dont feel there is much of a change just a modified iphone 14 or 13  typical boring apple"
damn video released right on my brithday lets go
I love apple and use to be a fanboy and still use apple but next time I buy Ill be switching cuz of apples rules on web3 apps
So nothing new Ill pass
"Its the same phones from last year just now with USBC
LMFAO"
Everything I hear about iPhones I find myself wondering why people still buy them 480Mb 20W Pfft Is this 2010
if you say this is okay or this is good youre the problem
Titanium alloy can mean a number of thingsas can stainless steel so we dont know which is stronger and Im pretty sure most stainless steels are tougher than titanium
Why does it have to be a friends android phone 
Inovation usbc 
I still have an iPhone X and every year I look at the new iPhone and I see that there is basically nothing really new
Android users are running out to stores to buy spare USBC cables before their price is suddenly inflated due to being Applecompatible
60hz Display
Yeah  big feature Usb C 
Wait the Action button is only on the Pro Phones
I think the headlining feature is that the pro is getting console game ports Games like the new assassins creed are going to run natively on it I think the iPhone could actually become a player in the gaming space if the games run well
Ok i know its not crazy but I love love love the details in your videos every time these little apple crads on the pillows is just nice
Most incremental update ever lol I suppose I shouldnt be complaining seeing as I will be upgrading from the XS Max 
its not HUUUGGEEE  usb is just a charger and no one cares
Anybody got a link to the screensaver on the iPhone in the thumbnail
Usb 3
Im in camp 4 Definitely buying this new iPhone when I can buy it refurbished I think its a great upgrade from my iPhone 12 albeit not a necessary one I can get it much cheaper basically brand new and have them work out all of the new iPhone bugs before I get it But for additional battery screen brightness 2x telephoto and especially the new USBC port  this is the upgrade Ive been waiting for I am excited to see more developers using dynamic island now that its across the whole lineup
So much excitement for a cable that was released in 2014 Way to go for innovation Fast charging next year and something gets removed
Its unacceptable that they are selling the iPhone 15 with a 60hz screen
All those watching from iPhone 12 Pro Max shout out over here
No mini no upgrade
I like that David is willing to model for you rather than you snapping at random Apple attendees lol
"Wasnt there supposed to be a 2GB ProMax I feel like its missing 
Good video"
Will the base phones EVER go beyond 60hz
Apple presents a new phone every 7 months and people are stupid they get it and is the same phone 
Feels more like a S model upgrade Im running the 14 ProMax and Ill just stick with it I do like the changes and they are a welcome upgrade but not worth the switch at this time
How to silentmute your iPhone if the action button changed to do other stuff
"I had a dream that I could record pro audio on a pro iPhone running Logic Pro with a pro thunderbolt port and corresponding pro audio interfaces And it didnt happen 

No 6x optical zoom let alone 10 on S23 Ultra no statement about any increase in RAM and no super exciting new feature other than an assignable action button which I have 88 of on a MIDI controller on my desk Thats no pro iPhone to me"
Im really disappointed that Apple still hasnt included a 120Hz display on the iPhone 15 Its been available on many Android phones for years and yet Apple keeps ignoring it How can they claim to be innovative and cuttingedge when they lag behind their competitors on such a basic aspect of screen technology And how can the youtubers who review these phones be so biased and lenient towards Apple They always praise the iPhone for its design performance and ecosystem but they barely mention the lack of a 120Hz display They act like its not a big deal or even worse they make excuses for Apple They say things like the iPhone doesnt need a 120Hz display because its already smooth enough or the iPhone has other features that make up for it or the iPhone has better battery life without a 120Hz display These are all lame arguments that dont justify the omission of a feature that is standard on most flagship Android phones The youtubers should be more honest and objective and call out Apple for their stubbornness and complacency They should demand better from a company that charges premium prices for their products They should not let Apple get away with such a big missing feature for three years in a row when they rip Android manufacturers for the tiniest flaws
Most ironic event name ever  borefest more apt
The like to the video was given for the efforts of Marques no credits for Apple
Apple Master in Product Feature pain point offering
Im definitely buying it on preorder
Iphone new features and upgrade became just a meme
Another boring upgrade  The 15 isnt significantly different from my 12  Apple has no ambition anymore
Anyone would like to help me to buy iphone
I am one of those people who have religiously purchased every iPhone Pro since the original sometime switching from the regular Pro to the Max in alternative years just to feel like I have something new but this time I am not sure if I am actually going to get the new iPhone based on the review I dont really care if its USBC like my iPad Pro is I dont need to buy a new iPhone so that I get a new cable and I am not sold on the action button yet which I feel is one of those things you will end up hitting by accident when you have the phone in your hands and will be irritating Also I dont like the fact that they saved the special lens feature just for the Pro Max
"I disagree on the stainless steel being strong enough I dropped my 13 Pro Max exactly once on concrete and it chipped the rails

It was in a case too "
Apple artificially bottlenecking USBC bandwidth is hilarious
USB 20 what are we in 2010 Apple never fails to disappoint me Breaking new Apple 15 mini now has microusb
104 one peicee
Id argue Apple doesnt want to admit that USBC is far superior to lightning Thats why they limit funcionality for most users to be just the same as lightning Next year theyll upgrade data and maybe charging speeds and will sell it as if it was a huge invention
They removed the 128GB version iPhone 15 Pro Max because the sale volume might be almost negligible for it I personally dont think anyone would want to get the latest iPhone Pro Max with only 128GB of storage in 2023 Its outdated Plus they can buy more 256gb nand and get better pricing on those too
Totally picking up the blue pro max I do like the usbc its the titanium thats drawing me
imagine buying a 1K phone that only increases performance at 10 thats embarrassing
Imagine not only promoting USB 30 as a feature in 2023 but reserving it for the pro models only  Should be USB 4 across the board like the macbooks have had since forever
Bros do giveaway 
apple pioneered no right side up charging in mobile phones PERIOD
Apple could do much more and update their phones to whats out there now with android but if theydo that then the next years phone wont have anything really new just a slight improvement with hardware or software Phones now are only slighly improving and new features isnt something new any more Apple is simply just a rip off paying maxiunm price which aint a maximum phone
"Yes they did it They did the USB C Just have to wait a couple more weeks and I can finally upgrade this old iPhone to something with some battery and decent cameras 

I think the 15 Pro is finally at the stage where Ill be gaining more features than losing 
Gaining
 Waterproofing
 Really good cameras
 Fancy side button thing
 USB C charging
 Fancy high refresh rate stuff
 MagSafe

Losing
 Force Touch use literally all the time for editing as I write
 Touch ID can unlock phone without lifting it off the table
 Headphone jack my earbuds dont cost 3 figures and dont require charging
 Hardware home button can still exit out if an app crashes

It has taken 8 years for the number of features gained by upgrading to outweigh the features lost 8 years And I still dont know how Im gonna cope without force touch to quickly move the cursor around while typing Not to mention dongle lyfe for headphones And I really wish theyd put a fingerprint reader into the new side button because ugh Touch ID is so much more convenient Gonna be a painful switch 

At least in recent years the battery percentage indicator is back That woulda stressed me out so much if I couldnt see the exact number"
This just makes that iPad 10 even stupider They are clearly gonna kill the lightning port on that next and iPad 10 owners stuck with an Apple Pencil 1 wont be happy 
800 for iphone 15 Where
I have the 14 promax and I just dont see a USBC and a 5x zoom as being enough for me to upgrade Honestly Im so disappointed Im probably going back to Samsung
Watchung this from my S23 Ultra not feeling impressed 
After 2 more iPhone models We now introduce the fast charging with our USBC 3 5 out of 5 on how Apple makes everything sound new
Ive got the 13 and watched the entire keynote last night I felt pretty convinced that the 15 or the 15 pro was a decent enough upgrade for me as I want a better camera like the dynamic island and the performance boost is always welcome Feeling the 14 pro max might actually be the better shout now though
"About USB 3 what do you even plug your phone into a computer for
On Android you can move files around but on iPhone"
Keep up the good work 
Iphone 15 pro max 1 tb the one the im looking for its actually cheaper then 14 pro max 1 tb lol
Lots of obvious businessmanufacturing reasons not to offer the 128gb Pro Max Great video Marques 
The biggest thumbs up is the USBC
Typing this from my iphone se2 its gonna be a big jump anyways but if i dont care about the cameras at all dont game on my phone and already like the mute switch as it is i should go with the regular 15 right Where i live its 250 cheaper last year the difference was 300 than the pro I mean titanium and slightly smaller bezels would be nice slightly more efficient as well Promotion sounds cool but since i mostly watch videos or read stuff i probably dont need it
lame af event
Already preordered the 15 pro max I have a 12 pro max and its the best phone Ive ever had Ive had flagship androids that have never lasted this long I can get 450 bucks for my 12 pro max trade in so I figured I would use that while I still can I dont need to upgrade at all but I dont want to be stuck paying for a full price iPhone in like 5 years Crazy how apple has shown their phones have longevity
While the idea of usbc is cool I dont think the new features are enough to warrant me getting rid of my iPhone 13 Pro Max
I dont care are all lol 
HIGHLY overpriced
Pro phones are getting more attention maybe due to the better sales
Iphone 16 would come at 1100so they made some space for it
When certain YouTubers said that iPhone 15 will be a huge upgrade from iPhone 11 just like how huge the upgrade was from iPhone 6s to iPhone 11 and having been saying that there would be even an ULTRA version it made me realize how greedy those YouTubers are just to add videos into their channel There isnt even a serious upgrade LMAO They know how Apple products attract tons of views and they dont even care if their viewers have been watching wrong information all the time How silly they are
As a 7 user I think its time for an upgrade
omg USBC 30 No Fast charging Apple KYS
1 year old tech is finally available in iphone 15  their ecosystem build when they were at peak is the only reason they are surviving today
"What a surprise Same old bullshit and they pretend its a game changer
It looks the same as last year"
We all know they used your name so that you dont give them a bad name for releasing the same phone with a new name
how does it fare with samsung s23 especially the usbc since thats the main headline
Apple fanboys will buy anything Apple makes 
so a whole lot of nothing A new phone every year from every company is starting to get boring They need to dial it back make phones last longer and announce big new changes every 23 years
iPhone 15 799  Eventually people will wake up Until then Apple shareholders we keep benefiting and cell phone users wont
I was waiting for a new SE 
Not sold May e the standard pro getting the daughter the 15 plus in some absurd color
now im ready to go get a pixel fold
I Switched from s20 ultra to the iphone 14  pro max and man I cant wait for the s24 ultra comes out
FineWoven  plastic cases at leather prices pretending to be a green move
I hope the comment section always open wasnt a slight shade to Apple LOL
Ive been android since the iPhone 4 but that pink one is  dreamy I wish I could have it as my work cell phone lmao
I stuck with the 8 plus because of the button but its getting to a point where I have to upgrade was really excited for the 15 but it dosnt seem epic enough Think Im waiting to the 16 pro max 
It took apple several years to integrate the USB C to the phone Seriously Sorry but a stay with Motorola Moto G stylus 2022 Android all the way
Pixel 7a can do pretty much the same even has some AI skills and costs 13 of the iPhone Pro D
All I know is in the images about the emergency satellite calling they showed a broken down Saab Come on man we already have to pay thousands for new parts you dont gotta knock us while were down
Im not blown away by these changes but the 15 pro max will definitely be a big upgrade from my XR
Still has that insanely big pointless screen cut out The reason id never use an Phone again Whyyyyyy Theres no reason to have a giant piece of the screen cut out like that Zero
 I cant believe TYPE C on iPhones seems like a major upgrade Hello 35 dollar phones in China use TYPE C Its a damn shame
Im in camp definitely getting these Ive been an Android user all my life and I never ever thought Id ever want an iphone But the 15s have just done it for me Im sure that as long as I can help it my next phone is going to be one of the 15s The dynamic island on the base model won it for me Love it
Another great video and congrats on your quote  being used in the opening of the Keynote Presently I have a iPhone 12 Pro Max 256gbs and plan to upgrade to the iPhone 15 Pro Max 256gbs
Looks like its just the USBC
Seems like theres no innovation happening at Apple these days
Titanium is also lighter so I assume they did this because thered be less kinetic energy to dissipate once it hits the ground and hence less damage overall with the titanium being stronger aiding that fact
I was waiting for the reveal just to confirm that I will be purchasing another iPhone 11 Pro Max spigen case
Who needs a 5x when you have the best 3x for portraits I think Apple has made a wrong decision I love 3x and portrait shots I need MKBHD to reply to this
Was Apples tradein already part of the last keynote In any case I didnt notice it It seemed quite new to me and especially the prices were quite high Seems to me as if Apple wants to exchange all devices as quickly as possible to the current version
Still expensive phone
Overall not worth apple is defintely out of the race and would eventually fall out
"New iphone announcement
My reaction "
The real one is to wait for iphone 16 pro max Not worth to upgrade to 15 if you have 13 or 14
I used to be very excited for these releases cos we have ATT and had 2year contracts with them so me and my wife would get a new iPhone every year But now ATT made those 3 year contracts so I have to wait for the next year for a new iPhone for my wife and 2 years more for me So this release is super tepid Also I am stuck with using the lightning cable for 2 more years
As a repair tech easier backglass is great but Im not holding my breath given Apples habit of serializing and pairing everything
so just usb c with yesteryears speeds
Ffs its the exact same phone yet again
Apple wheres the folding phone Damn apple just doesnt change design much
The biggest news I heard was that theyre gonna let you upgrade your iPhone 11 through 14 for just 100200 I believe many people will do this leaving a lot of phones disposed of which I assume they recycle or resell but it seems like a waste of resources
When Marquess favorite feature is a button on the side you realize that there is really not much to get excited about
ITS THE SAME FKN PHONE
Going to dump my expensive gf to buy the phone 
Thanks but no thanks Ill hold on to my 11 Pro Max a little longer
They should sell the all 15s for half price since 80 or more of the parts are 1 year old tech  No more IPhone
YeahIm not getting a new iPhone until they move the notch or watever they call it nowI want a full screennot paying a thousand for upgradesIll stay with my 12 pro max until they do thati kept my iPhone 6until I bought this 12 pro maxso Im willing to wait
Im buying it Just cant decide which one pro or pro max
 Your friends Android phone  
Id feel better about it if instead of me trading my phone in for cash every year they just had you give the phone for free but for everyone a new phone is cheaper Obviously they would be losing out on money but I just see it as a margin they dont really need profit from considering how much they mark up an already easily mass producible item
Will I be able to charge it with my school Chromebook charger
The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max boxes wont have the fast USB 30 cable and will include the slow USB 20 cable so you have to buy the USB 30 cable separately from Apple for 69 
They need to make a new SE with   the same screen as the 13 or 14 plus USB C and a bigger better camera
Its hard to talk for 13 minutes about literally nothing
USB C for da win  lets go dude Now iPhone joins Harmony and Android club 
Basically old iPhone with usb C and new name
The most HYPED BORING Ridiculously expensive phone in the world And I will still buy it
I guess my 6S is finally gonna get a replacement Though kind of sad they ditched the mini That was the perfect size
"Biggest name change in history
iPhone 11  12  13  14  15
Rest are same things"
I dont see any never seen before innovation
Man i really hope it has a slightly better camera and slightly larger battery
Dont worry they saved fast charging for the next iphone so they can boast how amazing is their new product They have to keep some old features for the future iphones since they dont innovate anymore So they going to milk that port as much as possible but little by little
Its usbc andddd titanium 
Aww look at apple finally catching up to Android from 6 years ago Keeep going apple youll catch up one day Pfft
I dont understand like 30 of the vocabulary but how he says it is cool
With that mute button nobody has talked about whether you can do more than one thing with the button such as 1 press mute 2 presses recorder 3 presses
Another year of i phone review getting more viewers than users
Yo btw congrats on the shoutout at the live video event from the man himself Marquess
The s23 ultra in my opinion was more interesting when it came out the iPhone 15 tho seems boring with some minor changes if i should get it its because of the 15 pro max chip
pro max is 10x
I have been waiting for this My X has served me welland I nearly went for the 14 but the upgrade camera was what I was waiting for USBC is a bonus Excited Great review as always thanks 
so they gave type c port which basically an upper midrange in android already been providing to us since ages and on the top of that it doesnt support fast charging and speedy transfer lol not gonna buy it
Titanium isnt stronger than steel its as strong but about half the weight So the pro phones are just as strong as before in terms of metal but lighter in weight than that steel counterparts
No real urge or need to update my watch 8 or pro max 14 Wonder where the next leap will come from
MKBHD was mentioned i heard when Tim was talking about macbook air 15
I just really want them to put Touch ID under the screen
For the first time since 2007 I will not get a new iPhone
"Dude I lost it when ur name popped up
Cant wait to see the studios reaction "
copium
Lost money 
Mid
I want a iPhone 15 MINI Pro
So in 2023 800900 gets you a 20W charger 60hz display and a last year chip  wow great value
The all new iPhone 15 with the action button A button that does what the Apple already does  but you can select one of those features to be turned onoff with this button  yawn its like an Onion video
"A feature that only works with other iphones not necessarily a bad thing
Any feature that only works with this comcept is a bad thing
Samsung has the airdrop equivalent but you have to buy a samsung laptop same shit no thank you samsung laptop is just a windows laptop wtf"
I prefer your reviews as you remain unbiased and impartial you also are not afraid to speak your mind
Time to buy best Phone iPhone 13
Is worth getting this new iPhone or should I go for the 13 pro Im switching from a xiaomi
I cant believe people are celebrating the a type C connector
Not different enough from the 12 for me to upgrade guess Ill wait for the 17
Rubbish of the year
Apple is a scammer paying todays prices for last years chipset in the 15s madness
Good review  Apple  Im yawning  Minimum innovation yearly it seems   Its another release of a blackwhite film color remastered to sale it again  The ground hog saw its shadow again and is going back to hibernate  maybe next year
Whats the fps of the base ip15
"Saving the Portrait Mode info for later use  thats something new
A custom button for any app thats something we already have on some other phones but mute button was Apple Specific
Saving the focal length is new but had sort of the same with other phones by the name of remember last camera settings 
Apple could have added those USB 3 to all models but then they needed to differentiate with pricing
The rest all thinner bezels matt finish round edges are normal and not that to be much revolutionary
Anyway thanks for sharing the premier update"
I think iPhone Pros getting 20g lighter is a big deal here
Definitely upgrading this from a 11 Pro and 12 Pro Max I like to leave it a few years between upgrade as it makes the incremental updates are a nice big step up
The biggest disappointment for me is the immense price difference between the US and EU markets How does 799 USD which would be 744EUR looking at the current exchange rate become 969EUR This is a 200EUR markup just for living outside of the US They have been doing that for a while but this year its really in your face
I love the way he mentioned the word same continuously just to make you understand iPhones are not big upgrade
Grade 5 titanium for a phone is kinda pointless imoyeah it sounds fancy but
Love the Autotrader Tshirt Where can we get those
Hope next spring there will be new pro line with rounded corners so I finally upgrade my 11pro max buddy The only one thing make me think about upgrade is camera but this will wait 
1500 entry version for Max Pro Joke
Does anybody think theyll do another Mini phone ever again Like maybe next yeartwo years the SE will actually be the 13 Mini or something like that Cuz I dont think theyll do a Mini and I love it D
WOW USBC finally
Slow charging on a 15 pro max  what a joke Ill always be an apple guy but that is rediculous
I was really hoping wed get fast charging
Portrait photo thing Pixels are doing this since 3 years Turn any photo to portraits
Saw on 9to5mac that Apple may allow you to limit the maximum charge on the battery in a future update on the new 15s Major win in my book cuz id want to preserve my battery health
I dont even want no fast charging I feel like that hurts the battery
Need review in your table  not watching this
I love new iphones always I am a iPhone 14 pro max user and I am not a professional user For that reason I would say I will wait for a redesign model maybe next year or in two year However I dont see USBC a big reason to move Amazing new feature by the way
Im very impressed this year
I currently have a Samsung s10 and i was thinking of upgrading to the iPhone 15 pro max I usually dont change phones for 4 years So should i upgrade
"It cracks me up that apple takes little things which really are obvious ergonomic and productivity improvements and introduces them over a huge span of time  From a business perspective its great as it forces us to by the next generation What other product do we upgrade every three years which we pay over a 1000 for  But from electronic waste and consumer utility standpoint it is outrageously irresponsible and predatory 

I like how they talk about their carbon footprint reduction through materials use yet their products are constantly obsolesced and are almost impossible to repair 

Lastly as you mentioned USB C was forced onto them by the EU yet they repackaged that setback and spun it as some kind of profound innovation That reality distortion field is in full effect LOL 

Im not saying that Apple doesnt make decent products but they just play the same game of planned obsolescence staying just in parity with other manufacturers  

Who knows by Iphone 25 we might be able to move icons outside of grid pattern

Not a hater by the way but Im also not a fanboy just pointing this stuff out Ill wait for the Iphone 16"
not wonderlust it was lacklust
Dont care at all camp
There is no color on pro that say buy me   Darkness en soulless grannys house
"Apple doing the absolute bare minimum and claiming that it is innovation is nothing short of diabolical and condescending The EU regulations forced Apple to integrate USBC If it were fully up to them youd have to prick your finger and give them blood every time you charge your phone

They deserve to be commended for the use of new 3nm silicon that is actual innovation"
The most boring event in the entire history of Apple The isheep will upgrade just to have usbc
Crazy part is even after 23 year  they are launching in different colours which will be hidden in cover as back is not drop proof 
They just increased the gap between the 15s and the 15 pros this was destined to happen
Big W for EU regulators putting the pressure on these capitalist powerhouses in favour of the people
New potrait mode dejavu from my Microsoft Lumia but in another level
Even though there are no shocking changes besides introducing USBC which each product from other tech and mobile manufacturers are already using the YouTube tech reviewers on this planet will have thousands of hours of content to produce about essentiallynothing spectacular 
"YAY You got your favorite phone
That has features android lovers BEEN hadl"
Such an underwhelming showcase this year Lets hope for an iPhone Ultra next year and a smaller Ultra watch
Whats the battery life 
"I hate apples products because the whole companys schtick is to sell a turd however this iph 

wait a sec theres no fast charging"
"Its crazy having a flag ship phone with a 60Hz display in 2023 Apple should have at least made it 90Hz display

You didnt mention how the new iPhone 15 only has a 60Hz display"
Im one of those weird Apple lovers who buys the phone outright and then I hold onto it for however many years  so Im ready to upgrade from my iPhone 11 Pro to the 15 Pro Max just because I want a bigger screen I also feel this investment will be worth it for me personally because I am a Social Media Manager who creates content not only for work but also for my own enjoyment so Im excited for the camera upgrade Im excited for his future reviews of the Pro  Pro Max
I wish they make different designs we been use the same designs since the 11 pro and 12 pro
Yeah NGL their implementation of USBC was a slap in the face Really cant think of a reason why they couldnt give us the true functionality charging speeddata transfer for the base models and thunderbolt for Pros when the iPads and all the other android phones already have it Apple doing their thing with artificial hardwaresoftware limitations 
Im just here to shout you out for them quoting you during their keynote Thats flipping huge But you know that all ready  Congratulations 
I guess Ill stay with Iphone XS Max Next Iphone will be the the one ill upgrade to
Subtitles english default still does not available
"From some time now last few years the new phones are a joke when it comes to new featuresdesignupgrades for some brands Apple being the 1st but not the only one 
It is just embarrassing  to launch a new phone and the upgrades are 
 New colour
 Satin back instead of glossy
 USB port 20 in 2023 Should have happened 8 years ago
 Slightly better chipcameradisplay which is welcomed
 No fast charging considering the new port
 Titanium instead of steel How does that helps when you break the screen
 still 60hz on base model

And whats a bummer is that even the upgrades are not to many only on the Pro version youll have all of them And non of the iphones are cheap"
Small note on iPhone 15 Pro Since it is lighter it will carry less energy when droppen and possibly this could leave to less shatterede glass 
Stop peomoting that crap New action button that is such an innovation
Iphone 15 whats new Simple USB type C
same shit every year 
very hard to find new thing in i phone is always an old thing apple never fail to disappoint
Not getting it No actual upgrade from 14 pro
Create a problem and then solve it the apple way of innovation
It blows my mind how isheep get so excited when Apple adds a function that Android specifically Samsung has had for years
My friend are you lefthanded
Are apple still selling 800900 phones with 60MHz refresh rates
AHAHAHA WELCOME TO ANDROID CHARGER LAND
This is the first time i saw MKBHD coming to an event just wanting to coming for attendance I can see why when you have so many super cheap phone with more advanced technology than this current iPhone Nothing can make you impressed anymore IPhone is a good phone but yah Its stuck with those terms Just good Nothing more
imagine if Samasung lauched a phone without any good features and relauching the same design MKBHD would criticize them so badly but when apple does it then it is all cool
The thing Apple has to save some of their things for incoming years but all I think the they did a good job
12 or 15 are not focal lengths on the iPhone or any phone that I know Its just a crop Doesnt change optically it doesnt really zoom in
Yeah still nothing new They have more and more catching up to do
Apple is once late to the game compared to Android Meanwhile iPhone users laugh at Android users like were missing out on being late
Id keep my current iPhone but between it being a few years old cracked on the front and back and the new one getting USB C I figure its worth upgrading over just getting the glass replaced If my phone werent damaged Id hold off at least another year
Im coming from a Xs so to be honest everything on these are an improvement for me Ill probably go with the pro and not the pro max as much as I really want the 5x zoom but I just dont like the feel of a larger size phones Ive owned two plus sized iPhones in the past and always revert back to the regular size
"On the regular 15 it USB 2
USB 2 should not be called USB C"
Its the same shit for more Strong pass
DIdnt they say the Pro Max could shoot 3d video or spatial video whatever to be viewed on Vision Pro  I thought that was sorta coool
from the little that I have seen the iPhone 15 doesnt look to be more than a port change The Pro and Max get a customizable button with the Max only getting a new lens really not too much exciting to be honest and USB C isnt any faster or different its still the 20w charging that the lighting conterpart had Theres no reverse wireless charging and thats a bummer now to see if any cool USB C accessories come out for the new phone that are worth it honestly there really isnt anything there other than USB C that warrants me to want to switch from my 12 pro Max  faster yes but really what can the 15 pro max do that the 12 pro max cant other than the 48mp and the new lense and a faster processor   We cant forget about the dynamic island that apple added last year and no one really cares about Let alone knows that its a feature of the phones now the little that do know they want it USB C feel like apple was forced in to adding USB C and it feel like it was only because some countries wont let them have phones in there country unless its USB C Will i be getting USB C iPhone most likely not but only time will tell and once I see it we will see what happens maybe it be nice to have USB C in an IPhone but my 12 pro max works just fine
No product red this year
why im receiveing so much ad from samsung
The  in tech reviews  keep giving that unbiased reviews dont let them persuading you 
Seemed a rather uninspiring release really thought there would be a big step this year That said usb c is good I wouldnt go back to apple without that The new chip seems really powerful based on stats but I dont game so less impact for myself
The action button is just a software update  Theres no reason why the current switch cant be customizable
Im not buying a new iPhone till they include a built in infrared camera
Who is that cameraman 1109
The biggest lie is the pricing Those prices are before tax And around the world the pro max will go for 1450 EURO or more
as usual never been impressedIm more excited on how Samsung will make fun on the new iphones when they come out 
Another copy paste iphone sadly
People really have just forgiven Anker for their shenanigans huh
Their slogan should be iPhone 15 surprisingly more Android  
"The Base models 15 and 15 Plus should get atleast 90hz display USB 3 speed and 30 watt Charging
And the Pros Thunderbold Port and  50 watt fast charging"
Do i see you guys shooting the brand new GfX 100 ii which was also revealed yesterday  1105
I am quite disappointed about Apple not really utilizing USB C advantages on the base models They really did the bare minimum because the EU forced them to switch I was really hoping for fast charging capabilities and Thunderbolt on both pro and base models Or at least give the Pro model Thunderbolt
"According to Maques the best thing of the iPhone 15 was the USBC 118  well  mainly for the Pro version because for the cheap version its 20 a shame
Ironically  the best thing was because the European Union forced Apple Pathetic"
I usually buy a new iPhone every 2 to 3 years just because it seems like a waste of money since there is just no need still works and looks good This year I will not upgrade to a new iPhone regardless of how old my  phone is As an iPhone user for years I was always defending them constantly People were saying they cost too much offer nothing look the same bla bla bla Now I am starting to see the same thing I just feel like I am wasting my money for a slightly better camera and an USBC that in this case doesnt even have fast charge which any other company offers for ages Phone that looks like any other iPhone 23 generations back I dont know it is just marketing and nothing else really Sorry Apple but you are waaaaaaay to expensive for what you offer
Is the weight significantly low
What happened to that intro few seconds 
"The USBC forced by EU  
Waiting for replaceable battery in next 5 years"
Looks like apple is finally catching up to Samsung  in all seriousness  so the new iPhone is just the old 14 pro max besides the C port So the only new real one would be the 15 pro max correct
Does anyone really get excited over the New iPhone  Apple is just making the same phone with little tweaks  The phone has been pretty much the same as the 11  is it really any wonder that iPhone sales are down  Where are the foldables  Where is a 7 screen  I have an idea how about take a break and come out with a new iPhone in 2026 or 2027
Before watching this uhm thinking  how has Marquez managed to make this video more than 8mins because this years IPhone updates a so mediocre
Where is ringvibrate toggle
"Ok Mr Brownlee you need to pair up with Chealsy and Tony the Youtubers whose focus is on 35mm cameras as the 48 megapixels in the new Apple 15iPhone surpasses the megapixels in the new mirrorless cameras 

I believe with a proper sturdy stand for the phone it will take better photos for less while the 35mm mirrorless cameras can track moving objects better being the only dominant attribute"
"Not sure why people get excited over glass and tactile updates when the phone gets covered with screen protectors and cases 

Seems its getting closer to an Android but even still leagues behind The largest updates as far as features presented go are software based Even the camera updates Software tweaks"
Special thanks to EUs new legislation for this gift of usb c
Thats a bummer 15 pro get the goodies but 15 plus  max doesnt its mind boggling  like how you do that too ppl  you wanna charge more just for only changing the camera n battery the shape  come on Apple this makes me wanna just keep my 13 pro max Only issue I have is my charge port weak  Which I have wireless charging so it doesnt bother me
USB C is the only reason for this new phone EU forcing all manufacturers to use the same plug
I thought you are going to mention about spatial video that i think a game changer for bumping up the sale of vision pro next year
If you all give me 1  Ill be able to buy iPhone 
More than the iPhone I am surprised by the 18 M visits in 5 hours
Firmly entrenched in Apple camp Long term phone MacBook air pods user But this has got to be the most underwhelming product release in a long time across the board We all expected it but kinda hoped theyd come out of the gate with something Last year had dynamic island which was still nothing game changing but something unique But I see absolutely nothing to convince me to upgrade my 13 Pro Max
Of course they wont add fast charging Thats the new feature for next years iphone 
USBC is a compliance requirement from the European Union for iPhones and almost everyother phone
Im in camp dont care at all Ill stick to my 14 pro for now
I pretty much know everything about the new iPhone since I saw the event I just like watching MKBHD videos 
USBC not a selling point for me Action button not a selling point for me Only major improvements I see is the A17 chip coming to pro models and maybe the titanium body making the phone a tiny bit lighter Gotta save some feats for next year I guess
Seems like not much to get excited about if your on the 14 pro The yearly new phone coming out seems like a bad idea would be nicer if apple put out a new one every third year instead and that way they could probably put out something that is a significant update from the previous models Even if I had infinte amount of money I would still not update a phone every year to get these tiny updates just because of the hassle to change your phone
I needed a new phone last year assumed USBC would be this year so I waited
honestly i dont really care about iphone 15 right now iam still using my iphone 11 its almost 5 years now and still fast so honestly apple have good product
The IPhone 1515 pro looks nice and great video man 
this is getting ridiculous
Im in camp will get whatever the newest iphone is when my current contract runs out USB C was one of the things that kept me on android
Really which apple would just make one phone in two sizes of this pro word for small extra stuff
Ill never believe that he hasnt had the phone in hand for weeks now
"Its unfortunate the masses are idiots who think the Pro is the best version as if they really need the features When in fact the MINI is the best one overall Just because most didnt buy it because they thought its a budget shitty phone they dont make m anymore 

Im sticking to the mini as long as i can If they never introduce a mini or SE in mini form ever again and stop the iOS updates in the LONG run im moving to ANDROID "
Wow an actuon button  and usb c
I got a hold of the new iPhone 15 As if they didnt bring you into a bespoke viewing areaon a litterwith bottles of expensive champagne at the readyand had someone move your fingers on the device as you directed them 
The usbc has me interested Its about time
Im not surprised there was no fast charging what else would they release in 16 pro then
The words all Iphone users use daily are u got a iphone charger
"I am in camp dont care at all Ive been back and forth constantly 

iPhone 5S
Galaxy S6 Edge Plus
Galaxy S8
iPhone XS Max 
iPhone 12 Pro Max
Galaxy Z Fold 4

Z Fold is everything I want in a phone 

Action Button  I can map my lock button double press to literally anything I use it as my flashlight 

USBC  Already have USB 31 I have a 1 TB Z fold and regularly use it as a portable hard drive at work 

Camera  The iPhone camera is much better than my camera but I dont really take a lot of photos 

Google also addressed the iMessage problem somewhat I cant switch back to Apple until they join the foldable world I am happy that my wife will finally share a charger with me Thats nice"
Look like the iPhone 14
"Apple while launching iphone 69
We have increased the width of the phone by 1mm

Pro models have been made with lemon yellow colour
Its starting price is 7999
Pro starting price is 10999

People lets buy it"
iPhone 14 Pro Max here There is zero reason to upgrade a totally underwhelming event New charging port stop the press
"Very nice video and analisis the new iPhone 15 series 
But I am so disapointed kindly sayed for a few reasons 
Colours are meh meh for my humble opinion blue especialy no telescopic camera on iPhone 15 Pro Max NO iPhone Ultra but that I am expected so must wait next year iPhone 16 Ultra fingers cros cases are something must wait to seen what it is that 
Also Apple Watch Ultra 2 NO other colours NO bigger display NO new way connect bands  and so on 

Must believe and BIG hope that next year come a realy NEW things with Apple and gadgets"
Tip just watch at 2x speed
Maybe their charging temperatures will be improved but I guess that until the technology really changes theres not a whole lot they can do when pounding it down with 20 watts
I cant understand how people can get tricked into sooooo much bullshit which apple sells for 999 
The whole usb 2 and 3 deal plus the notch plus no fast charging i wont be buying one
Fun fact That lateaddition of blur to portrait photos was available in default camera of POCO F1 since 2018 Possibly other Xiaomi phonesflagships too before that
Wheres the SE 
clown world 15
Only fools get excited for nothing
RIP MagSafe Duo
Since they added a A17 Pro Chip Judging by their naming scheme there is a A17 MaxUltra Chip on the Horizon Just makes sense just look at the macs
All i have to say is plateau people update after 2 or 3 years then you will see a nice upgrade
I dont love the new portrait mode style on the iPhone like the on Galaxy S23 Ultra
It is sad that there is absolutely no innovation anymore Apple catches up a little bit but not much
Cant beat the new Hawaii
Usb 3 is pro  pos
Camp totally getting a new iPhone 15 Pro Max
I hope I still enjoy my 14 pro 
A new iPhone is always a hype regardless of anything that they newly put on the phone while weve already been familiar with the feature for years
Another year of 0 innovation
Wouldnt many prefer instead of the camera main lenses upgrade we get an actual 120hz refresh rate on the base model plus some faster charging I mean camera upgrade is nice but the zoom still isnt there on base models
Most of it sounds like what youd expect but Apple positions themselves as the future and magical etc USB 20 has been with us for twenty three years  Base model or not seeing USB 20 in anything new in 2023 is absurd  Why not use a PowerPC G3 too  Yeah Im being snarky but USB 20 is a joke for ANYTHING modern never mind something as highend as the new iPhone  Why not use 80211b while youre at it
Whats the refresh rate of iphone 15 is it still 60hz
I do believe these are the best phones but I also find that sad I wish someone else would catch up and force Apple to innovate again instead of releasing the same phone 10 years in a row
First phone with usb C no thanks will wait until iphone 17 then Ill upgrade
"Still an iPhone
Negative infinity  0 divided by pi"
Wish apple and Android would just come together like Aerosmith
This guy is just an android user being forced to use iPhones Why exactly is there an obligation on apple to explain their moves to the user Im sure there are technical reasons for the limitations but that must be beyond the scope of these videos
The 15 looks like the 14 looks like the 13 Apple really boring yet again
SO underwhelming again
Wtf bruh if the new updates are this subtle they better not launch it 
give me a citra ios version and something like the s pen for android and maybe ill THINK about swapping
Everyone noticed what will be known as The Quote in the history of your channel Why not Close to 175 million subscribers is a big number that even the likes of Apple has to notice As for Apple another nice round of products nothing revolutionary but a little more refined It is time for Apple to jump into the fold flip mix unless they have something else new to offer under 350000  The environmental push was good to see but it is unclear what the effect of Apple and Apple customers on the environment really amounts to
Marques youre an inspiration my friend Great review as usual
"okay so now iPhone users cannot ask IS SOMEONE HAVING AN IPHONE CHARGER  
the flex wont work hereafter people"
Im still getting the new iphone because Im pretty sure they fixed the heating problem 14 pro max have with battery degradation
I feel like the base iPhone 15 colours are very girly other than black Not pleased about that
"Where is all this bandwagon hate coming from  all I see is people bashing apple for being expensive  people who dont even own a apple product  then go on to say they arent innovative whenSamsung is literally the same Yall ridiculed apple for removing the headphone jack but when Samsung did it  No issue They drag apple for making similar looking phones at launch  But no comment on Samsungs basic copy and paste design for the past couple of generations Yall dragged apple for no brick in the box BUT AGAIN Samsung does it yall dont even bat an EYE talk about the price of the flagship model and completely disregard the rest of the lineup meanwhile Samsungs flagship is the SAME PRICE

Yall calling us sheep meanwhile yall bandwagon together like a horde of rats every time apple drops a product 
BFFR"
Now iPhone users can use all the Android accessories
Whats the point of a new phone every year they should do it every 18 months or 2 years
Nothing new the same old IPHONE
Nothing new will stick to my 13pro
The way to look at an iPhone is if youve bought one in the past 23 years nothing they do in the new ones will blow you away I have a 14 pro max and theres not a single feature the 15s have that interest me at all
I have a Xiaomi Pcoo F5   Its a fraction of the cost and outstanding  Why peope waste so much money on Apple 
I have a S23 Ultra I like both Apple and Samsung They both have their pros and cons Think I might just get the 15 pro model Try it out for a little bit and then return it and go back to Samsung
Get a 14 pro max most carries have a great deal on them or get the regular 15 max Thanks bra for the great video
"hi Mks how do you think the phonehuawei Mate60 pro  could you post a video introduce and tell us how you feel after using
thanks "
Omg new button and 5x zoom Seems innovation died with Steve Job
I still love lightning elegance and simple The last is limited plug cable And now looks like android poor Europe is bad rules ever 
This is pretty cool can we have Touch ID in the power button like iPad does tho I miss Touch ID
I was surprised they brought the dynamic island to the base models within the next generation I thought they wouldve kept that a pro feature for a few years at least
My camera still has miniusb So even in 2023 people have devices with 3 types of usb mini micro c
just get 14 pro max for better price
USBC is the best thing apple did since the first iphone
They only added USBC because the EU forced them too
They are switching production to India with high defective rate of iphones I wonder how good the quality control will be for the phones that going out to public main reason why I dont want to upgrade to iphone 15
Im not saying everything should have 100W charging like my onepluss 11 cause as much as I love it its also clearly excessive However surely they can do better than 20W
i wanna try an iphone for fun even tho it will be a downgrade for me currently have a note 10 with 0 issues
USB C is something that Im looking forward on the Pro models since it comes with external recording and capture in Log
Skip this year
The big question is though will we see that this accessory is not supported error message after using a 3rd party cable for a while Or does Apple force us to purchase their overpriced cables
usb 20 in almost 2024 are you sure this company should exist
Your favorite thing about the phone is the action button on the side  Thats like saying your favorite thing at Thanksgiving is the steamed carrots  I was ready to switch back but Ill just stay with Samsung  What a bummer
A few years later Apple would release a lightning cable as a lightning innovation
Wondering if the natural titanium colour option has the same PVD coating as the other 3 colour options or just bare titanium Anyone know yet
Man i realy considering iphone now since it can literally play aaa game
"Thank you for the video Two questions

If that multifunctional button is set as mute switch is there any permanent indication on the display that the phone IS on mute Previous mechanical toggle had red mark when the phone was on mute How can we tell now

Is there any limitation with 4K video recording on the 128GB vs 256GB pro models
Like you cannot get 4K ProRes internally because of limited storage I cant find it anywhere in the specs 

Thnx"
Surprised This Video Is Longer Than 5 Minutes
Hmm Im whatever I dont need a new phone
New features are good but no major changes in my opinion that would make me want to change my 13 pro
So literally nothing changed I mean the EU forced them to change it Thats why they did it 2nd action button not that useful 3rd just an improved camera There was nothing major Faster chip But nothing that much
I think Ill stick with the greatest iPhone ever mademy 13 mini
"Engineer here about the Titanium being stronger Its not

I mentioned this elsewhere but to highlight this point Since I get a lot of people have in their heads that titanium is a strong material

Titanium is often thought of as super strong and premium The reason for that is that is strength to weight ratio is better then steel Just like aluminium is That means that the same structural strength can be achieved in a lower weight part The volume however is not necessarily the same Think of aluminium everyone knows its lighter but easier to damage Titanium works the same way Its stronger then aluminium but both easier to scratch as well as easier to break then steel 

Its only advantage is weight It definitely helped them make the phone lighter But imo Id rather have a few grams heavier and have a steel construction Unfortunately Im sure Apple knows most people think titanium is stronger then steel"
So basically a nothingburger I guess i cant be mad since its the same price
Innovation in iPhones has hit a dead end
Their new trailer is really really beautiful One of the best so far
Watching this iPhone 8 
Price bump for 15pro max made sense if you wanna shoot in pro res than you had to get 256 any way for the same price  But you know that already  I upgrade every year regardless so that wasnt shocking  Apple showed you love 
Omg finally someone describing the actual colours so the natural titanium is closer to starlight I was so stuck between the natural titanium and white titanium as Im a sucker for starlight and was bummed they didnt release starlight for the pro models I was worried the natural titanium might look like a very cool toned grey
"Id assume that theyre just adapting to the new standard they just shoved a USB C port on the iphone with little edits 
I hope by the iPhone 16 they have USB 3 across the board but honestly pro users can get the pro and the rest can get the normal ones unless they want the big model"
Why is nobody talking about the fact that the base iphone 15 models only have a 60hz display For a phone that costs 800 thats robbery at this point
23RD IPHONE IM A LITTLE CONFUSED THERE MARQUES
"again zero innovation from apple
so dissappointing"
You know Apple fans cleary dont know what to talk about anymore when their all talking about its new Iphones charger port 
Apple is a company who knows how with less effort earn good money  The problem is in the costumers they are to easy to get
Props to MKHD A billionaire literally mentions you by name on his once a year show and you didnt even mention it in your next video
"Well i am interested to buy this iPhone 15pro max but i live in India so iphone 14 pro maxs starting price is aprox 2290 USD 
Yes they are expensive Wish someone could giveaway iphone 15 pro Max "
735 im pretty sure titanium has better compressive and impact strength too that could help if u drop it on its corner too hard
most boring ahh iPhone update ever
This is really disappointing from Apple and they keep getting away with a lack of innovation because their customers keep buying the new iphone regardless of what if anything has been upgraded
Is there any reason to choose a different storage size considering how well iCloud works are there any speed bumps with 512gig or greater like we saw with the MacBooks recently
Apple got 3 interns in the back making all the changes
The charging speed has decreased dramatically on the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max vs the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max according to Apples spec sheets in the store
Still usb 20
I think this years iPhone upgrades are very similar to what Galaxy S did this year  upgrades that dont look like upgrades but are aimed to improve QoL aspects of using their phones
did they fix the issue with the displays tho That wouldve been something to welcome
"most expensive usbc ever

guys we use round wheels now like everybody else and only bc eu told us to"
Im still using an iPhone 8 battery 72 I hope the 15 pro lasts 5years 
The most disappointing iPhone ever
Im not at all surprised they got rid of the 1100 model of the pro max because making people pay 100 more for double the storage is insane profit margin for them
They added usbc after its been used for ages
Their usb tech is over 20 yrs old apple isnt innovative just copy and paste these events are a waste of time
Europe want that apple have usbc  also changeable battery we still waiting
So basically Marques nailed most of the predictions he made lol specially the top speed usb C only for pro version
I have a 13 pro max and it has a settings like the action button but your using the back of the phone like tap twice for flash triple tap for camera etc however you want it to its the same just a button not back tapping
Apple should give you some shares as you are their best salesman
feels like 15 is 14 pro without pro motion and 1 less camera
I guess Apple have many other things available but they just dont want to release it too fast
"The main camera on the 15 Pro is NOT bigger
Apple just used very smart wording here The 15 Plus does not use the same sensor as the 14 Pro Its smaller Instead of 122m theyre only 10 And Apple said that the 15 Pro uses an even bigger sensor than 15 and 15 Plus NOT bigger than the 14 Pro Its the exact sam camera as the 14 Pro f178 122m IBIS20 etc"
Wondering if my existing MagSafe charger would work in the new phone still
I feel like I just watched last year video about the iPhone but the number just changed  Iphones are  really boring
"Your quote being read out by the CEO 
Literally felt proud of you Marques  
Obviously coming to the video I felt all these updates are just barely anything when compared to the previous generation
But for those at the 8 series would probably consider upgrading to the 15 just cause of the massive differences"
iPhone 15 is a waste of money
Im FINALLY upgrading from an iPhone 7 Plus ready for the 15  
For people that upgrade their phone every year this is whatever But Ive been rolling with a 12 pro just waiting for USBC to upgrade and now its here and Im stoked Going from the 12pro to the 15promax is going to feel like a big jump
Should I upgrade from the 13 pro or nah
No red iPhone 
I wanna see the size comparison of 15 pro and pro Max
Will there be a USB typeC iPhone 14
no idea how apple still exists the amount of sheep in this world is just sad
Im not on the same page with this guy opinion about the action button  for me it does absolutely nothing is worthless and even stupid to replicate the original one Those innovations were already way better implemented by the jailbreak community by simply modifying the hard or now long press function on the shortcut buttons on the Lock Screen But you already knew that
Too bad the 5x is just for the max 
Never knew 1gm less is noticeable lighter
Androids and iPhones finally having the same charger 
I was really hoping for something worth upgrading from my 12 pro but still there is not
Thank you EU The US govt would never have done this Theyre owned by these unscrupulous companies like Apple
do u need a usb c cable with mfi or can u use a normal usb c cable 
Will the Pro phones have video out via USB C
Hot take I dont think there was ever a feature on Apple that I couldnt care less about than the introduction of USBC 
"Titanium back n USB C is the Headline  Dude wheres the Innovayion from Apple in a world full of hair line thin FOLDING PHONES 
APPLE COSTLY MARKETING"
What about the ram
Im waiting till next year when I go to college to upgrade my phone will probably wait for the  iPhone 16 because of that
"Its funny that the Standart 15 has usb 2 
Years ago all people were laughing because Xiaomi and some other manufacturers still used usb 2 and now apple uses usb 2 in the newest phone "
I wish I knew how much Anker paid so advertise on this video Dude is probably set for a year on this video alone
Marq This is some next level BULLSHIT lol
now people with old iphones will be out casted and mocked by new 15 models just by saying you guys still using lightning ports lmao  even last years iphones are outdated by just one type c port update
more sheep climbing over each other when the only real change is the number from 14 to 15clowns and money always easily parted
I like the subtle touch on the cushions 
marques you forgot the Thread radio in the pro models which allows for mesh like IOT solutions
"All this is absolutely 
AMAZING 
INCREDIBLE 
ASTOUNDING
ASTONISHING
PHENOMENAL
UNBELIEVABLE
REMARKABLE
EXTRAORDINARY
SPECTACULAR"
Hmmmmm nah I think Ill pass on this upgrade
Im in Camp maybe Ill get it when my service provider is offering these with a 1000 down for an upgrade
It is annoying that everyone keeps saying that titanium is stronger than stainless steel It really isnt
Im sticking with my old iPhone 11 Pro Max and my Huawei Mate XS 2 Ill only buy a new iPhone again if Apple makes one with USB C that supports thunderbolt video out and desktop mode
Apple keeps robbing people
I cant explain how happy I am that Pro models are finally not stainless steel Personally I hated it from the beginning fingerprints magnet caseless phone always looked filthy from all the oils it collected on stainless steel Thats main reason I started using case Finally gonna upgrade from XS Max this year and I just cant wait especially that Im a sucker for titanium
No fast charging again damn Ive got a OnePlus 9 pro currently and 65w charging still amazes me to this day I was really hoping this USBC switch would include fast charging but damn guess ima have to wait another year and hope they decide to add it lol
Im getting the Natural Titanium its going to be my first ever iPhone So excited
"I think next year USBC coming to nonPro iPhones 
And Pro iPhones getting Thunder bolt upgrade"
its a fuckin phone so what Not spending more than 300 for any phone Apple already died years ago Its consumption without any thought
"apple hasnt tried in 10 years lol this isnt as bad as iphone 13 and 14 but still shit still 2 PLUS years behind other phones and ppl just foam at the mouth
for it

trash complany"
Welcome to the club apple sorry you were made to do this and didnt just do it yourself to help your customers out
Dude youre the most popular tech youtuber You affect a lot of peoples decisions so please research a bit more and get your facts straight The camera hardware between the 14 Pro and the 15 Pro is exactly the same No new larger 48mp main sensor or improved ultrawide
Im in camp dont care but I like the channel so I watched anyway 
Congrats on the quote Marques You truly deserve it for all the clients you help them gather Keep up the great work I hope more companies admit and acknowledge all you are doing for them Peace
mkbhd well you can change focal length just by tapping in the camera app at the 1x several times to change the focal length you dont have to go into camera settings to change that 1040
I can now use a Xiaomis charger to charge the iPhone 15 Heck Yeah
Been a iPhone user since 2011 and have had almost all the major flagship models since In my opinion this was the must underwhelming iPhone announcement in recent memory I currently have a iPhone 14 Pro Max and very happy I did not wait for this phone coming from the 13 Pro max Thanks for all the great work and congratulations on getting mentioned by Apple at the keynote
I think the 5x camera might be worth the upgrade alone 
They gotta come up with some new names for Iphones soon Aint no way there will be an Iphone 72 some day XD
Would anyone know where I can find the background image from the thumbnail Id love to use it 
Absolutely outrageous it still doesnt have fast charging My pixel 3xl has it 
its the same shit bro
How do you put your phone to mute if you use the action button for something else
They brushed over USB C quick  I was hoping the pros didnt have it all and they Introduce some new fast charging MagSafe option with no ports but maybe in a later model
Just looks like 14 
Apple purposely gimped USB C so they can just drag out incremental upgrades to it over the next few years
jerryrigseverything
Lets go
"I am on team android but I always loved iPhones especially right when they come out I remember how excited everyone was for a new iPhone launch and now its just nothing Feel like the iPhone hype is fading away
Understand that phones are getting boring in general but iPhone has always been boring compared to the competition and still had a lot of hype and excitement Now its fading"
These updates are laughable American tech evolves from suppression of Asian tech development innovation and competition where the consumer should benefit  Instead you  get this  a joke Never the same since the update scandal that ruined batteries
Samsung galaxy s23 ultra is much better
getting a samsung advertisement at the beginning
Do Fairphone 5 plsssss
I got an advertisement for Sumsung in an iPhone video 
I am totally interested in replacing my 11 with the 15 Plus
"HAHAHA 
THE SAME OLD PHONE  TYPE C 
samsung is the KING "
Lifelong Android User Protip dont buy iPhones but Apple Stocks 
"OMG When Flip came out my man literally said They settled whereas the changes on it were phenomenal bigger screen more features etc 

iPhone changed its lightning port to Type C and Marquest lost his mind I never knew he was biased"
Kind of a bummer that Apple still doesnt improve on features and software wise like the Google phones for example And also 60 hz screen for that price I have given up on iPhone this year when I saw what a Google and Samsung phone can do Its crazy when I think about iPhones I feel like I have scammed and I used an iPhone for a very long time since the 4S and I had 6 models since they announce features that android phones had for yeaaars are u kidding me I remember when the 5 6 7 8 X 11 came out and they made some major changes it was dope back then Since the 12 came out I have this feeling that they want to go for the money for the lowest costs possible I am not buying it Might try a Pixel phone NICE VIDEOS MARQUES U R AMAZING THO
Underwhelming to say the least USBC I have MagSafe camera Im not a photographer and the new customizable button is too far up if youre a righty
Does the functionality of the action button change with focus mode
Man oh man  same stuff ever year just with a twist  And the problem is people fall for it and spend their money on it  same
If my sister now wants to sell her Iphone 15 anytime I will not be able to buy it pink color
The only reason most people will upgrade to any other new phone is usually some issue like a end of cycle operating software update or the device is badly needing a replacement Im now four generations behind but the phone still works fine Im actually amazed that the iPhone  I have has made it through all the abuses I given it
I saw that quote on the event what a shill
"they added the USBC this year as something new for Apple to sell 
next year they can sell the USBC with NEW FAST CHARGING"
The OnePlus 2 had a USB c port with USB 20 speeds back in 2013
Anyone else not really care a whole lot about usb c I mean its cool I guess but I only charge my phone wirelessly and I never transfer data from my phone
i didnt watch any review but yours
i will wait iphone 17
"I think the pro versions are forwarded towards pro users like pro gamers or pro photographers 
But honestly the only think that impressed me is that they moved the gaming challenge to next level"
"We will need UsB C adapters to use our speakers that still use the lightning connection 

What can we hope for in the iPhone Pro 16 

Im waiting for the iPhone 16 or 17 pro models"
Marques to be honest with you Ill keep it my 13 Pro Max still going strong with 100 battery health after 14 months
Lmfao every same tech review the new iPhone  it games changer
Im not gonna lie I dont understand anyone buying Iphone over Samsungs since like the Iphone 7 I used to have only Apple phone products and ive been wanting to try them again but they just are not great
I want a bigger phone really i have a 12 but im not sure if its worth it yet and i feel like the regular iphones arent worth it anymore lacking too many feature the pros have
"Substantial upgrade for me upgrading from an iPhone XS Max 5 generations worth of improvements
Although i will wait an extra month for the October 4 Pixel 8 Pro event and see what they offer with it then decide which one to grab"
Its just a 14 with usbc Just as was predicted
I dont know guys but these few new things being added now seem like excuses for being late to this smartphone world  I mean whats the point  people just buy them because they are the cool kids on the block
And  not mentioned  we may stream by cable the video we are recording in real time into an external drive Thats primo
Samsung has wireless charging to charge headphones and the watch and now Apple does it with the cable it is well behind
"Gotta say this seems identical 
Reckon Apple is out of ideas"
The most expensive usbc released as brand new feature since everything else is basicaly still the same in this phone lol
"Tbh the iPhone 15 was a bigger upgrade than the 15 Pro
Dynamic island USBC 48MP and basically a totally new design yes it is
The Pro only also got USBC and Titanium Thats almost it"
"Glad I got the 14 pro max 1 month ago I looked at the leaks and saw no switch and I decided to get the last one also they dont have my colour anymore in the new lineup so double happy at that And idc about the cable whats important is the brick and the last year cable works with any USBC brick 

Also 1st time trying an iPhone  had android all my life before this one What I realised is that for general use for normal people all phones are the exact same and the requirements are basic but with iPhone it just feels nicer using it a phone call is still a phone call browsing the Internet still browsing the Internet watching YouTube is the same thing planning notes reminders alarms 99 of normal peoples activity is doable on both systems but Apple has little twinks little stars around the edges wich just make it more enjoyable to use"
Dont understand why Apple always just goes the half way If the action button is customizable why not let use double and triple press Could perfectly keep the hold to silent and have double turn on flashlight etc
No fast charging for a 1500 Phone  thats just lunatic
740 what hes trying to say is  glass is glass and glass breaks
Is it safe to say that the Titanium Blue looks like the 12 Pros blue if yes thats a go for me
Pro or pro max
Marques it is such a disgrace for you to even review or talk about apple products Innovation is Huawei New Chips on their own
the titanium strong enough that we dont need a case
Dont buy a new phone unless its more than eight years old
Nice its time to get my opinions reshaped
Mein Gareeb hun
It looks the exact same What new design 
"1 major disappointment I had watching the event I got to say was that it seems like youll be having to pay for emergency tools At least they said it was free for 2 years implying after its gonna cost money Ofc I get not everyone needs these tools but it would be horrible if someone dies with an iPhone on them capable of the emergency features but wasnt able to use them due to not having payed for them I hope its possible to use those features anyway if really needed A much better alternative if they really need to ask money is to do so then after it saved you

Otherwise standard iPhone
Seems decent Im honestly surprised they didnt raise the prices on them I figured they might this year and not update much more since the USBc might help people justify it anyway Then next year they could add more stuff and claim they didnt even increase prices since they would have done it this year But they actually kept them the same That makes the few features they did add pretty good imo Especially the higher peak brightness 2000 nits is crazy high And if they are making the dynamic island a thing its good they have it on both classes now

I dont like the aluminium imo that gets damaged to easily Id much prefer to see steel being used High quality steel would still be cheaper then aluminium I believe The only real downside that its heavier But honestly couldnt care less about phone being a few grams heavier in exchange for a steel build Would have also preferred 3x zoom to 2x but not a huge deal 

What is a big deal to me though is the USB 2 speed That seems petty almost I cant imagine it really was that expensive to add Even if the chips they use since they are last years arent capable of it But even then they knew they would have to switch back then too They could have kept it into account The only reason its USB2 is because they want it as a feature for the pro I was really hoping the normal one would be usb 3 at least I dont think the average person will have much trouble with 2 But its unnecessary and just embarrassing that such old versions end up on the iPhone Imagine if they still had Bluetooth 2 or something It just doesnt make sense

Pro phones
Added a lot more then I thought they would The action button makes a lot of sense and is in line with the Apple Watch pros button Im glad they added something like this Even if its not new and simple Apple opening up to more customisation is always good imo Its another step to them allowing you more power over your own stuff And I expect if it works out it will make its way into the normal phones eventually

The camera lenses on the pro max are honestly crazy I think you could show some of the most optimistic phone designers 10 years ago and they wouldnt ever believe this would be a thing by now I cant imagine how much work went into designing the lenses There is plenty you can criticise about Apple but I think they now objectively have the best phone lenses by far Im very surprised they didnt raise the prices due to them In a way they did by removing the lowest storage model But that was probably the most reasonable way they could have done that If youd upgrade the storage on any phone it would be that one

Im also disappointed with the material of the pro though I currently have an iPhone 12 with steel build and they make the 15 from titanium I get that most people might hear that and think its better Its not Steel is much stronger then you think Titanium is know for its strength because its so light as well steel is actually stronger as well as harder So much harder to damage I wish they would use that instead I again do not care if it will be a little heavier

And lastly the connector At least this one has usb 3 and can actually transfer stuff at a reasonable speed But still I hoped 3 would have been on the normal phones I wasnt necessarily expecting it but it would have been nice if the pro was usb 4 or thunderbolt Im sure it would have been possible for them"
Which one you think is better the ultra or the pros
Just buy a pc for that price
Why are always making the base iphone shitty if the new base iphone is shit and the new phone is actually the pro version just make that one dont even produce the base version because its just like the pro of last year
Is the iPhone 15 better than the iPhone 6 
The thing that interested me the most was the promise that youll be able to record  SPATIAL VIDEO  with the iPhone 15 Pro with a SOON TO COME  software update I didnt get if it was for the Max exclusively  But the question is will the engineers at Apple be able to pull this off given the proximity between the two lenses that supposedly will be used to achieve this Will they keep the promise or will they let it slide into oblivion I think this possible headspace for a way of recording our family videos that I believe will become a standard  is a major reason to upgrade Peace
"Id like to highlight that the USB standard used in the iPhone 15 USB 20 is 22 years old Putting 22 year old technology in a 969 EUR device in 2023 is ridiculous Even the 10gbit standard is from 2013 and surpassed by 20gbit2017 40gbit 2019 and 80gbit 2022
For those wondering why this is relevant backups over cable Were talking 35 minutes versus less than 2 minutes transfer time for 128 GB"
Youre great Marques but the iPhone is getting anticlimactic
"Can somebody tell me if the new models are worth upgrading I have had the X for 5 years but its time to upgrade I was thinking to go for the 14 pro for the Camera and the 120 Hz and so on
Or is the 13 pro holding up good as well"
absolutetly surreal indead the main feature of the new iphone is an outdated charging port that was released already in the year 2000 unbelievable they get away with it
Look like decent phones obviously but Im keeping my iPhone 13 mini at this point  It wouldve been nice to see an upgrade on the refresh rate on the regular iPhone 15 and yeah the USBC is nice that apple finally joined the modern world in that area Im thinking maybe to upgrade in a year or two probably because the iPhone 13 has four gigs of RAM and that might make a difference in a couple years but right now I think it still takes great pictures and for me the battery uses fine am you know if you wanna feel like its an upgrade you gotta wait 34 years before you buy a new iPhone
"Wow how underwhelming was that Im using an iPhone 12 mini and was curious if the 15 has sth new to offer but not really It just feels as if theyre bringing out a new phone every year because thats what they do Honestly it feels a bit like a scam that only the pro has all the very new features 
Soo yep besides battery life Im still very well off with my 12mini  and the declining battery life is nothing the savebattery mode or a power bank couldnt fix 
also love the mini version because Ive just got tiny hands"
"Fk the disgusting scam of the opticalquality zoom Worst marketing lie Apple has ever pulled
You cant sell a plastic handbag call it leatherquality once and then just say its leather on your website
Its a fraud hope someone protects consumers on this one"
Ive been holding on to my X for a decent upgrade I think this years Pro is it
Stopped being impressed with the newest features of iPhone yrs ago
If the courts wouldnt have demanded them using USBC theyd never have changed it
"Im still using an iPhone 7 Plus
Wonder if this worth the upgrade yet"
Thanks EU no lightning anymore
Base model display is 60hz so it not the last year pro version
first time in 10 years i might be changing to iPhone Cant wait for the full review also samsung is also releasing the new phone in week
4 hrs 17M views dude
same shit at different varient and different price
I hate that apples making you buy the pro max just for every new feature I could get the pro but then Id be missing out on the 5x telephoto but Id be saving 200 dollars but I figured if I spend the extra Id get a bigger battery a bigger screen and this new only on pro max 5x camera feature why its like they let you buy the 128 and now let you film in ProRes 4k 30 60 with an external ssd so there not making you upgrade to the 256 for that anymore but now for the 5x you do its kinda bullsht
Was excited to see Apple quote MKBHD in their presentation this year For now Ill stick to watching the reviews of the new features
Europe would ban Apple products if Apple didnt switch over to USBC They might even make Apple get switchable batteries
"Hi Marques maybe since you are reviewing tech products for many years maybe you can explain something to me that I never really understood 
Whats this fuss about the charging speeds Why is this relevant  at all Does the regular user cannot do without the phone for more than 1 hour Or its just about this is possible so why does the iPhone does not have it Im clueless here

My view on charging is The more often you charge fast the faster the battery degrades too Does any manufacturer has found a solution to this problem I really would like to know"
Wake Up People Stop companies like Apple loot you There is no innovation whatsoever It just same product with macro changes rounded edge less bezels usb c ports Can you not see this RIP OFF
Yup ill be switching to android when my contracts up
No reverse charging in 2023 Man they are just living to be clowns
Just looks like more Ewaste to me
I know this seems bias but I feel like there is meh difference from the iPhone 14
An upgrade like this should be illegal The amount of waste that will be created just because apple and other smartphone companies feel like they need to make 5 new phone models every year to make insane profits is disgusting and disgraceful Pay 1000 for a new action button and another phone in the ocean
Will skip this series
"This is why im so glad i switched from apple to android samsung and xiaomi more precise Its a milking company that it promises the moon and in reality it gives you a rock A17 PRO Is there a non PRO chipset  Everything they do is PRO 2023 and and the storage is still 128 gb Are they even trying Iphone 15 Base model is the same Iphone 14 with some software tweaks and new colors I remember when apple announcing a new phone that wil revolutionize bla bla blai was so excited only to be sooooo disappointed in the end Now i can do whatever i want with my android phone Android gives you so much freedom Sooo yeah i was frustrated and mabe i still am but not regretting my decision Now i can have a BIG laugh when i watch apple announcing something NEW and REVOLUTIONARY Copy Tweak Paste 

PS Marquese i really enjoy your reviews"
Im in camp dont care at all 
Great We get the same old phone once again but hey relaunched and with usb c  cool what an upgrade 
No case too  pretty
me stuck with an iphone 7
no fast charging in 2023
So black is black but white is natural Alright
I put a case on every phone Ive ever bought so looks and finish dont matter
This is the first year Im considering the non pro version I used to want the latest and greatest but now now these phones are so advanced I can do everything I need and more with the regular phone
The customizable button is pretty cool  would love to see that on more phones
It says fast changing capable on the O2 site
Excellent review as usual 
Wish they had a mini
"252 just a very important point the screen has double the nits of the past model but that doesnt mean its twice as bright Perceived brightness is a logarithmic scale not a constant scale so even tho you jump from 1000 to 2000 nits its nowhere near twice as bright as apple and marques are saying its a straight up marketing lie but no one think about that
And before anyone says yeah but its still double the amount of nits even if you dont see it as 2x brighter well just think about when apple unveil a new chip imagine that the new chip had 2x more transistor that doesnt mean the chip is twice as powerful And theyll never say that its 2x more powerful theyll just say it has 2 times the amount of transistors Because the amount of transistors doesnt strictly correlate to the power of the chip Thats the same thing here for brightness and nits"
A17 is cringe  USB2 is omegalol
Cant wait till you test them thanks for the video lil bro keep up the great work
Kinda predict fast charging is sale point for iPhone 16
Is that an easter egg on the pillows
i think its still a iphone 14
"Apple reserve fast charging for iphone 16
The new portrait mode theyre bringing in now Samsung has been on it for years
Samsung has been on the side button customization for years also "
I can hear the adult Samsung fans saying Its ok youre the best no matter what anyone says  You got USBC Good for you
"Honestly 10gb seems cheap for the pros when the m1 MacBook Air had thunderbolt 3 or whatever that higher speed is

Like cant imagine it cost much to add it"
I think Apple is out of ideas
Is there a good USBC to USBA cable 
deadass might get it just for the USBC lmao
Well you said 15 is same 14 pro then why you tech guys dont go against and oppose Also when they removed chargers from box u guys never complained We consumers have not received free phones to use Hope u guys be humans
Was waiting for a new phone but nope New battery it is I guess
I lost interest in Apple as a daily phone I switched to Google devices almost 5yrs ago and as of now no desire to go back
Does the pro models still have magsafe
Guys dont be surprised USB type C has been around for a few years
Does the Iphone 15 have the 120 fps display
well still gonna use my 200 Walmart phone
how many watts will the iPhone 15 draw while charging  hopefully more than 15watts
Apple needs Jony Ive back
I think they switched to USBC this year because of upcoming regulations in the EU Other ports than USBC are not allowed anymore in Europe starting next year
"Trash phone not worth the update 
In fact changing to android will get u more new features and updates I really feel sry for apple and people who are excited to buy this  so called iPhone 15 "
Have a 12pro Max set myself up for the preorder but still unsure if Ill actually push the button on Friday My current phone still works just fine and my battery is still 87so
Nothing is new and still people fall for it Idk why
Great video as always Marques i have an iphone 11 pro max and it still works perfectly fine Do you suggest  the new iphone 15 is good enough for me to upgrade  or should i just wait until the iphone 1617 comes out
Imagine having USB C with no fast charging  typical apple
Guys sorry but its 2023so 500 USD phone with 60hzthats BIG fail
I wouldve liked the mutesilent button working also as an active button They couldve retained the silent button that flips mechanically and still be able to press the switch to perform custom actions
What did you studied on college
My reaction  
I have the iPhone 12 I think for my needs the iPhone 14 will be a good match The 15 with a pill on the screen isnt what I want and the colors suck I dont want any notch but Ill take atleast a smaller notch instead
Come on MKBHD show us something different Already watch same SHIT blah blah blah 12 hours before your video Dont just earn money publishing same video other ppl do Bring something new Some of you are top notch YouTubers
Iphone still  the slowest  charging
Well  usb c to lightning adapters will sell for sure
Not a real update for 1000 apple run EA and we love it
Fast charging is just a great way to cook your battery Anyone that understands battery composition properly would tell you to not go full nuts on charging speeds
Honestly love how theres not much of a difference between 14 ProMax and 15 ProMax They even removed the 14 Pro from the website because of how similar they are
Thanks the European Union now you can use the same cable I like apples products but they are overpriced I can justify to change my phone to the newer model every 24 years when the battery health drops down to 80
who else feels like crying when the outro music starts playing
"Marques running an iPhone 11 base model at the moment and Im pretty happy with it I tend to go with the iPhones as they go down in price and usually stay about 3 models behind

Is the new iPhone 15 worth a jump to experience a new iPhone at launch or just keep using this one for a few more years"
Its still an ecosystem thing
The usbc speed thing is such an Apple move 
That camera looks horrendous
Totally getting me a 15 Pro I cant wait Been with my trusty 11 Pro since it came out and its starting to show how old its getting 
i never got excited for iphones but that pink one is really really nice looking
Great review Always honest and straightforward  Not enough to make me upgrade from my 14 pro max I went on apple website to compare the two and they are exactly the same besides those 3 changes Ill wait and see what the 16 pro max brings next year Great review though
In a world where influencers sell themselves to the highest bidder he is one of the few that still have some integrity
Fast charging ruins your battery though
paying 1199  for same sh   Common grow up guys looks for something else
"As someone whos never used an iPhone WAKE THE FUSB UP

"
Fast charging No 120hz on base iPhone thats over 1000 cad 
Making potrait later  changing focus feature was available to Android for years 
559 But in the intro video they said you can directly record to external devices through USB C
USB20 and 60hz in 2023  Seriously  And the new action button  instead of adding a new button now I have to choose between the mute button I love and new functionality I pay for but not both
Took you long enough
"The main point is
the typec port on iPhone 15 is only USB 20
Slower than my Android phone in 6 years ago"
928 yep I CHOSE FLASHLIGHT S23 Ultra 
Owning only a macbook and an iphone before the lightning port really is a hassle for me soUSB Type C all the way
It is getting hard talk abou new phones
"Hey just curious whenever you go to events like this how many people come up to you and ask for a picture or autograph Like whenever you show a clip of you handling the phone just look at the people in the background Theyre staring and more interested in you than the phone Id probably be the same way

Everyone Wow Look at the new iPhone Its amazing

Me Omg Omg Omg Thats MKBHD over there Stay cool Stay cool "
15  i dont even have 14 
Thank you EU Forcing Apple to come totheir senses
ONE PIECE glass back Neuron Activation Detected
Still when Im correctly Apple were the first to use only USB C on their Macbook Air couple years back to push this port  was around the time when we had the dongle disaster
Gotta respect apple  just the way they get people to buy the same product every year is just a masterclass 
it should be really hard to make a video of a tech that doesnt really change much  Good job man  you have a touch job 
Is the pro max lighter now  The 14 pro max is really heavy
They made a peace of sh
whats new same as old just a waste of money
One thing to note is I think this is the first ever use of TSMCs 3nm node to make the pro chip So the pro phone SOC is the first of its kind This is so truly bleeding edge stuff to the point that Apple was willing to take the loss for all the failed chips that TSMCs very new process yielded
There will not be a long line of people waiting to pick up the latest iPhone 15 Its just another iPhone
607 They greedy AND petty AF 
next year the will launch the iPhone 16 will use an A17 Bionic which will be just a repackaged A16 Bionic remember this 
"Apple is just pure trash Its crazy how people pay so much for that Its like going to McDonalds and thinking you got good food because its popular
Still no 60Hz and people pay over 1000 for a lagging phone that has to be forced to use superior usbc and charges still the slowest of all phones LOL"
Im waiting on s24u with 2 tb off storage 
This is hilarious Apple fans acting like usb C is groundbreaking I have been using phones with usb C for over half a decade Apple still has 20w charging It has been years since I have used a phone with charging that slow I am now using a phone with over 100w charging that charges in less than 20 minutes I am not just hating on iPhone from a distance either I use a company provided one that I use daily for work and hate it The experience is just worse than Android I do envy their chips tho Apple consistently destroys Snapdragon chipsets in benchmarks
The pinkish is kind a cool specially girl will like it
You know what is fucked up this shit Starts at 2199 in Australia for the pro Max
Thanks but no thanks 
How people except 15 hours charging is beyond me
Does EU ruling about USBC has something to do with this move
Are we able to disable HDR photos now
So the worst feature is your favorite feature Mkay
tbh I didnt think I was gonna get the 15 but my 11 just recently kicked the bucket and Ive been stuck on a 5s so upgrading is a must
They just came out with iPhone 15 to meet the September deadline nothing else
If you watched the live event on dynamic island Apple loves Messi
Missed out mentioning the log shooting format in videos thats a big deal
Apple trying to fool the world Edition 23
Really wish they would give us the option to turn off the auto enhance they add after you take a selfie
Still boring and still 60Hz base iphone
Apple getting boring  MKDHDKHD will start to worry
I hope the S24 Ultra will have a Titanium frame and a white color option Will be very desirable
799 dollars i the US is pretty nice In france the base iphone 15 is 969 euros which is 1000 bucks
"About the subject of fast charging I have a 100w charging brick with two usbc and one usba connector on it It charges my iPhone 14 faster than specified 
That saying it wouldnt be a problem fast charging an iPhone But of course youre killing the battery faster I tend to only do it when really low on battery and in a hurry"
Iphone is slowly turning into Samsung  and so the only time you are actually getting a new phone is if you buy the 15 pro or pro max If not you are buying a 14 pro max
cool
perfect to wait for 16 model
Time for Apple to move onPhones industry has became saturated
I love when you post these kinds of videos Whenever you show a clip of you handling the phone at the event I try and count how many people stare and recognize you Youre almost more popular than the actually phone
Bro used the word radii 
can you use a samsung 25w charger on the normal iphone 15 or will it not fast chargefk the phone up
Anyone happy about USBC is not really a tech person There is NO NEED for a port of any kind on an iPhone Its been several years since I used a port in an iPhone Literally everything is wireless CarPlay Wireless Headphones Wireless Fast charging Wireless Data transfer Wireless The phone would be so much better to force people to stop using any ports
commentaire pour le rfrencement
I swear if Samsung did an upgrade like this all these tech youtubers would be going for their necks Its funny how different the yardsticks are for apple and android
Lol USBC with 20 hardware just like my old OnePlus 2 from 2015  And no fast charging which that old OnePlus actually DID have Damn you Apple
My old midrange android has more features than this cutting edge technology apple presented Also imagine paying 800 for 60hz screen in 2023  couldnt be me YouTubers need to find their balls and start talking shit about apple since that company is ass
I really dont get why Apple get this sort of treatment by tech reviewers Heres a company that release the almost same tech every years with little if no more innovation at all And the biggest change in years was actually forced on them by the EU And yet Apple dont get even 10 of the trash other brands are getting for doing way less
"I think the no fast charging logic is due to Apples philosophy of trying to reduce waste and make each phone last as long as possible The faster you charge the more impact to the batterys health

Also no discussion of the GPU supporting hardware accelerated ray tracing These things can freaking run PS5 games and this did not even get a mention This seems like a massive generational jump in graphics performance"
what i dont understand is with apples pro models being the newer chip and then the next year it being the base model if i own a i phone 14 pro and i want to buy a base iphone 15 for the USB type C there would be no point cause its really just the same thing bit silly but people will still buy it anyway lmao
when will you being reviewing this phone because I am honestly excited
Do you know whether the nextgeneration portraits will also be available on iphone 14 pro
My Pixel 6 Pro has had a Portrait Blur on demand tool for awhile now Glad to see Apple finally invent this
Sounds boring waiting for Samsung galaxy s24 ultra and that shit gonna be something else
At this point even Apple isnt excited about the iPhone
Here we go
They didnt add fast charging because they have to have a selling feature for next years phone
The whole point of the back glass is to break when you drop it so you go and pay for replacement typical apple bs
Can I get this famous 
I still have a 12 pro Finally think its worth upgrading now
Getting rid of the cheapest version of the pro max was a good idea because people who buy the pro max arent baseline people we always get upgraded storage so they probably werent even selling that many of the base model pro max because people who can afford pro can afford the extra storage and never just get the base storage because modern high end phones need more than 128 gigs thats just not enough to use your phone freely without getting anxiety about your storage filling up after two years So it was a smart move to make the baseline 256Gigs
Stop lying men its just usbc
The only meaningful change USBC was forced on Apple let that sink in
A loyal apple fanboy doing everything to save their a 
If you dont use cases how do you avoid dropping the phone on your face when youre in bed I NEED to know
"Why is no one talking about how freaking awesome the action button functionality selection UI looks 

I seriously hope Apple does more UI elements like this in future"
Can anyone confirm if that blue Pro is the same color as the blue Pro 12
I dont know how you managed to stretch out such an insignificant iterative upgrade video to 13 minutes but kudos lol Apple is so depressing
iPhone 15 Pro Max is 1800 in Sweden It feels like were paying so that you can have the same price as last year It was 1600 last year
This video proves Samsung  iPhone
The fact the most talked about feature is a USB C port which has been in phones for 8 yearsis wild
"It amazes me how could you be so so hypocrite in terms of Samsung doing actual innovations whereas Apple who doesnt do anything new but you could just brag  brag  brag  brag about them day to night 

You used to be my 1 pick in gadget world  now youre only picked by me to actually see the hypocrisy  nothing else You dont disappoint me here thats for sure"
"Not gonna lie I was left a little disappointed especially in regards to the 60hz display on the 15 and the lack fast charging Everything had already been leaked but I guess its my fault for creating so much expectation based on the last events It seems were back to having an S year

On the other hand I was really pleased to see you being quoted in the beginning that was iconic and you dis that"
iPhone sucks lol Outdated turd of a phone
Anyone else confused why Marques keeps saying the base model iPad doesnt have USBC Pretty sure the whole iPad lineup has USBC
The audio of this video is weird
nothing nothing nothing camera nothing camera nothing
i tried to get android users to convince me to go for a android insted because i need a upgrade but their only argument is that im a idiot the standard android argument  anyway im getting the 15 pro
"Sure was great to see some YouTubers quotes on the event 

Its a nice update but nothing revolutionary I mean USB C is not new "
Titanium isnt actually stronger than steel for the same size of component Titanium is stronger per unit of weight but steel is stronger per unit of volume so if anything the titanium edge is probably slightly weaker its just that its also going to be noticeable lighter
Im pleased theyve FINALLY switched to USBC and maybe next year Ill upgrade my 13 Pro but I just hope theyve improved the ports ability to grip the cable I dont know if it is the ports or the connectors on the cables but so many times the cable just wiggles free from the ports on my MacBook Pro without me realising so my iPad Pro doesnt stay charged or even worse my Time Machine or external drive disconnects Its not good and itll be even more annoying if the charging cable wiggles free of the iPhone
The EU has made it a law that all phones come with USB C charging by 2024 for environmental reasons probably why theyre doing it now cause they have to
That had to be one of their worst keynotes of all time I have literally gotten a new iPhone every year and finally this is the year I will keep my 14 Pro and not upgrade
No fast charging wow apple is always behind but want to raise prices this is why i dont upgrade every year i like usbc tho and i liked they changed the side buttons  idk may upgrade still but shame and also wireless charging still slow Cmon apple
I dont care anymore
17 m in 4 hours cuz of iphone content other than that
Im not interested to watch the whole video because they changed only the type C thats all for iPhone 15
Why they are giving us usbc ports Cause the european union forced them to do it
Camp waiting for 16
Going for the 15 Pro Max in Natural Titanium or Black  not yet sure Coming from 12 Pro Max
Im still using iphone 7 My issue right now is the battery Its hard to decide whether to get the iphone 15 or a powerbank
13mins and nothing Iphone is finished
Commercial break at 1155 regular programming resumes at 1232
I kinda wanna go back to iPhone since I left iPhone for the Note 1 and been a Note fan since Then I would have to change phone watch and headset I dont like that apple headset shape Hard decisions UGH
How did you forget to mention that iPhone 15 has only 60hz for a phone that priced at 800 imagine paying this price for a phone in 2023 if other company did that you wouldve destroyed them
Iphone fake using usb c long ago
same phone as 11 proitss a joke
Will it now ship with a USBC cable now
I thought it was funny they featured you in the keynote even though you throw shade at Apple almost everytime
Thanks for posting
MIGHT IS RIGHT APPLE CAN DO ANYTHING
Got a 13 pro max last year upgraded from the iPhone X and didnt think the 14 was worth it and I gotta be honest I feel the same with this one I dont really see the point
Im definitely just getting the 14 pro max once Tmobile lowers the price for it Moving to that one will still be a big step up from my 11pro Idk maybe Ill get the 15pro max Not sure yet
Im just here to look at the comments lol Always curious to see what gets apple so fans excited
But still i phone has 60Hz why
1107 please can someone explain what is the difference between this focal length and zooming the camera
Tim referred to you during the presentation 
Since the MagSafe duo was mentioned its worth noting that they pulled that and the MagSafe battery pack from their website immediately after the event so you cant buy them anymore Was really looking forward to getting a usbc MagSafe duo 
A bit underwhelming
I dont care im getting the pro max because i can finally play resident evil on an iphone period
This is what EU pressure to Apple has led to its a good start Money talks and sometimes even best has to bend
Hanging out for the pixel 8 pro not impressed with the iPhone 15 series very underwhelming
Complete scam 2023
The default option of changing the camera from 24mm to 28mm or 35mm is aimed at photographers 35mm and 28mm are way more common focal lengths in everyday shooting than 24mm is and focal length ultimately plays the biggest role when it comes to framing
Im definitely getting the 15 plus so that I can use the same charger for my galaxy  23 ultra finally apple went to the USBC 
Ive got the 14pro max and Im actually happy to say Ill be hanging on to this until next year I dont think the upgrade is worth it but it will be if you had the previous models Dynamic island being included and previous chip etc but to change just for usb c and an action button Nah Ill wait
"all hail the EU
They brought apple to their knees 
hell yeah"
For me titanium is the big feature
Mkbhd is the world biggest professional Tech channel
Lol all the iPhones are the same
Should I buy new iphone Im currently using 13 pro max with 87 battery health
"Damn i was really looking forward to Apple charging Apple users a subscription fee for the privilege of unlocking all the benefits USBC
They could call it Lightning Daylight Robbery LDR"
So almost every android phone in existence today has fast charging but the top of the line iphone doesnt and it was just upraded to usbc3 something almost every android phone has already for a decadeapple always lagging behind the rest
Let me guessthe non pro iPhones are still 60hz
1109 now thats a cyberpunk npc
Is there 60fps option for the cinematic mode
Still no headphone jack though 
Thats a no brainer I am keeping my 14Pro max for sure
"So the iphone 15 series has literally nothing more than usb c That too usb 30 in the pro models
Apple fanboys who were shouting about thunderbolts left the chat silently "
Hahaha usb 20 on your phone Really
Mehhhhhhhh the USB20 was a fuck you to regulators Theyre dragging their feet to make a point
They could of done fast charging via USB 3 for all models I know that isnt the best way to do it but Samsung did like 10 years ago with the S5 and it made a huge difference
I was looking forward to the 15 because it was rumored to have much much battery life than the 14 pro max but i am very disappointed and wont be getting one further discouraged by the inflation
Long story short Ill be sticking with my iPhone 14 Pro Max until 17
iphone 15 was a star of show for mepros were kinda same as last year phone
"Instead of incremental and necessary changes they seem to focus on something marketable

I was eagerly waiting for an always on display on the iPhone 15 but Im disappointed yet again "
Thank you so much for zooming in when you want to emphasize a point As if it would fly completely over my head if you didnt do that
Overpriced trash 
Looks just like the 14 really not worth that inflated price  but to a fanboy  guess this will be like finding a gold mine   Also  EU requires all portable electronics to have USB C by 2024 or they can not sell it in EU   This is why they added it not because they were being nice to you  but because its required   Apple will probably say  their USB C cable is the best and if you use any other  itll be worse for you  this is nonsense  and only takes advantage of nitwits who dont know anything about computers
Its the same phone Apple does it again Manages to convince its base to buy the same product each year for more money
333 so thats a white iPhone 15 right Or is it another very subtle color
Currently have the 12 Pro If its true that i can get 1k credit towards the 15 Pro i might cave 
Using a phone without a case is like playing hockey without a helmet
Its 2023 its just stingy as the technology is out there put it in  I want a flagship spec phone with flagship features ie faster charging Not with specs still in fashion with 2013
"Im sorry but how is Apple getting away with USB 2 on an 800 phone in 2023

Like I was already a little disappointed about it on my 200 android phone from 2017 but on the newest iPhone Really How are they not getting absolutely dragged for this They basically copy pasted their phone from last year and then didnt even do the bare minimum on the headline feature"
Mehim gonna keep my 13 mini as long as possible  Love the size manshould of continued line
Not interested at all Long live Android 
I will tell you why they didnt change something like fast charging So that they find something to add next year honestly i see apple as a lazy company who takes their fan boys and customers base for granted Thats why they rarely do something new
Now the last hold out for the lightning port is the Magic Mouse
Focal length is just cropping  confirmed Sth Ive been saying for years
These YouTubers when they covered Samsung unpacked they kept saying same design boring nothing to report but when comes to come to Apple they get excited by new color or finish
Gorgeous little dude MKBHD
And I got a samsung ad here too
Not even gonna comment on the other hilarious upgrades but I am literally watching at my ancient Galaxy S10 and its dedicated bixby button which can be remapped to absolutely everything macros included What years is it Apple 
Sorry but another biased pro apple content thank mkbhd Apple selling the same phone for 4 years now Literally if u have a 12 pro max replace the battery that s it
One more piece of more expensive of course 
I have anker products Theyre fucking awesome Buy them you wont regret it
Samsung beat Apple by several years on the portrait mode software skill Note8 Im glad that it was added to iPhones
The main camera on the iPhone has been getting wider and wider over the years and so have the number of stretched heads at the top of the frame by phone photographers who dont know how to wield a wideangle lens I love the idea of being able to set my zoom to a less wide crop and Id be setting my family members up to do the same Everyone understands how to zoom in and out but few average users understand why the heads of their subjects are so huge and their feet are so small
I dont think anyone with an iPhone 12 or above should even consider upgrading to 15
125 that hair
Fast charge will have to wait for the 17 pro max plus 
"A Titanium chassis is sooo cooool And the typec connector also
And the fact that Tim Apple quoted MKBHD in their event is awesome
Keep growing brother"
Apple as usual out here with the shenanigans and lack of creativity as usual
They made it usb c because they kept getting sued in UK about them using proprietary port that sort of taking advantage of the consumersso now they dont have to make excuse everything now usb c
Whens the mini coming my 13 mini is tired
Is this type c 32 0r 20
Same shit bur usb c
I hate to say it but after owning an android since 15 and having tons of really good devices over the year especially the Huaweiphones which were cutting edge in every single aspect cpu camera battery life battery length fast charge durability build quality Iphone is starting to eclipse Google The pixels are just meh devices  Apple is eclipsing here big time The design build quality features of pixels are justwell  fine the cameras are great but still never Huawei good Google needs to up their game big time before it loses way more ground to Apple
Still no 100w charging
I can only imagine how much a company like Anker will pay to get a sponsored add in an MKBHD new Iphone video
"Apple letting the usb port be slow might be a case of showing the users that they did the right thing by sticking to lightning That nothing would change by going to usb c and it was unnecessary by the EU to force them

If they would had made the port better people would think that the EU did the right thing"
"Apple Innovation

2007  We have a new phone with a UI like never seen before 

2023  Our phone has a different connector"
I think Im gonna wait for the 16 barely any difference from the 14
A 60hz display is depressing
Can you smell what the apple is cooking And it smells like crap
RT in a phone is a lot bigger of a deal than this video is making it out to be considering there arent even that many GPUs that can give a solid RT gaming experience in general
Are we really acting like 25W now its not fast charging Weird nitpick The iphones dont have a big battery a 25W charging speed is plenty Saying it does not have fast charing is just plain misinformation
STILL NO PRODUCT RED PRO MAX
Apple fan channel 
I think apple should drop phones and just start a camera company
I think the 15 Pro Max will be my  forever phone cant wait to get one soon ish and upgrade from my SE 3
Yo man the guy from the video shut out you are you going to sell your Pixel fold for a iPhone
I still feel like I need to be convinced Other than USBC and periscope its not worth an upgrade from 14 pro max
Id like to see Apple increase icloud storage If Im willing to pay more why not allow me to buy more storage
Its so sad theyre not giving us something interesting to buy their new phones Red colour would be enough for us to think about upgrading
Boring stuff Dynamic USB C 
Lol no fast charging Seriously
In short there is nothing new Thanks a lot apple 
Im pretty sure Samsung has a lot to say in February 2024 i dont recommend buying the iPhone 15 yet
If not for almost double the price in India i would love to buy Pro model and 15inch Macbook air 16Gb
Apple milking again
Who cares anymore
Stop buying Apple products
Iphone 15 is a ripoff
is the iphone still a thing 
Not interested in any if the new pixel checks out or if the new flip 6 have a camera upgrade Ill grab either
For me best optical zoom  its X2 For portraits
Why not make the new button do a double and triple press for the option to open more custom apps
Product engineer here Ti is not stronger than SS actually It has a higher strength to weight ratio if youre designing something where being lightweight is critical Stainless is also harder than titanium meaning the new iphone pros will be more susceptible to scratches but will look cool anyways
Only pro models can record in prores and take raw photos Iphone 14 non pro also was designed for easy remove back glass
yes i like
so outdated phone
Base model lookin rough again this year No pro motion no 10 gig USB 3 or technically 31 31 gen 232 gen 2 because they kept changing the name and no always on display My 5 year old Galaxy Note 9 has all that but 120hz and an S20 and later has all that plus 20 gig USB C
a SPONSOR
Sponsored  not objective
Its amazing how Samsung never repeats the same device  Im done with apple and switching to the z fold
I phone are not making sense now
Is the pro max camera bigger than 14 pro max
"Everyone i know in Australia who has a Apple phone carries around their cables
Everyone else just carries their phones Meaning  when you go to peoples homes You know they have a USBC cable for you to charge your phone lol
About time Apple haha"
Fake focal lengths is not interesting
"this is the first time he is undermining how much iPhone is giving compared to previous years Change in 11  12  13 was negligible  14s came with plus  negligible This time there are multiple noteworthy changes with the pricing unchanged

PS I am an android fanboy owned iPhone X as it was a game changer then Planning this time too as again its equally a game changer  the 15 pro Max"
I waited for your thoughts heheh
is it worth upgrading from an iphone 13 pro  to the 15 pro max 
This shameless Apple They made USBC something that needs attention Griffy makes no mistakes about a new iPhone every year
iphone 15s have a 60hz display
I wonder if the action button shouldve been placed lower on the phone side chassis for easier one hand access 
The switch to USB C was just made to comply with the EU regulations Apple wouldnt never made this voluntarily
302 48MP Chip Sensor right
so they removed buttons to let us use the digital buttons for whatever only to then add a physical button again
Strange to go to the effort of engineering a periscope lense to only get 5x zoom from it the 10x on my samsung is one of the things that would stop me moving away
Problem I see with the titanium frame is that it is not actually stronger In terms of sheer yield strength depending on the treatment of the alloy it might be stronger But the modulus of elasticity of titanium is lower than steel This means that the frame will bend and flex more easily And as most people know this bending of flexing of the frame is what really causes the glass back or screen to break in case of a drop Hopefully they negated this by making the frame thicker
Apple is a textbook example of boring nowadays
"320 Im pretty sure that coolest feature is already available in other android phones
He said it like it was something new apple invented"
I want a 15 Pro Max but can definitely settled for any of the lower models Im just so used to my 12 Pro Max that I really dont wanna jump down in size
Is it just me or was the iPhone 15 announcement more interesting than the 15 pro
The USBc was requIred in order to still in the EU market since the new regulations on smartphone charger compatibility
Ive watched several videos and no one has mentioned the cord  Predictions were claiming matching braided cords  Any news on the cords
Apple finally bent over for USB C but in a typical British fashion of not bending over completely Altho I respect that as an individual but as a customer Apple still isnt on my radar yet Ive stopped considering Apple products from 2015 both due to price worthiness and the actual tangible upgrades that you get Apple will say that theyve upgraded the side rails to Aerospace grade Titanium alloy but really will that help you at all No so meaningless But Apple is fast approaching the point where their products altho not worth the money theyre charging but can be considered as a viable alternative Id still give it atleast 56 years before Apple reaches that point Anyways this is a welcome change and Im all for it
Rocking my iPhone 12 for another year
Both the base and the pro version seem to be nice upgrades but non of them will replace my iPhone 12 mini as long as it isnt broken Yearly upgrades in the past were more viable because the jumps from one gen to the next were more pronounced but nowadays not so much So great phones for people who need a new one or REALLY love taking pictures xD
Another failure for Apple
Soon it will be owned by Samsung they make most of the parts and now with the charging port
I love the color light pink of the regular  iPhone 15 but I want the 5x zoom of the Pro max but I dont like its size nor colors or price
aahh new iphone are there more boring videos on YT
But what happens if you use a lightning cable WITH usbc in the other end on one phone and connect the lightning part to the other phone
The problem with the drop is probably the weight of the phone TBH its too heavy to have a free fall and not break
152 he forgot the base iPad already has usbc
Great video thanks Ill keep my 14PM and see how long it lasts 15PM doesnt have a big enough features to upgrade  And the A16 is still a beast
If anything I would go back to Android My iPhone 14 pro feels OLD compared to my previous S20 But I guess Im stuck with the iPhone for a few years now
Yeah I literally have no idea how people have stuck with Apple this long There are just SO MANY BETTER Android phones out there at a myriad of different price points As far as macs theyre arguably better workstations but they literally are incapable of natively running PC games so thats a hard no for me as well Yall have fun handing apple your money for yearold tech tho
It looks the same like every iPhone pass 10 years no longer Its just a bigger camera in the back and at some circle in the screen they call it Long Island iced tea
Camp dont care You know what would be an improvement in repairability Stop having glass backs on phones
How did he not talk about 7 different optical zooms in the pro
My gf wants to upgrade from her iPhone 12 to a Pro Max version either 14 or 15 Are the upgrades good enough to justify paying full price for the 15 pro max or should she wait until prices on the 14 pro max go down
Action button is bixby button done right
They only did USB C because the EU forced them
Great new features I would love to buy the new iPhone however being here in the UK we get ripped off by the pricing 799 or 64112 However since we are charged 799 this equates to 99577 Sucks to be in the UK
i say we go back to the 30 pin jawn for memes
Just here so that i can talk and win the debate with friends 
"for me nubia z60 ultra with 1inch 35mm is the camera sensor game changer
I hate than a 150200 android phone in 2023 have 0120h refresh rate but not a 700 2023 iphone  usb30 speed all iphones as you mentioned these are not expensive anymore that apple as a luxury prestige company to skip on"
Is it just me whos hyped about the next gen gaming I mean resident evil 4 and the new assassins creed are playable on the phone Are you kidding me To me this is the only selling point
"I will never buy an iPhone from these conartist 800 for a regular iPhone and they STILL dont offer 120hz to the  phone Its artificially shut off too The phone literally could do it Dont give me that crap buy the pro then 
If youre paying 800 for a phone it should offer all the features that it is capable of 

Apple started the anti consumer revolution and yall keep taking the abuse Their phones arent that great and have been offering basically the same product since the iPhone x with micro changes year over year"
i am sticking with my 12 pro max great device and Apple gave me more reason to keep it
Its funny how Apple is trying to butterup all these influencers MKBHD is not giving in fully Keep at it 
648 the new design is what people are fawning over i wonder why that is maybe cause apple literally did nothing again as per usual the best thing is literally the colours
Yup Im officially switching over to android this year cause I refuse to buy a more expensive iPhone 14
Theyll go with no ports before TypeC No they wouldnt and we told you bozos they wouldnt How that crow taste
Apple must think were stupid How is this new iPhone any different from the many iPhones that came before I would suggest looking at another phone company as you will get a much better deal with better technology
Disappointed that its the same look as it already is of the iPhone 4
Why did this sound like a review for a new digital camera with a new power supply input Could you do another review where you focus on the parts that deal with communications and any upgrades  Or do phones no longer have anything that is upgradable in this area  I do remember that there was a feature for connecting to a satellite for emergency calls
Love watching that I cant afford
i love the round edge iphone
I think it might mean iPhone could be an alternative device for vision OS  I suspect Or a cheaper version of Vision OS will be using iPhone
Wish the action button had Touch ID built into it for the times Face ID isnt unlocking the phone
Dude there are guys that pay 1000 bucks more for their new phone than I do 
Is it just me or is the video at like 15x speed More like 13x but it seems faster than usual
"Can you gift me iPhone 15 
Love you from India"
That ugly large notch no go for me Samsung shows how it can be done
Ive got the 1 terabyte iPhone 14 pro max Hard pass on the 15  nothing exciting here to warrant an upgrade
Been waiting for your review 
dont care
"Still not the best camera Gives a port that was on my 8 years old Oneplus 2 Same display Same bullshit like last year Changes material of body to titanium but idk who needs that when stainless steel works so good
MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN A FULL BODY TITANIUM DESIGN instead of back glass and titanium body
Even for businessmen Apple is not a great choice since you can natively record phone calls on Android phones and cant in iphones

Yeah Ill just be a true pro user and buy s23 ultra or nothing phone 2 and get a separate dslr because good hardware is much more useful and better than shit overpriced ecosystem"
I was happy for you because Tim mentioned your quote during the event
I had my finger on the trigger but I have the 14 pro and decided that I will see what they do next year
BOOOORIIIINNNGGG
not just usbc       it has got usbc and everything else is the same title bait
Seeking for an upgrade I think its time Going from the 11 to maybe the 15 Not sure yet
Glass is glass and glass will break where did i hear that before 
Thanks the EU law for the usb C
"Iphone 48mp front  camera 
Samsung 200mpfront camera  
Apple you suck says Samsung"
Marques is the only reviewer that I pay any attention to  I trust him to wade through the normal Apple aggrandized hype and get to the bottom line  The entire Apple production could have been done in half the time
Im disappointed it took this much for them to change to USBC Like this shows they could have done this for so long
It looks the damn same since the i phone 12 lol
Uh Anker sponsorship
Upgrade every two years should be best choice for innovation  from 13 Pro to 15 Pro to 17 Pro 
"What you get with new iPhone
A new iPhone "
Now lighting Cable will slowly die off just like 30Pin and will be harder and harder to find soon and lighting Cable will be vintage one Day
6 year old feature is now coming to IPhones nice
I was blown away at what Apple said you can do with USB C on iPhone Charge Data Video Audio My mind is just blown  The thing I do like about watching the Apple launch is that my decision to move away from Apple is reinforced Come on Apple I am still rooting for your come back
The iPhones are getting more and more boring
I am glad I went back to Android
"1 No high speed data transfer on an expensive phone is unacceptable 

2 No fast charging in 2023 on an expensive phone is unacceptable 

As an iPhone 12 user I dont see a point in upgrading which might be Apples intention given the long support they give to their devices 6 years or so"
The power of the European Union 
"1K  with no fast charging  WTF
Was hoping to finally switch to apple to change a bit after so many years with android But gonna wait
I like the idea of the customisable button on the side Nice addition"
Lol same same as an iphone 13 much
Literally nothing of substance Just the EU forcing usbc basically Yet iSheep will jump on this like no tomorrow
I had that afterwards portrait function on my Huawei P10 and Mate20 Pro years ago not just some tacky software thing but it actually took multiple pictures so you could fully change it afterwards Did make very large file sizes though
There is nothing compelling to do the upgrade but I could have or better to say might have moved from my 13 mini With which I am 100 satisfied and after 2 years its still gives more than 4 hrs of screen time to iPhone 15 But I found they are giving 2000 Indian rupees24 US dollars in exchange of my 13mini which is ridiculous So I may wait until iPhone 16 or 17 or might get back to Samsung once my mini says goodbye
they look like Pixel 5 phones
Are we genuinely excited for the new iPhone lets be honest they look the same every year and these so called new features will never be used by your average user innovation has already peaked with iphones
Got me when they said your name in their presentation video 
anyone know what the thing on the side under the power button is
"Im thinking I have the Iphone 14 pro max theres nothing new in the 15 pro max worth switching for I use a case so materials and colors make no difference I am an amateur with photography so its all the same I have AirPods Pro 2 which use lightening so I need the lightning cable anyways 

BUT IM TOTALLY GONNA END UP BUYING IT JUST TO HAVE THE LATEST AND THE GREATEST"
I need Apple to make it where if I long press the home screen it doesnt go into customization mode and I hate the fact that I cant remove the camera and flashlight button off the home screen
"Usb 20 for normal model and USB 3 for the Pro 
Paying 1000 for USB20 in 2023 is next level slave move"
Nothing was mentioned about the 24megapixel mode  no interviews   nothing about the prores features ok that is exclusive to the iPhone basically so it cant not be mentioned or it could lead to a conflict with the narrative that Google wants
We knew it was coming but still kinda surreal to look at an iPhone and see a USB port on it definitely what I feel now
Im in camp I dont care cause Im a Google Pixel user I work in IT though so its my job to know about iPhones too and I watch all your videos  Looking forward to next months pixel 8 launch
Is the regular 15max 120hz display now aswell or is it still a Pro only thing
I want a iPhone with a 7screen
10Gbps is a joke considering USB is at 40Gbps atm smh
Nope USBC is ok but the best feature for me in the iPhone is Ray Tracing built in And AAA games
This is a great example of incremental improvements that stack up to be big changes for people coming from older phones
The cameras are not smooth like the galaxies They still are missing that part
Apple gets forced by the EU to switch to USBC and they still manage to f up all the USBC potential typical Apple
Is the iPhone 15 Plus not new The 67 in nonpro iPhone I didnt hear him mention it
Who made your iphone of course  china  did   but china  banned apple products  so now india is making your iPhone
One question  if you set the action button to be here for opening the camera how do you lock it
Remember when Apple said they it was impossible to go USBC all it took was a government saying no its not and they instantly do it Apple really is just the overpriced Samsung
I cant wait for the fastest chip in all smartphones A18 bionic next year
Type C is nice probably
Im curios about the action button if it is customized to lets say launch the camera How do you then mute the phone Is there a software toggle in control center
Imma pass on this and maybe wait for the 16pro or 17pro
One thing you did not mention is that ALL of the 15 and 15 pro series comes with a USB 2 Type C cable Pros would have to pick up a as Apple stated optional USB 3 cable to use the USB 3 speeds on the pros
Great video As an Iphone 12 pro 13 pro and now 14 pro user Im very disappointed that the optical zoom hasnt improved in 15 pro It is not worth upgrading to 15 pro unless you go with pro max which is too much phone sizecost
Can we say thanks to the EU for the USBC connectivity on the iPhone
Thanks to EU Parliment
No money to buy one anyway lol
i came from tiktok cause i saw u using the red camera
Should i get an iphone 5 pro max or just go to samsung s23 ultra
Trying to figure out if I should upgrade to this or just replace the battery in my 12 Pro
"Apple did not make a significant change this year to the Pro phones
I own the iPhone 14 Pro Max but the 15 Pro Max does not have anything significant to convince me and upgrade my iPhone "
one of the only tech youtuber  whose video felt like i was reading a book it felt like he was talking to me you seriously changing the way of making content much more relatable your style is different i like that
Boring Apple isnt as cool and innovative industry as it was Its extremely boring Every year is so predictable
Im so glad I got the 14 pro future proofed for at least two years 
Only apple could find a way to limit USB C
Apple acts like they do us a favour by finally implementing USBC Apple had no choice but to do it by EU law and milked lighting for as long as they possibly could
bring back the headphone jack and were gold
14 Million views in 4 hours is insane
I buy Apple stuff based on his reviews  absolute honesty with a real no bs knowledge of every product he and his team reviews No surprise he has more subscribers than most small countries have populations
Apple did not do enough to make this phone any different or even better than the 14 for the same price If Apple added a secondary screen to the back of the phone next to the camera that wouldve been different if they were complete wireless charging that would be different but the 15 is no different than the 14
No big difference from the 14 pro max Ill wait on the 16
Marque Im sorry my dude but you are severely underselling the power of this chip the A17 Pro in the iPhone 15 Pro and those is coming from someone whos never even owned an iPhone and is not an Apple fan Like man you have no clue how powerful this chip has to be for it to be running Resident Evil 4 REmake and Assassins Creed Mirage WITH Ray tracing Like its essentially at least as powerful as a whole ass PS4 in your pocket This thing could legitimately compete with the Steam Deck but isnt even half the size of it What Apple has managed to achieve with this chip is a full magnitude greater then anything weve seen in the mobile market This has the potential to blow the roof off of mobile gaming You gotta give credit where credit is due here Marques this is a much bigger deal then your letting on to it being
550  that is RUDE Apple Surely that is not even legal under the EU laws that forced them to change to USBC in the first place Whats the point of having a USBC port if its basically a USB 20 port Thats disgusting But so Apple Plus no fast charging on the port AT ALL Are Apple doing a Disney and intentionally torpedoing their own business Or is this yet another FU to the EU for making them change the port Probably the latter Thats so F1 lol
so when huawei
Not really to defend the charging speeds I wish we would have an option for fast charging but the fast charging does degrade battery faster and considering you want to keep your iphone operational without replacing its battery every year its a good decision to have slow charging which is also pretty fast btw be default
I like the iPhone 15 pro
The color lineup for the pro is the most boring ever
Xdddd
The colors are 
Get one for me tho subscribed love the content 
As if MKBHD needed any more validation Still Apples shoutout is of immense value So its rivals accross the board from Samsung and OnePlus to this now
So not that many upgrades then  besides the big wow of usbc
Yeah the only time I plug in my iPhone is in Apple CarPlay I wirelessly charge my phone I never charge my phone with a wire
Thank you for that brief and important explaining of the new Iphones 
Default focal length setting is so nice to have I always zoom in 12x on my iPhone 13 since I notice 1x has a slight fisheye effect
"To be honest I am done waiting
I still carry an iPhone XS to this day and I cant really continue with it anymore
Having only 64 GB of Storage and a battery that cant even survive a day nah I am done

I am preordering the iPhone 15 Pro Max just because I waited this long and I finally want it"
Love from Bangladesh 
Its funny as hell the new iPhone you only have to talk about usb c
If you compare base iPhone 13 14  15 they are basically the same phone If you give the same colour phone for someone to use in every day activities  they wont even notice any difference maybe with the exception of USBC What a disappointment 3 years 0 innovation
Apple is singular They is plural Learn grammar
"its the freemason Marques hello sir great review my man  did you get the memo French has banned the  iphone 12 
source Apple must withdraw all iPhone 12 models from the French market immediately the National Frequency Agency ANFR announced on Tuesday accusing the popular smartphone of emitting far more electromagnetic radiation than European Union regulations allow
If you enjoy your privacy then do not buy an EyePhone folks Apple like microsoft is data mining i clouds are not safe but to each his own go buy the lastest spy device Eyephone 15"
Im still on the iPhone 10 cant upgrade yet Im going college
"I wanted a iphone 25 pro max as secondary phone  but the charging speeds kill my excitement aswell as this notch

Im currently using a Redmagic 8 pro titanium 16512

But I think I take the Xiaomi 14 pro as second"
Dont be fooled nothing new and its still overrated company
Thats really cool
Titan
Totally not getting
Was waiting for your review aisee 
The innovation that Tim Cooks apple is talking about is the profit of selling the brand thats on a rectangular object thats catching up on
I think the biggest new feature is the action button only because its so freakin clunky to go from phone in pocket to taking a photo with the camera on iPhones Especially when you want to do it quickly
lmao nextgen portrait mode dude my s21 ultra from 2021 has that feature
Where is my folding iPhone 
I am using a 12 pro and still not seeing a reason for me to upgrade Sure its a little brighter faster but for me eh   only thinking I like is crash detection and satellite emergency
"As a photographer the 5x camera is great but man when are they going to allow us to disable the heavy handed noise reduction

It turns otherwise high quality photos into watercolour mush It doesnt matter whether I have a tremendous amount of light from studio lighting or midday sun it completely trashed fine detail 

I took a photo of a friends eyeball with a full lighting rig and the image looks amazing immediately and then a second after capture all of the fine details of the eyeball turn to mush

I can only think that no one at Apple has ever actually tried to use the iPhone to take high quality razor sharp photos"
Should I buy the base iPhone 15
I think I will be keeping my 14 pro untill next year even though my battery health is on 89 after not even a full year of use which I find disappointing since I have been using iphones since 2010 and have never seen such battery health drop on a phone after using it for only one year
The fact that the main feature xD of this new iPhone is the USB C port tells the full story
I believe apple did say that the reason why only the iPhone 15 pro max has the 5x is because of the size and hey Im in the camp that is totally getting this iPhone I mean my current phone is SE2
Shortcuts is laughable just go to the app you want 
So no I have been using this for the past 2 weeks and no ProductRED Whats going on with this world
Can you accidentally trigger that side button It will go out of silence without you knowing it
Ill be waiting untill the iPhone 16 pro      
The fact that usb type c port is the biggest changed for this years iPhones says alot phone progression is plateauing theres almost zero differences every year
Stop paid reviews and save money for your subscribers
We have reached a time where a basic customizable Button is being declared as Marquesses favorite new feature
No real reasons to upgrade from 14 Pro max
jut a small remark about the usb C this is a requirement by the European Commission Not complying with it means gigantic fines in the EU or ban on selling the product in Europe I find the usb C requirement fantastic since one can charge the phone as all other mobile phones The next requirement is heaving an easily replaceable battery  ie when the battery goes dead one just replaces it not trowing away the entire phone smart device
"One of the most expensive companies acting so cheap I bet it will be repairability argument because theres just 4 pins to connect and thus improving it Theyll conveniently be silent about all the other predator tactics they use to destroy repairability
But man having typec at usb2 speeds at devices for this price is just bad And even no fat charging"
They barely change a thing and stick with outdated specs yet people still defend apple
So annoyed the 15 Pro starts at 128gb For the price come on
"Type C on IPhone
Me I used to pray for times like thisjordan meme"
The pink is definitely Barbie inspired 
Its the same as the 14
Sellout
Love how these tech reviewers talk about future proofing all the time when their existence depends on people wanting to have the newest device every year
I really want the new iPhone
Im a samsung user for a long time
And the 15 pro max is still 1 step behind behind the S23 ultra and wait the S24 ultra is just around the corner
Your videos are always fun to watch
Wow  they tried to add samsung features
If you have a 13 Pro Max like I have you most definitely dont need this Unless youre one of those guys that wants the latest model just because
iPhone 13 Pro Max user always feel a bit cheated with the new iPhones Android users have so much choice each year and we get just one take  it or leave it
Marques sound so unbothered here Nothing exciting
Staying with my 14 pro as the mute switch is so much better
iPhones are boring
Soooo iPhone 14 Pro Max S
Literally all I care about are the colours disappointed there are all boring I have issues
Boring Wake me up when Apple does something new with their phones
I would like to see how they did handle sideloading of other app stores Seems no one is talking about that
Whats an Iphone 
"Why does it still not have a mirrorless screen like a Kindle The glossy screen is horrible for reading You need a mirrorless screen protector on it to relieve your eyes
And when will an iPad be waterproof like an iPhone I am still waiting"
Cant wait for Zach from JerryRig to actually tear it apart and jab apple in every posible way there is Or not
Its weird to think how much more underwhelming the new phones would be if Apple werent dragged kicking and screaming to adopt USBC 
Huawei is doomed I am very sure about it
Nothing new apple is running out of new innovations and ideas I think they should learn from Samsung and Oppo
Worst event Ive seen with no real innovation and mostly software updates disguised as hardware What a waste
Titanium is not stronger  it is softer than stainless steel and you can break it way easier than steel It is still way better than aluminium and lighter than steel but tbh steel was better
Wow its like a Galaxy S10 coooool
60hz in a new 2023 phone is lack of decency
Iphone 13 pro until it dies and then buy a google pixel or a samsung
first time i see apple is learning
Definitely getting the 15 Pro Max for Real Estate video
They should remove the word innovation from Apple launche
I will get the 15 Pro Next Year and will hold onto it until it doesnt get supported by Apple Im uprgading from a iPhone X 256GB
I saw on the apple website that the pro models can shoot video in log I found that interesting but the average person dont even know what that means
Samsung had that earlier as Bixby button and then they stopped it Now Apple shows it as a feature 
Didnt Tim Cook say mkbhds name in the iPhone presentation
15 have great colours I love the pink but then its exactly same as my 14 pro so still contemplating
"Gotta say the new base models looks beautiful with those satin finishes and color selection Still a total joke to have them at 60 Hz at that prize in 2023
I generally get the whole ecosystem thing apple is doing to sell their accessories and secondary products but man what an irony coming from the company that once advertised MACs as the smarter PCs because they can talk to every other devices back then mostly digital cameras and dont need drivers for anything"
"Samsung  3088x1440  screen resolution 

Applenot sharp enough"
Ill probably rock my 12 pro max for another year 
Time to short sell apple stocks
Stop Anker
I love the mkbhd quote in the presentation
apple got him yall
Imaging needing an Apple certified USBC cable to get full charging  data transfering speed  Btw this is not a joke
Now i just wish they made different color earbuds
Not Just USBCbut after years the only change which matters for me What I missed in the video with Mother earth was that she asks why they change the dimensions every time so that cases and some other accessories do not fit anymoreTHAT would be sustainable
Thats wrong Titanium is NOT stronger than stainless steel Google it Titanium is weaker than stainless steel but stronger than aluminum but its almost as light as aluminum
will the new usbc earpods transfer lossless quality
"Rather than Universal port I would any day prefer Universal rates  across the Universe Hopefully someday
Like  if you agree with me "
60hz for 800 what a joke apple
I am sooo excited that I am not going to have this phone 
"In the camp dont care at all 
Using the old iPhones for as long as possible"
"I would gladly take some convincing for the iphone if anyone reads this thanks in advance if you do 

The low watt charging is really a turn off for me I really want to get an iphone after using android phones for over 8years now The phones break down way too quickly but nonetheless as someone who uses the phone a lot having to wait for it to charge for 2 hours on the pro max probably is going to be a huge waste of time I dont want to be glued  to the cable but maybe my phone addiction would get better to handle this way actually it might even help hmmm the 100 bucks price up is pissing me off everything else seems like any other phone so i dont know why i would need to buy the newest the camera lenses was the reason for me to look into apple since there are so many custom cases and lenses you can mount on apple products to get even better camera features but the slow charging more expensive then ever pro max is really hard to go for not to forget file sorting that is the thing i do most but I am so confused apple or latest andorids

i like photography for taking reference pics especially wide lens and telephoto shots i also save a lot of pics and have art on my phone that i sort in my file manager  gets automatically sorted by each app i download it from I also love watching stuff on my phone because of oled screens instead of my lcd desktop screens though I also forget to charge so i rely on fast charging  this i can fix 
4 reasons i wanted the iphone
 camera
 lidar for 3d scanning
 it not breaking down after 23 years
 plus more custom cases

4 reasons i love my android one plus
 file management
 fast charging
 more customization in ui and apps
 cheaper"
They finally did it and Ive moved to strictly wireless charging They really do wait until its too late They should have just pushed the MagSafe charging
That action button setting page is so over the top and I love it
I had to disable the iPhones double and triple tap on back functions because I kept accidentally triggering them I imagine the side Bixby button will be the same Also I believe the USBC while I think is better longterm will slightly deter the average user especially without fast charging What a shame
"This Apple event was more like a filmed press release Banal Bland Iterative Unexciting Drab Colorless Boring

If theres no October event with something amazing this is going to be a rough quarter for users and investors"
Its because of the huawei ban that apple is still allowed to release trash after trash
Watch someone break their new iPhone 15 because they didnt know it was USBC n instead shove a lightning cable in there
"USBC  The new btthole of the iPhone  

Not news"
So basically if you dont care about USBC wait until the 16 gotcha 
Shoutout to Marques for making mediocre upgrades seem interesting 
I had to do a double take when I heard M say he liked the opposite to black phone I wasnt sure Id heard right
Ill totally get a new iPhone 16 Pro 
So for me personally the fact that the new iPhone 15 Pro can actually play AAA consolePC games natively without streaming It will actually have Resident Evil 4 Remake Resident Evil Village and Assassins Creed Mirage This is huge for mobile gaming and has actually put an IOS device on my radar for the 1st time ever Like I game on my Samsung phone all the time through Xcloud streaming with Game Pass and it works great at night when I work but could you imagine being able to play those games natively anytime and anywhere That would be incredible
Dont care at all  Waiting for a notch or pill free experience
"I shall not be getting one
I will be keeping my S23 Ultra and expanding my Makita 40 volt tools with the money"
Only problem same triple camera with low zoom  but Im an Apple fan Whatever its fire because of some upgrades  w huge win for Apple with Type C Materials New Action Button and improved chip and camera 
these iphones are becoming more and more of a joke this is an iphone 14 pro with a different color dont let them fool you
I feel disgusted using a iPhone Yawn Boring
marques I m holding 12 pro max doing perfectly well is it good to upgrade or wait till next year
The biggest upgrade on base model15 and 15 plus The new 48M cameraan useful zoom option from the main sensorthat is cool  and the last dynamic Island Now the base models are full filled 
The fact that we would be able to play console games on the iPhone 15 makes it worth of buying
they running out of stuff
Still no higher resolution or refresh rate
Screen refresh rate
iPhone 15 sounds boring Ill stick with my 13 pro max
Gotta love how they manage to release the same thing every year and get people to buy it
I dont think the action button is worth it to buy a whole new phone
No mention of the 60hz
The biggest iphone update  usb c port
"Functionally for the average person usb c is the highlight In terms of power users the action button allowing shortcuts is very surprising and unApple like Still not completely worth upgrading to this phone but maybe the 16 lineup will make some major progress 

As always I appreciate that Marques can do these kinds of overviews without needlessly hamming things up for the views Youtube needs to be able to encourage more creators that can just present the information to you like a sane person"
Iphone
People will buy it anyway
I dont like the Anker sponsor after all the data thing
Its the same phone It just has a usbc port now
thanks the EU for forcing apple to use USB C D
Its time for an upgrade iPhone XR  I know Im super behind so I was just looking to see if this was worth it Definitely looking to snag a 15 Pro Max now
Do not forget who pressed Apple to change to USBC The european union 
Will not and will never buy an iPhone I really like Macbook theyre great bits of kit the iPad as well really great But the iPhones are just the absolute same every single time Super expensive for what they are and their branding is always revolutionary but in reality its ancient
So the main issue is the usb c LOL
Im literally sitting here looking for a fast charger cable for my 3 year old android and this new iPhone has no fast charging 
The iPhone 15 pro max starts at 1600 dollars i Sweden The regular 15 starts at 1000 dollars Ill be polishing my current XS MAX for another year of use
screen still 60hz 
MKBHD the Bo 
Still waiting for a phone company to innovate and start using plastic or polycarbonate as original iPhones again rather than glass or metal Durable cheap lets signal through just better in every perceivable way on a phone Theyre even making the glass so it has a soft molded look now like plastic The vast majority of people put them in cases and cover the backs anyway
i always love to listen to Marques man always keep it real
"I have an iPhone 11 Pro Max Lately it has been giving some trouble I waited to switch to the newer iPhones but it isnt too new this time So out of the 15 Pro Max and 14 Pro Max which should I choose I might get 14 PM for much cheaper I intend to keep it for more than 23 years so maybe they would slow down the 14PM 

Also I have a S23 as my secondary phone but the iPhone is my primary You know for calls reading watching YT etc and some photography 

Thanks"
So this year I am pulling the trigger on the pro time to retire my iPhone X
Lets get it 
XS Max is good enough for me 
Im still upset for the chip international travelers 
Iphone 15 with 60Hz refresh rate in 2023 is absolutely shameless
So is there going to be a color matched USB C cable
"Hi there  Wondered if you would mention being quoted
I am in the poss market for the Watch and waited to see if the new one would be perhaps thinner  but its the same  New Chip and a tap option that will be fun for those with the Vision Pro

But no its not enough for me to get the latest one
Def not in market for a new iPhone as no mini available  They are so easy to use and easier to hold but alas no more  So mine will remain with me for quite some time"
Camp Come on Apple Do something new
"Thats sponsor segment was perfect it didnt feel shoehorned in and got straight to the point there was no rambling on about how go the product was or why it will change you life

It was just perfect in every way"
I prefer lighting charging portUsb c looks cheap in iphone
I still think the jump from 12 to 13 pro is the biggest yet the refresh rate120 way bigger cameras and battery even two years later i think that my iphone 13 pro isnt missing anything that the 15 hasalso like the sierra blue
Yyeah Im definitely 100 going to get an S23 Ultra
They are probably are using a 17pro to give the 16 iphone 18 bionic chip and the 16 pro a 18 pro chip
Cool as all this is Investors arent happy
"Guess you can say weve entered the

 One cable to rule them all one cable to find them One cable to bring them all   era"
i like ur reviews but cand stand super cringe gesticulation u make when explaining stuff
Could you please do review on Huawei mate 60 series
Is it worth getting iphone 15 I really like it but ive always had pro phones
Seems a pretty candid preview  its funny to me though the apple fans are so so excited about something that everyone else has had for over 12 a decade now   Classic apple gimping USBc transfer speeds on their cheap models   The underlying tone I picked up on is the fact theres nothing special about this latest and super great iphone no doubt theres plenty of people out there who feel like the latest version is out there curing cancer or something     Theres fashionably late to a party then theres EU legally put an end to our proprietary charger bullshit but we can still spin it like we care about our end users Heh
the phone he is holding at 956 is it a pro or pro max
Im just getting tired of apple drip feeding us on specs Sure they do the features well and in their own way but they can offer so much more for the same price
So iPhone is upgrading to Android 
I dont understand smth I have not been using the port for data transfers for the past 7 maybe even 8 years Everything is via cloud or some other option data transfer to new iphone wifi etc  Y is every1 so concerned about that You use it 910 times for charging no DDD
I remember tweeting to Tim Cook about a titanium body when I fell asleep on my iPhone 6 and bent it  What are your thoughts on the external recording via USB C
This channel is extremely popular it has had 72k comments in 4 hours
Ill be upgrading to it But Im still on the 12 Pro Max so its about time I do anyway 
None of the upgrades have been worth the hassle and cost of switching  If Apple wants me to upgrade then make the phone more durable waterproof shatter proof 3rd party repairable  The amount of Apple crap I have purchased over the years is an environmental disaster  The batteries alone in the stack of broken iPhones iPads Apple Watches and airpods is environmentally wasteful  Apple sells rare earth minerals and petroleum products that need to be replaced all the time  If Apple wants my money then make a device I can repair on my own  Apples contempt for the customer is why I will wait as long as possible to replace my current iphone
Im still on the 12pro Nothing remarkable except the USBC When it breaks Ill get the 15 I used to love the iPhone so much and now is just utilitarian But I guess thats how these things go
This generation may make me switch from Android to Apple
"Not the same sensor as the 14 Pro in the 15 In the specs listing the 15 has 10micrometer pixels while the 14 Pros are 122 which means the 15 has a significantly smaller sensor 
This checks out in the aperture which is f16 on the 15 and f18 on the 14 Pro Easy to get a wider aperture on the similar sized lenses when using a smaller sensor"
They make out the action button is such a big thing samsung had that for years 
I get this feeling that the Action button will be popular but Apple will realize it should be much closer to the bottom of the phone maybe a couple inches below the power button Then we will get that next year
This photo reblur portrait mode was introduced in Nokia Lumia 1020 years ago I guess someone would remember
youre the only real YouTuber out there that is frank Arun was just very excited he got invited and giving them every credit hes a fanboy anyway 
Im already expecting the iPhone 16 base model to mount the A17 nonPro version
Great videobut Im for Android anyday 
Apple is getting a little closer to Android functionality
1027  Ill ask well see what they say   I like his confidence
The yellow is really a lot lighter which is not vibrant anymore and no yellow silicon case at launch and no more yellow ocean and trail band hmmm need to hunt for older stock before they ran out
Does the normal iPhone 15 has a Promotion feature Or its still 60 Hz
No offense but the iPhone 15 pro max looks the same to the 14 pro max
i love how apple took it upon them to say they choose to put USBC on the new iPhones when really the EU made them change out the charge port or they were banning the sale of iphones due to their new USBC standard
My hot take was right Pro max camera can take the near 360 degrees video for the vision pro so dads arent cringe at birthday parties
Its the fact that Samsung been had the make any picture with a subject into portrait picture even after taking it
I know their are small changes but they still all look the same and that is what I find boring about apple
Iphone 14s claqu
About time welcome to android life apple phones 
I love the 48mp camera coming to the regular iPhones
Good that you opened it with iPhone 15 vanilla and played down the Pro and Max a little Also nice was putting into perspective the overhyped USB C change
Jesus Christ I feel for the sheep 
Ill keep my 14 pro max till die
I never got the big deal in getting rid of the lighting cablemeaningwhen I travelI need more than one cable anywayto charge all my devicesif I only had one cableI would have to charge one device at a timesooooonow theres USBCI would still need more than one cord to charge all my devices at once
In INDIA iPhone 15 pro 128 gb varient price is 134900 inr  1625  usd
Cause if you ever go to china they will destroy your apple devices
"I miss the days where Apple actually was innovative with the iPhones versus  settling all the damn time 

Ive been on team Android since the iPhone 7 came out"
no usb 3 on the 15 non pro is the most apple margin squeezing thing ever
Oh man seems disappointing wanting to upgrade from 12
Im so glad this phone almost the same as my 13 pro Means I wont upgrade for another year
Marques is the best tech youtuber ever 
Whats the refresh rate of 15 and 15 plus You havent mentioned that
I have an iPhone X that is really showing its age and every year I am waiting for Apple to catch up with Android and every year they get further behind I am stuck with Apple because my family share photos that way but I want a phone with a good zoom and a good ultra wide but Apple is 2 years behind The dynamic island is a poor excuse for still having such a massive black hole in the screen Titanium is pointless Also saying nothing about batteries after the mess last year is pretty unforgivable I dont want to buy a 15 Pro until I know that that is fixed Apple is really not delivering but still seems to dominate Thats going to push the whole industry into the slow lane
Im on my 12 mini and I will stay completely uninterested until they make a more attractive 54 model
And who cares how the edges feel Like who doesnt put a case on their phone  And a screen protector
The usb c for the base models is just window dressing for the European market
There is an easy explanation for the focal length presets and it concerns photographers So the default focal length on the iphone is the 35m equivalent of 24mm I believe Its a rather WIDE focal length as your default and that sort of wide lens is not often used A lot of photographers go to 12 and that translates to 28mm a much more used focal length 14 is about 35mm which is really used much more Right now you have to fiddle with the slider manually every single time to get to those more common focal lengths These presets are trying to solve that
apples pricing in other countries is crazy normal base iphone 15 is going for 1125usd 12000nok in norway and 1018usd in germany949euro iphone 14 base model launched for 1028usd in norway11000nok and iphone 13 base launched for 916usd in norway9800nok         all off these price increases are criminal since the iphone in us has always remained at 799usd
Keep your android phones
Im honestly pretty dissapointed that the moment they standardised the matte glass design they also killed the Product Red colour scheme Wouldve loved to see what a Product Red iPhone wouldve looked like with the matte design
Nothing so interesting not worthy of an upgrade
Not liking the colours 14 yellow is better than 15 yellow
                   1000                            128GB                         60 Hz     360 Hz                       
basically an iphone 14 pro updated 
The ability to change any picture taken to portrait was already in Google Pixel 5 there is nothing revolutionary about this feature 327
Could you review Huaweis Mate 60 Pro  when it releases globally It seems like a very interesting phone finally with 5G and some features that other phones dont have
Apple is really paying you guys
The best video of the impression of the iPhone 15Surely Ill upgrade to 15 Pro Max in the next 5 years My XS Max is still running fine
Nah Ill keep using my 12 pro  O wow they added some zoom and USB c
"60Hz in 2023 when 300 Androids have had 120Hz for years
Apple being Apple"
You can thank the EU for that USBC lol
So its just the usbc
Please do a comparison to the s23 ultra
THE MAIN CAMERA IS NOT BIGGER THAN THE ONE ON THE IPHONE 14 PRO  Why is everyone saying that  Its still 48mpx 122m Pixel size Also the ultra wide is the same did we watch the same event
"They might implement fast charging next year might lol only reason Apple put in USB C as we all know is because they got black mailed by the EU not like that was a bad thing lol
Also both ends Apple and Android top tier phones sound boring now vs past years
Edit also no reputable photographer would EVER use a phone as a camera even if their main one broke theyd have a backup If the backup broke or is broken or is their phone demand a refund"
Your name was everywhere  you made it 
Ecosystem only features is a bad thing Kinda like airpods features limited to ios Its anti consumerism and if you dont see it you are a blind follower and will hate on me I am glad they were forced to usb C
Im in the camp Waiting for the previous iPhones to get cheaper 
"I think again giving 128 variant for 80 k and ush 20 I guess is really not acceptable also still the refresh rate is 60 hz common Apple
Also user who doesnt own a mac or iPad what about the brick 
In event they did not specify on the battery
toO
Its not worth from upgrading to 15 from 12 i guess 
Thinking of switching to android again 
Ps  blue looks kinda cool"
This seems like Apple hardware and materials engineers have been busy with other things so iPhone isnt the top priority this year like it has been in previous years Spatial computing could need refining in preparation for launch but if you see how Tesla is beating most of the legacy auto maker competition could it be that Apple is gearing up their car Could the myths be true after all
I am disappointed with that iPhone 15 pro max nothing new there  
You traveled to see USB c wtf
Oh wow A custom mappable Thats some spicy news Just kidding Its nice but nothing new
Given they said you will be able to record video straights to an external drive on an iPhone 15 Pro Im expecting a MagSafe SSD drive with built in USBC cord
Now apple products sunny be coming with a cable at all Theyll assume that everyone has a typec cable just as they assumed everyone has a charging brick
"Great review 

To answer your last question 

Im probably going to be rocking my iPhone 13 Pro Max for another year 

Works fine still and I dont really see a compelling reason to upgrade yet 

Dynamic Island is nice and the new cameras are nice but my phone already takes fantastic pictures so  "
think differentappleplease
Apple literally be DRAGGING THEY SHIT  so ridiculous Only reason I havent switched to android is because of apples ecosystem that I actually like but DAMN BRO stop taking advantage of your CUSTOMERS
the USB C is a big changer
So theres no other iphone dropping this year right I thought we were getting iOS 17 as well
Didnt they say in an official interview a few months back that there are other ways than using USBC to comply with the EU regulations You made a whole video about it I feel like you should have commented on that and what it means about Apples strategy and politics Misinforming your users should be a serious thing in such a big company Otherwise great content from you as always
Im hiding my type c chargers Shes  coming soon
when the first iphone came out it was huge very future the real big deal but now even type c on the iphone its not about future anymore too old for me the most oldest type c ever
Lighting cable is way way way way better than type C  Dont know why they switched 
i miss steve jobs
EU should force Apple to not release phones until they create new phones
Im watching this video with an iPhone XR 
Im in the wait for the repairability reviews camp Id love to have the pro max for those sweet cameras but Im not into remaining in the apple world if the repairs keep being so expensive and walled
Apple wants the average user to upload their photos to the Cloud rather than manually transfer files to a hard drive hence why theyre reluctant to give fast data transfer speeds
Should have switched to USB C years ago
Android users Meh
damn instead of watching that hour and a half boring and cringe Apple Event I should have just waited for Marques 13 minute video
Wow iphone pro has a custom botton i had one on my old lg f6
Dont care at all 
So where is the 17 non pro if there is no pro version doesnt that mean that the pro version is just 17 non pro
You know why the chinese shut down  apple bannedcause apple was making fun of the chinese phones like huawei phone
Damn lightning cable is dead Apple has to share a charger with Android  and they have to have removable batteries by 2027 will yall still call Android users broke Yall bet not drop it or ya batteries are sliding 
apple got sanctioned like huawei
Never  thought Id say this but the iPhone1515 have become a compelling product maybe this is the one to get this year
Boring No split screen view in 2024
Its the same fg phone
great USBC   thank you EU
"We have to wait and watch for the camera upgrades How much is it better than 14 pro max Is it noticeable This will be a game changer for me to go and click the pro max 
Still no 960fps  
Pixel 8 pro is next "
"Nothing much better

Practically the same"
How many more times will apple fans buy the ssme phone 
"If they did thunderbolt speeds now then how would they sell next years release They have already massively upgraded it according to apple by adding USB C next year they will boost its speed to entice sales then they will boost it further to maybe 20gbit then once the USB novalty has withered they will add some sort of 4K8K monitor support with a thunderbolt USB connection

By the time this happens pretty much all midtop teir androids will already do this At some point the 35mm jack will probably make a comeback under the guise of hires audio as that currently isnt possible via bluetooth god knows why nobodys using wifi to achieve this instead

Keep climbing that ladder people its making them so much money"
Waiting for iphone 20 when it finally has all the features Android has today
I hated that they kept saying usb 3
Iphone 15 The 2023 Iphone 14 pro
233 thats a lie
I have 14 Pro not upgrading but Id get the 15 not the Pro if I would have to pick one
Apple save fast charging for iPhone 16 pro
The iPhone is looking more and more like an Android both on the software and hardware department yes theyre late but I dont hate it
"457 Faster raytracing which isnt new 
The A17 Pro is the first smartphone chip with hardware raytracing"
couldnt care more than to watch youre video to be updated and give you a penny Im good with my galaxy s10e thank you
Those pillows and event IDs stuff you did behind thats neat 
Titanium is technically NOT stronger than steel More expensive and a bit lighter premium but NOT stronger
Wow game changer
His bias shows Last years Pro repackaged No Last years Pro has several upsides Ive seen so many people say the same crap and now I know where they got it from Just because they shove in last years chip doesnt make it a repackaging of last years Pro This is why I cant take this guy serious Be honest with your viewers dont try to upsell these phones when you KNOW last years Pro is straight up the better deal
The crazy thing is that the Galaxy S23 is still better than the iPhone 15 
Eyyy welcome to 2014 lmao
The old ones are going to get cheaper The only real thing I look forward to in Apple events
Apple is something else They are legit milkingcharging and data transfer speeds What the actual 
I dont have a very good reason to upgrade my 12pro maxand my watch series 3 the only reason I think is worth to upgrade is to get the trade in value before it depreciates even more
As someone who hasnt used an iPhone since the X Im incredibly excited for this one USB C was a major plus for me all of the camera and portraitmode changes are a huge appeal 
Apple needs purging like twitter Too much wokism snowflakes and sjws They should keep their stupid politics to themselves and just focus on making their products better
apple limiting usbc potential can be seen miles ahead lol it is just classic apple at this point
Apple being apple cant provide free fast charging
Im waiting for the iPhone 16 so that I can get the 15 on discount
Great announcement review i am def sleeping on this one my 13pmax feels perfectly fine and to me the new phones dont feel like i need to upgrade Time to wait for the 16 and maybe a whole redesign
I hope everyone realizes youd have to be mentally challenged to buy an iPhone 15 at this point They release a new phone every year and their iPhones havent changed since the iPhone 8 Small changes that keep the idiots occupied like a slightly better camera
This year was the least interesting year for apple ngl 
Iphone users now can access features from 2015
"Ay playing console games on iphone is a total new era
Why no one appreciates it"
"So the 1200 15 Pro Max no longer has a portrait lens 

2 gimmick cameras for 1200 

Just wow"
Iphone 15 dont have wifi 6
its still mind boggling that i phone15 in 2023  woundt give  us 120hz screen  and marques  u dont criticised enough  about  it  u being tech guy u just  let it go under  like not a big deal  it is big deal and should be a big deal  or Marques  doesnt want to be mean to apple  coz apple wont mention him in apple event   so Sad 
I just want a phone without an island notch or hole punch It ruins the immersion while watching videos on the phone Its annoying and frustrating that its seems to be the trend
I usually get the Pro every upgrade My last one was X to 11 Pro and Ive not had an upgrade since 11 Pro has been a great phone mostly for the first year then it just went downhill from there with the noticeable performance drop since the newer iOS updates Idk though if Ill bite with 15 or 15 Pro price and features play a roll I mainly just want another phone that works great not just for one year but for at least 23 years Apple has this thing where iOS updates makes any phone older than 2 years old perform not as well forcing you to upgrade Ugh well see
This paperweight actually has features Whod have thought
Great video as always But if the USBC is the best thing of the new nonpro iPhones than Apple obviously missed the point of a refresh
"I will not buy it because it has squared angles Thats it 
I love my iPhone 11 because it has rounded edges I will not buy a new iPhone until they bring those back I dont give a shit about anything else I just wanna feel the roundness in my hands Am I crazy"
So Apple havent Settled
no mini so dont care
Thanks EU very cool
not much of a tech guy but is it possible to enable fast charging through a software update with the Pro Models I hope its possible to enable
I want to see the iPhone 15 pro in real life to compare the cameras with my iPhone 11 pro do I update or wait another year If they included that new lens in the regular pro the choice would have been easier but the 15 pro max may just be too large too drag with me every day
How How  HOWWWWW can you Finally upgrade to universally standard USBC and NOT have higher charging speeds Criminal IMO 
Your wrong  snapdragon  is still the fastest  chip
The colours of the standard iPhone 15 makes it look like a kids toy not a fan of them at all It was super underwhelming That said I think the 15 Pro is gorgeous and easily the most exciting product Im looking for a new phone and the Pro Max genuinely temps me
I really dont care at all about the change to USBC I always charge with magsafe I transfer data via AriDrop And all my photos  Videos are in the iCloud So I really dont care
This was the worst showcase I thought No improvement on battery life either
"Starts from 799USD  1499AUD This is absolutely disgraceful 
Pro Max in AUD from 2199"
For a company that boasts how innovative they are moving to usb c due to a regulation also proving it was never a technological reason but laziness to change the port goes to prove how greedy and non innovative they actually are Also 60hz on any phone of this cost is criminal do better Apple
Why does it feel like the video is speeded up a bit Higher playback speed than normal
0755 is the 15pro color natural identical then watch pro 2 color Or close
im an android guy myself but its interesting to see apple making steps in the right direction maybe a few more iterations and i may consider one myself
Next year  pro with USB 4 and base with USB 3
sucks how theyre differenciating the pro and pro max i was going to downsize to the pro but now idk what to do
"The 15 is to the 14 what the 11 was to the 10 No one gave a crap but its just a slightly better phone in every aspect
I still rock an 11 because it aged extremely gracefully and the cameras are in my opinion better than the ones after Not on paper but the later iPhones just look too unnatural Harsh bright colourful The 11 has a muted quality to it that youd usually see in real cameras Though the 15 probably still wont have the camera I love this does seem like the iPhone that will go unnoticed I expect to buy one of these when the 17 comes out D"
IPhone just resells the same phone every year in my opinion
So are we going to get a new Magic Mouse and Keyboard with USBC  These will be the last pieces of the ecosystem that I own that I will need to keep those silly lightning cables around for  I mean what a great cash grab opportunity for Apple new keyboard and mouse sales just so people can ditch lightning  So Apple
Im in camp DCAA I guess My phone is always a Pixel and my tablet is always an iPad and I have no plans to change this anytime soon 
Youre the first YouTuber who figured out why the nonPro phones only had USB 20 speeds The answer was obvious especially after Apple showed the USB controller to be on the SoC Since the iPhone 14 Pros didnt have USB 30 speeds it was obvious the nonPros wouldnt either The other YouTubers were scratching their heads wondering why Next year the iPhone 16 nonPros will have the A17 in some form and will probably have the faster speeds
new 
The Bixby button I can changed everything Too Steve jobs would fire everyone
Which colour is nice in new line up of iPhone 15 pro max series
We dont need 2000 nit peak brightness We need at least 90 hz for the basic iPhone 15 range
Question can you use a non certified USBC  cable just to charge your iPhone
I really wanted to upgrade my iPhone 11 but there really is no point  The 15 is a little fast has a slightly upgraded camera and usb c but I use wireless charging so I dont care about that Its not worth a 3 year contract at around 50 a month Disappointed 
future proofing like not having a sd card what a praise
Wow USB slot ground breaking lol what took so long
Man I hate you guys copying us with the usb type c 
Im not upgrading going keep my 15 pro max
"One of the games they displayed is Resident Evil 4 Remake its a PC game 
How do they show that in the iPhone are they making a fool out of people or are they really rendering some parts of it"
Soo no Iphone 15 Ultra
For me this is not a USBC port The idea was that you could use your existing cables but for unrestricted use you need an Apple certified cable a new reason to never buy an iPhone
"A very good comprehensive and unbiased view on the phones can tell why this video is as watched as it is 
Agree on the titanium upgrade  the previous models are strong enough as its the screen that always breaks cracks not the case when the phone drops Overall some decent upgrades however"
Aint UsbC 32 thunderbolt so 60watt charging on ProMAx
Camp Dont Care At All Waiting patiently for the 16
Same phone Different year Thanks apple
Not bad but no reason to upgrade
WE WELCOME APPLE PHONES IN THE WORLD OF NORMALLYUSB C is here 
They are saving fast charging for next years iphone  Upgrades are harder to come by these days and planning them out in advance is necessary now  Of course it will only be om the Pro version then too  That will give the next next years regular iphone a new feature too
The best part for me was the earpods now are USB C
Nothing new with iPhone Same design just a little bit better camera and usb c Thats it That chip aint gonna do difference at all Usually people using iPhone they just text and email and just playing stupid games
No mini 
Marques may not be pregnant but he never fails to deliver
You can thank EU for iphones headliner USB C 
For the record when the worlds top tech YouTubers favorite spec isa button you know the phone is as bland as they come
"Same but different
But
Still the same"
You forgot recording videos to external SSD this is a game changer all the rest is mah
Man I liked lightning cable no no damn usb c
Felt like one of the weakest phone launches from Apple so far Only real difference I care about is the USBC connector but I wouldnt buy a new phone just for that
Still rocking my 8 plus which I bought in 2017 November I am good and can wait for the 16 
Due to how I am this will be in my hands sooner rather than later
no fast charging in 2023 yikes
France banned iPhone 12 in their country these days So you still want to buy iPhone 15 Well I am definitely not And the biggest feature in iPhone 15 is USB TypeC Someone in Apple is kidding a lot
I think USB C is a great move forward Back in the time USBC was the same at speed as a classical miniusb but it was more comfortable to use And when it come to mobile phone  I would love to have some comfort improvements
Very little in terms of the wow factor I dont think people fall for the hype when Apple adds tiny incremental updates any more
Why i am getting a samsung ad   everytime when i am clicking on iphone 15 video
I have 13 pro max and s22 from android I dont see any reason to make the change Perhaps next year
Camp Android 
Watch next year  samsung  is going to upgrade there 45 watt charging to 65 watt charging
Would it be worth to switch from the 14 pro to the 15 pro
Im upgrading just for the damn usbc I travel a lot and yeah 1 cable is as minimalist as it gets
I wonder which iPhone will have the best battery 
New iPhone Looks like the 14 line 
I wont get rid of my 14 Pro gold just yet
The introduction of the USBC has led to an increase in data trasnfer speeds Hm I seem to remember when Apple was claiming that imposing USB on them would stifle innovation 
Iphone 15  No Samsung s23 Yes 
Maybe its just me but its kinda sad that Apples most popular devices biggest new feature is a port android phones have had for 5 years
Much love bro
I want to understand the philosophy and strategies of this company
No thanks Ill see what the 16 or 17 bring to the table before updating from 12 pro Max which is perfectly fine and fast
"I use dislike not for you  
for the iPhone  this phone is ridiculous  still iPhone  very small upgrade and worth nothing  
they use type c with faster charge  they are joking  
and I dont know every year I still heat this company to much  because they joking on us"
0 innovative same boring stuff every year iPhone well done 
This is the worse apple has ever been doing in my opinion All the new changes are beyond too late to be appreciate at just value yes they are great and were needed but that was half a decade ago The one thing they did not need to change the one thing no one complained about the most and only iconic left on the Iphones has now been removed and replaced with a button Getting rid of the silent switch just makes no sense to me but I guess Apple saw a need who knows Overall this is the most disappointing Iphone release ever
So thats the new iPhone cable my friends will be asking for D
Super expensive I dont have enough income to buy
Yea literally what Samsung has done I have a s23 ultra and bought a 13 mini few weeks ago because I find value Man apple is such such
Thinking to upgrade my 13 pro max to 15 pro max
USB C is nice Smartphone
Im in camp android user but happy iPhone is switching to USB C because well benefit from the change as well
Any discussion regarding battery life
Guys samsung came before apple did
i just broke my iPhone 11 completely now so Im planning on buying it
Nothing exciting New materials  USBC Meh
I went from watching every Apple event live to playing 1 short video at 2x speed and not really caring at all Nothing they announce is groundbreaking or exciting anymore
Only Apple can turns something thats Universal into a discussion point 
Time to throw all the light cable out which we have been collecting for years and buy a Samsung charger
They also mentioned the cobalt in their batteries is now recycled If you quickly search where does cobalt come from youll notice how big of a deal this is
Pfff only slight design changes nothing new to see in the new iPhone
they really should have brought mouse and keyboard and display support like the iPad has  Missed a big opportunity
That customizable button is more impactful than it may seem Having a button you never use is a complete waste and actually bothersome for some Its really nice it has enough options for everyone to make good use of it  not to mention the fastest method for opening the camera app of any iPhone
it feels like this isnt a big enough upgrade from the 14 Plus so ill keep my 14 Plus lol
Up until now Im still surprised Apple dont raise the prices for the iPhone 15 pro models
Hello If i would buy the new iphone 15 or another device apple watch airpods from the United States would it work properly in any country of Europe What about the warranty
If they really keep the last years 14 pm 256gb price I will just trade in Problem is that in my country some colors alone bump up the price by 20
"And not a word about no iPhone mini 

I think the best iPhone they made in years was the iPhone 1213 mini and they should bring it back"
That customisable button should also have included screenshot option which is big feature for me on Android Thats why I always stuck with Android mostly Also extra buttons like google assistant button have always been my thing on Android like remapping it to my liking I always have said this to my friends or to myself that if I get customisation on iPhone the way it is on Android now I might switch to iPhone But Im sure screenshot option on this iPhone would have been an excellent feature for many maybe in future updates or by 3rd party app
no ones talking about the 60hz screen still in iphone 15 lol
Camp Android die hard willing to test daily drive it
The most lacklustre update ever One button on the side usb c and bunch of software tweaks and general incremental jump in tech speed
Maybe Apple thinks that fast charging will kill their batteries faster 
Anyone noticed when Apple CEO made reference to Marques review on Apples product It was fufiling knowing that MKBHD reviews is a betchmark for APPLE 
It doesnt feel like 120 herz it feels like 90 herz
I bought an iPhone 14 earlier this year after my old phone broke I was considering buying a cheap android phone until the iPhone 15 is released but now Im glad I didnt wait I miss when a new phone release would actually be revolutionary Now its just the same old phone with minor changes
to not waste your time its only USBC
The only innovation Im excited about is the sideloading That it was enforced by the EU So  yeah
Your name was mentioned in the apple event 
Apple is such an evil marketing genius They put the word promotion to 120hzand they dont even intend to bring it in the nonpro iPhones that cost 800900
I rarely use the 1x focal length  i am excited to try the 12x default option
Apple forgot to do something this year NEW
Usb c is a huge victory from the EU Im honestly surprised Apple didnt just make usb c a thing in the EU but Im not surprised 20 is in the base ones
COMERCIALS
A nonevent
I can see you are Disappointed and Aggressive
If it wasnt for the EU laws we would have lightning until the end of timealso all the green washing in the presentation was hard to watch
Its astonishing how in just a couple of years the tech industry went from not inviting any YouTubers to their events to having Apple quote Marques in the opening presentation about the MacBooks  That was truly thrilling to witness 
first time seen one of your videos like the no  nonsense review
Typical apple with the not updating fast charging and making it as bad as the lightning  But apple lovers rejoice Welcome to 2016 with USB C And u actually can fold and flip ur iPhone 15 It just will creack and crack a little but disregard that its a apple feature so u know u actually folding flipping it 
Great reviewI dont se the big difference between the iPhone 14 and 15 that would make me by the new iPhoneIts just a money machine that wants your money and nothing elseBut great review you rock brother Marques
"Great video
The lineup is decent the new features are welcome but still not convicned to upgrade from a 12 mini "
"Using the good old OnePlus 7 pro around 4 years already and now its finally the time ill switch to iphone i was waiting for the usb c to finally arrive to the iphone abd here we go 

 A bit disappointed that theres no fast charging thu"
Certainly not a world changing update but with iPhone upgrade program Ill welcome the lighter slightly smaller phone
"Marques  please check one more time On presentation they reveal than pro max has 25 larger camera sensor  I am sure because notice that so much
Timeline 11600 because of this optical 5x zoom they make it bigger"
I suspect the usb3 thing is cuz of prores video on the pro models
Scam
Its hilarious to think that apple made these changes because the EU basically forced them
With the qualcomm snapdragon 8 gen 3
So something people dont seem torealize Titanium isnt stronger than steel It has a higher stregth to weight ratio but i cant see how that would matter in aa phone It will probably be easier to break this one
"I wanna buy it
And Im looking forward to Iphone15 pro case
I like USBC port so l wanna buy itl wanna buy it"
Im done with iPhone for good 
I think the 16 could be something to watch I might skip this model and get the next one being as my 13 Pro is still going strong
Im still on the iPhone 11 Pro Max and Im trying to figure it out if its worth it to upgrade keeping in mind what I use the iPhone for Waiting reviews
"I expect Iphone 16 to be a great improvement over the rest Apple simply cannot afford to not innovate for this long since X12 And if they dont Well someone else will come up like Samsung To hell with Apple at that point Their sales will really take a hit this year As for titaniums lightness Just 20 grams 110 of weight reduction Thats pointless too May as well have not bothered at all Itll still feel heavy to lift at night holding it up Like MKB says Apple is so powerless so uninnovative that they brought USB C port WITHOUT fast charging They want to wait another year WHAT
Like I said they simply cannot afford it anymore The jig is up"
Ever since samsung  super fast charging I think samsung still wins
Fast charging will be main focus for apples next years iphone launch Mark my word  Today we are so excited to introduce for the first time the industry leading revolutionary fast charging
I guess apple ran out of invesnsions 
"new anker products for the new iphones
30w charge the iphone is still 1820 max lmao"
Am i dreaming or was the change the portrait mode later feature already a thing
Thanks for the updates brother
so they got nothing new
I havent cared about the new iphone ever since they introduced the iphone 10 Seriously why still make such a fuss about a phone thats been the same for ages with only incredmental upgrades Phone reviews of non foldables have been uninteresting for ages now
Im sure they will invent fast charging next year
All these ppl ogling a phone that looks the same as it has for years So little is different they lose their minds over the shape of a plug Such is the power of the cult of Apple And yes  I want one coz it has USB C too  
"As a software developer myselfI wont buy this latest iPhone Apart from small changes there are no app and software changes in this model And if you have used an Android for a while then you would understand what Im saying 


Teams call and FaceTime calls are displayed in the same recent screen which makes us confused and sometimes misses the contact

Only 100 recent call details are available with no proper consolidated single contact call history display

Transferring data from the laptop is kind of a hectic process where we cannot directly transfer It especially MP3 files

What is this with the new notch Its kind of not pleasant to see the image or video when it has a middle cutting 

In settings we cannot turn off notification of all the apps together and each settings has to apply for each app Also the stacking of the app is kind of weird if you look at it 

Why card additions in wallets are not available in India 

And they are bringing up small changes and expect us to upgrade Nope Im not gonna do that And yes if you want its better to use pro Max than basic and pro models 

The list goes on So Im going to wait till they drop some major changes else Im gonna buy myself the newest Android phone which has better features than the iPhone

I would consider this as a scam As there is no new innovation involved Just basic things they changed with no fast charging face lock and 6 digit password entry being a pain in my a blacking out when space run out instead of showing alert 

"
he said future proofing lol
Id trade all those things for the addition of a fingerprint reader   There are times when this would be very convenient  For example when youre in a long meeting and want to discretely glance down at your phone to check email without having to pick up your phone and let everyone in the meeting know
Never owned an apple product have always been android but im thinking of getting the 15 pro max this year to see what its like on the other side 
Just happy watching your videoCant afford and its to luxurius for me
"Love the new iPhone 15 pro max 
And one day ill get one for myself"
Thank you European Union for forcing Apple to have USBC Without you customer would be slave still of this Lighting enslavement from Apple
They apple copied samsung
The crazy thing is that apple helped developing thunderbolt technology and decided to use USB 30 
Same sht as always
Is the 120hz more enjoyable this time  My 14 pro feels more like 90hz most of the time and rarely at 120hz maybe just gesture animations
Finally iphone just accepted the reality
"Its All Bad
USB C has been around for EIGHT Years Somewhat longer than a couple of years  and  was forced into it by The EU

Bottom line  Still Sucks"
I am glad they are finally adopting usbc Im not a big apple fan but im glad that there will be less confusion with charging Now we just need them to support rcs and open the apis for their peripherals watches
very interestinggg but i dont care 
Bro youre a technical art piece I have to give it to you
The phone is disappointing especially the new design of the mute button It is strange What if I accidentally press this button The phone will switch to silent mode without me noticing especially if you have children I think it would have been better if they kept the mute button as it was and added a customization button
and still no reason for me to get rid of my GREAT iPhone 11 Pro with 100 battery   that right 100 battery   no reason at all   your review is honest and straight forward  you are at the only reviewer I watch because of this  people that feel they need the latest iPhone every year are pretentious and have low self asteem  like a 16 year old girl
Base iPad 10th gen has usb c already I just bought one for my daughter and I was surprised it was a C when I went to go charge it
They shoulf call this Iphone 14S
Apple always behind
I was worried I was going to get bad GAS Im happy with my iPhone 13 Pro but I got a bit twitchy when the 14 came out but honestly Im super happy with my phone and I dont think there are any updates here Im desperate for
"Im a little bit scared by the fragility of the usbc The data transfer time is faster with the PRO phones only so it means that the new iPhone 15 has a more fragile port in comparison to the iPhone 14 with the lightening cable and both have the same speed Dont like that
At the end of the day I have a 12 Pro and it is still perfect No need to upgrade unless it dies the 13 Pro or 14 Pro could be upgrades and if refurbished even better I mean theres no real difference between those phones in everyday use unless for very specific features"
"Thinking about it before the event like you were I thought 3D video would be the obvious one more thing  wow feature for the new pro phones

Theyd tie it in with so when you get your Vision Pro starting next year youll already have your favourite videos to explore in a new way

I was so surprised NONE of the leakers professional guestimators were talking about it

Im not that surprised Apple didnt actually do it I guess they want the ecosystem way to view 3D videos to be already be out But when has reality stopped a leaker from hyping a cool future feature "
im exited that console quality games are coming to mobile alien isolation mobile doesnt have to be so alone anymore
"So as usual with every new iPhone
Slightly better cameras
Slightly better performance
Slightly tweaked design that you cant tell apart from last years phone unless youre up close
Adding features that have been in competing phones for years and touting them as new
Not fully utilising the capabilities of hardware changes
Intentionally gimping lower end phones

The phone market is just getting worse People will flock to buy the new iPhone just like they do with new flagship Samsungs but the majority of people have zero need to upgrade I still see no reason to upgrade from my Galaxy A72 and see less and less reason with every new release Add to that the fact that even midrange phones are now following flagships and dropping the headphone jack sets a pretty poor precedent"
The action button has been on Android for years I will say I will miss the old mute button You could easily tell without even turning on your screen whether your phone was mute Now they have got rid of that They could have easily put the action button with another button like volume or anything
"Wow the last phone on the planet to get a USBC portal to the new world
Next iPhone 16 Pro Fold  Flip"
What are your thoughts on the spatial or 3D video capability I thought that was an important announcement But if its only useful to the very few people who can get their hands on a vision pro next year I can see why you didnt mention it
Still a 60hz refresh rate on the 15
Stick with my 14 pro max thanks
wow this is generally great hope i can get this new phone before this year ends
Im not really that dissapointed about fast charging missing Like okay if it was possible to turn it on or off it would be nice but Id rather charge for 3040 minutes to go from 30 to 80 and have a healthy battery after 3 years
Sad apple event nothing to really say buy me No mini iPad or iPad in general upgrades either It feels like apple needs a fresh team with a fresh vision
Congrats on the shoutout from Apple Thats definitely a milestone to be proud of 
I wish the action button can do more than one action with different button press patterns single click double click long press
subtle biz class to SF flight
"Ty to EU they wont let any Electric device which doesnt has Type C to be sold in Eu

This is great money  time saving and of course its great for "
"The reason the normal 15s only have USB 20 speeds is that they have the 2022 iphone 14 PRO chip That chip was not build for USB 30
I guess next year iPhone 16 will have USB 30 as well  if they do not get a weaker nonPRO chip"
I waited to see if there was going to be anything radical but in the end Ill stick with my great 13 Pro best iPhone Ive had by far
I am preordering a 15 Pro Max on Friday Im excited for it
"how its not just usb c
its even 20
thats kind of expected to be just a quici refresh and usb with new software features but 20 dang"
Apple losing  being  jerk for too long nah never again
I dont think were gonna see the resident evil ports anytime soon look what happened with the m2 MacBook gaming premise
They use usb 2 in 15  usb 3 in pro It came out in 2007 
duo charger is been scrapped also the mini battery pack 
Camp dont care at all Ill wait for Samsungs new phones in January
Lol no fast charging  People still buy this stuff
We can call this the compliance generation
Note USB 20 is a standard from the year 2000 while USB 30 is from 2008 Apple is so far behind and fanboys are so clueless
O hate having to carry a Lightning cable all my gear uses type c and I often forget the lightning but Im not sure the rest of the features justifies the upgrade as Im using a 14 pro Ill wait for the full review P
Am i only the one who felt Marques voice kinda bad in this video 
Love your honesty and analysis youre not acting like the marketing department for Apple like iJustine and others
"Lightning is actually a more robust socket on the business end Id much rather replace my wire than my phone due to a broken tab

Edit second remark The phone is already heavy the Ti rails dont change that much For me if the phone is heavy just go all in and keep the stainless steel The Ti rails would make sense if the phone was meant to be light like the Grand Seiko snowflake watch"
Android lovers here
800 phone with 60hz screens meanwhile android phones have 90120 at 300we the buyers are to blame here
Dude apple still didnt add a pen on a phone which means samsung still wins with qualcomm
It looks like iphone 
Who cares We use wireless charger now LOL
lets talk about the elephant in the room no 120hz on base models in 2024 rly
Yep not just USBC but old one 20  480 mbs like lightning
dULL
bored after 2 minutes maybe they should skip the new release all together until theres something new to release 
The so called favorite feature of yours The Action button exists on Pixel in a far better way which is Double Tap on the back of the phone What is exactly innovative here
Is the product Red discontinued
Its turning into an android
Marquee is sour because he didnt get a phone prerelease this time
Can someone give me reasons to take the natural Titan over the white one on the Pro Max
APPLE IS ANTICONSUMER
Looks like a Fair to assume they arent repairable friendly either and parts are still serial coded Dope review as usual
I can totally agree upon your perspective of fast charging but what about the iPhone 16 then  Clearly theyre saving it for the 16  the USB 32 gen2 speeds or thunderbolt speeds on the 16 pro roster 
No Touch ID  Bad Phone
Unfortunately still in camp dont care I used to get excited about new iPhone release events Since 5G iPhones became a thing I really havent seen much of anything to get excited about Year to year updates are so incremental that its nearly impossible to separate one phone from another Really wanted to find a good reason to upgrade but my current iPhone 12 Pro Max stills works like new Battery life may be down a bit but just gonna ride it into 2024
"Sorry to say but you are very wrong about titanium being stronger than stainless steel There is a common misconception that it 
has more tensile strength but this depends on the treatment of the steel and if you are comparing equivalent diameter or equivalent weight Stainless steel is almost twice as hard and so twice as resistant to scratches and deformities from drops Grade 5 titanium is harder than grade 2 titanium but is still a long way behind stainless for toughness I would say that titaniums big advantages are its light weight and its appearance I have a titanium watch which is much darker and in my view much more visually interesting than any of my stainless steel watches but it has far more scratches and dings from day to day wear So think about how hard you treat your phone and how many scratches you would be happy to live with before you decide the titanium frame is the one for you"
Everybody knew it will be meh as usual yet everybody showed up 
Its 2023 still 60 hz for iphone 15
USB 2 in 2023 for a 900 device What can I say What do you say
IF Marques can here me out please do tell apple to look up the overall phone industry how new innovative new design apart from the signature iphones this year is Big NO  NO MAJOR CHANGE  NO COSMETIC CHANGE JUST FEATURES  Hardly it matters to all im still happy with my iphone 12pro max nd 14
If they include fast charger with the pro varient It works have been the perfect phone to switch from Android to Apple But only time will tell if its a good phone or not
"The only reason his channel grew was because his parents are wealthy and bought him all those devices so he could review them on his channel

How many kids that have parents that work a 9 to 5 job buy their kid so many expensive electronic devices just so he can make video reviews and upload them to YouTube

He is only became successful because of his parents money"

Its interesting how hot it gets during the gaming
What about the direct to drive filming
The replaceable backpiece is awesome If you broke the previous models backglass youd either have to get the phone replaced on insurance or buy a new phone  if you wanted to get it fixed
I was about to watch the APPLE EVENT then I thoughtIll just watch tha guy who says Mkibidiheightchere
Could we theoretically map the new button to launch google assistant
USB 20 on a new iPhone is simply spitting in the faces of their customers Im sticking with my Pixel phone dude
I cant wait to see what happens when their devices have to have user swappable batteries again Theyll probably claim they did it for the customer too and pretend its an innovation as if we didnt have it a decade ago in phones let alone other devices The screens sizes chips and so on wont impact us much over the next few years but the right to repair movement and standardisation will bring genuine quality of life improvements I loved how they referred to the phone being easier to repair as if they had a choice on that as well
So boring  Apple 
Its always behind other android phones
"Its the same smartphone same shit same everything  The only new thing is what has already existed on Android smartphones for over 5 years USB type C

 Congratulations Apple you can sell an insignificant piece of paper for 1000usd congratulations"
Typical Apple relationship with Apple fanboys Apple announces theyll FINALLY be using a piece of tech USB C thats been available for years and all the fanboys lose their minds But in typical Apple fashion they find a way to limit that tech and only make its full potential available on the most expensive version Theyre just so scummy
Does this mean that they will finally  FINALLY  allow you to toggle silent mode via shortcuts Ive been waiting for this feature for so long 
Less Wonderlust more Lacklustre
I cant justify spending money to go from my 14 pro max to next years model 
How ipocrit can someone be not to see is the same f phone from last year  i was planing to uprade my 12 pro max to a 15 pro max but definitely not doing that  the only reason i dont switch to samsung is because of the watch and airpods  this is a f joke
Apple simply hires you tubers and wallah They are singing the same song as captn cook 
I am in camp dont have the money to but it 
Disappointed for not having fast charging but hey it is what it is 
To be honest We just have to it that Apple is now behind in Innovation Theres no reason why anyone should be buying iPhone instead of Samsung and Huawei
914 this is probably the only feature that impresses me with the new iPhone 15 its amazing how you can hold it down and you can switch to the accessories quickly
You might be remember about action is not the only one features apple iphone 15 exclusive you can do that on android phone and that is samsung phone which a few year have that with name side button can do more switch every you want it such launch camera turn on flashlight and more
I love Anker products Real quality I think i had one power bank for like 7 years It was still working but looked shitty so thats the only reason i upgraded of course to another Anker bank
"Apples CEO is HAPPY
iPhone 14  UCB C  iPhone 15"
No fast charging No comment
Where is the third party apps sideloading
USB C is old technology now and Apple managed to make it new again because they are so slow 
No fast charging is a ruddy joke
Did they give you the ability to independently change the volume of ringtone and alarm yet Or did they just continue to ignore a basic feature like always
Thank you for the content Congrats on Apple quoting MKBHD Im still using my iPhone 12 Pro Max and was curious on what Wonderlust would show 15 Pro model is my fav but 15 Pro max stands out still I may wait on the 16 and hope its not a bump unless my current driver decides to crash Good vibes your way and to the rest of the staff
I still feel like the 14 pro max was the big jump last year
30 years in IT and not a single Appl product bought
its really funny that we are paying 2800 dolars for the same device that is being sold on 1200 dolars just because our government wants 2 more phone to himself
There is zero wow factor in 15 comparing with my 14 PM  For non pro users may be a update
Guys i need a question answered isnt the Type c port a bad idea here me out what if someone grabs a hold of your phone and straight up bends and snaps the centre bit that is in the center of the port itself that means you wont be able ti charge it
Im still using iphone xs which luckily still covered by ios 17 updates But iphone 15 promax RE console games compatibility and great camera may entice me to upgrade 
The 15 Pro and Pro Max are great and amazing but not for me 15 Plus is just perfect phone now is time for upgrade from my iPhone Xr 
Yeah nah Ill wait for the 16 Pro
Huawei played very smartly and developed their own Protection Glass Kunlun Glass thats 10 Times stronger and Crack proof than the competition While Samsung and Apple spending Billions of dollars to the sides material Most of the time display breaks that should be protected well not the sides
USB 20 on an iPhone is just unacceptable And still no fast charging
Camp DONT CARE AT ALL
Who is here that cant afford but watch the videos 
Are basic 15s have 120hz display now or thay still have crappy 60hz screens like previous basic models
Everything in the universe is either a duck or not a duck
Im an Apple user but clearly I can see that these phones are just iPhone 14 pro S series 
Its totally not worth it if you have an iphone 14 but im still buying it
The whole gatekeeping USB3 behind the pro models just smacks of trying to nickle and dime the customers Very much not a fan of that as someone who doesnt use iCloud at all and regularly hard wires his phone to his PC
"Tim Cook It is USBc but slower
Fanboys They did it again Innovation as its best"
think im gonna get the pro charging my phone macbook and ps5 controller w the same cord is peak
I went with iphone 11 pro to 12 because of one thing Wireless Charging aka magsafe It makes life alot easier without having to use cables to charge as im always in a car with magsafe or at home with my belkin 3in1
The fast charging uuuhhg And you know its coming next year
Are you sponsored by apple or something the phone was shit this year
Super boringbetter wait for iPhone 20
iPhone 12 vs iPhone 15 spot the difference minimal Is it worth spending 1500 minimum The last 5 years or so weve really been spending thousands to get a slightly better resolution or a slightly better processor or camera but in reality the difference is minuscule Funnily though Apple are not dumb they are deliberately late to the USBC community so everyone spends the next 58 years transitioning across to everything USBC and by that stage there will be new technology
Nice autotrader shirt
What do you think is it worth to change iphone 13 pro max to iphone 15 plus
wider to 24mm equiv and the 12x gets you back to 28mm how it always was and then they also added 15x to get to 35mm a very
I like MBs reviews Simple to the point
Focus and depth control 
Im waiting for Iphone 18 Pro Plus Vibranium Adamantium Max
I got somewhat excited to change my galaxy s21 to the new iPhone When seeing what they are offering I think I wont make the change Even on the Ultra im assuming that the usb 3 is 30 not even 31 or further This is 2013 tech on a 2023 phone
Setting that to an Apple Pay shortcut
wow such revolutionary invention usb c charging wow wow wow
iPhone 15  same same iPhone 14  Nothing new innovation is dead at Apple Poor generation of clueless hipsters now what are you going to stand in line for like zombies
What are the genuine innovations here If the 15 is really just a sprucedup 14 then were looking at a 13ss in disguise Theyve added a new image sensor but thats only for the basic model What else And sure the Pro sensors got a boost but is that it That new port Most of us are just walking by Every year theres a new chip Yes its upgraded and yes it does something more but its almost routine now The only excitement Keeping the same price for the same storage Finally Something sensible But the hype about a new button on a phone Seriously The presentation is a lot of flash little substance And as for titanium We had steel before Hardly the gamechanger theyre making it out to be Theyre still solid phones but I question the grand show for what feels like mere crumbs to the average user
Im liking the USB C for the Pro models for the recording directly to my mini storage drives And of course for travel  now a single cable for everything
Classic mkbhd
What type of display is it
Worth it but only if I can sell my 14 Pro Max at minimal loss It is in mint condition
Nah these new phones aint IT
They got rid of Leather replacing it with Fine Woven What a shame I always liked Apple Leather
The action button is practically useless if it cannot handle being used for putting the phone on silent and doing other actions simultaneously through maybe holding clicking double clicking or triple clicking the button
What I was expecting you to talk about was the recording to a external device
Sometimes I ask myself how much we really  need in a phone I mean really my phone has al kinds of gadgets  and tricks I dont know half of them 
Its shit that I have to have a lightning to keep using my Beats Solo Pro 
Im a proud Samsung fanboy but I cant wait to buy my wife the iPhone 15 pro so I dont have to waste another second fetching a darn lightning cable anymore Gonna have a bonfire for all the lightning cables I can find in the house 
Me watching on a midrange android phone knowing wont be able to buy it 
Apple is basically the Ubisoft of Electronics
It now has USBC Whoa big deal Not even fast charging xD
No one talks enough about Apples new Spacial video recording Im curious to know how they do it
Apple is the biggest scam of the century
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra from 2020 has 5 X Zoom
I love a custom action button Its just so convenient
This has not been mentioned  but to take advantage of the thunderbolt data transfer the apple cable is 75it should have been included with the Pro phones as per the rumours but typical of Apple they are charging extra for it 
At first I was underwhelmed by the action button But when I think about it I never use the current switch anyway My phone is always on silent and I use my Apple Watch when I want notifications with sound So the action button now actually allows me to use it everyday For example I use focus modes a lot and could bind it to quickly DnD my devices when needed
By making the back glass etchedfrosted on the non Pros theyre also making those slippery little critters like the Pros The only bit that my hand grips to on my Pro is the shiny able logo  I didnt put it in a case to protect it I put it in a case because its so slippery
There is no Professional in the word Pro Its a bit misleading Never in a professional shooting have I ever seen someone pull out their iPhone and goWait I shoot it with my iPhone
Same phone same shit
Incredible they cutted characteristics between pro and pro max 
I ask againWheres the innovation Please dont tell me about cameras and the side button Please dont
"Things that need to improve in 2023 phone
Camera
Battery

Things that are already there and still ok
Design

And most important to improve is
Internet speed from service provider

what are the screens and refresh rates like compared to the older models
Just letting you know that iPhone 15 plus costs around 999  1200 and it still has 60 hz display and last years A16 bionic chip
I am so not hyped for this years iphone Yeah Usb Cfinallyit took long enough The iphones are more like androids from 2020
Does not seem like I need to update from my 13 pro max yet Year after year it is the same meme a big event to merely cover a tiny bit of update Conspiracy theorists might be right in regards to corporate greed the big companies might have tech that would have us scratch our heads but are hiding them to get as much profit as possible from tiny improvements on the current tech If you think about it at this point recycling is optimized Little changes to current phones means small changes to established factories to implement new features More money generated from devices already purchased and being recycled Before someone comments on RD they better think twice about the new features
yea dont care at all probably cause i have an iphone 14 i use both my android and iphone almost 5050 that i pretty much can use both at the same pace in auto pilot mode and yea the iphone 15 line up is not enticing if they had iphone 13 mini in stock in my region i would have gotten that phone instead because i actually like the smaller phone size i would be interested if they had iphone 15 mini
I wonder if the action button will act like the AssistiveTouch button Where are you can program a different action based on how long you hold down the button With the AssistiveTouch I can have one action if I hold it down for one second and I can have a different action if I hold it down for two seconds or even half a second
In times of uncertainty investing in stable industries is key Explore the evergrowing medical cannabis market with Cannafarm Ltd
It annoys me that people are downplaying the fact that Apple locked usb 3 speeds behind the Pro model paywall Ive seen FAR cheaper phones deliver that transfer speed Its a slap in the face from Apple and extremely deliberate
Are cryptocurrency and business incompatible I think youre not keeping up with the news While you thought it was impossible some enthusiasts from Cannafarm Ltd integrated cryptocurrency into the production of medical cannabis What do you say now
So many smartasses here I see everyone knows about crypto but nobody made money on it like I did  thanks to Cannafarm Ltd
Not all investment platforms offer the level of security that Cannafarm Ltd does Experience their rigorous standards and enjoy peace of mind
Forget about all the cryptocurrency hype If you want real profits consider investing in the booming medical cannabis industry with Cannafarm Ltd
Here we go again market analysis in circles Finally Bitcoin moved but nothing grows like the plants in Cannafarm Ltd they can bring profit thats the real deal
Ditch the volatile crypto market and focus on realworld investments Discover the potential of Cannafarm Ltd in the medical cannabis sector
Learn from the mistakes of others who have lost money in cryptocurrencies Invest in a tangible and growing business like Cannafarm Ltd
Soooo its the same as the previous iphones but got a USBC that they advertise as a step up even though EU regulations forced them to do it Nice
Wait do you think cryptocurrency will crash I dont think so More and more companies are integrating cryptocurrency into their operations Amazon Cannafarm Ltd Burger King even Starbucks dude
I dont get the point of discussing ICOs or cryptocurrency arbitrage when theres an opportunity to invest in the medical cannabus industry with Cannafarm Ltd It skyrocketed after the pandemic
The geniuslinks are not working
another yeah another iphone that millions of sheep are going to BAAAAAaaa
Any idea if we can charge while recording video to an external drive
Im Going Back to Analog  Fcuk ThatIts Not Worth It Its 2023 HellO
Somebody should make a comparison between the way the iPhone 15s way of capturing photo information to be able to change the focus point after the fact and the way Lytro cameras worked when they were released
Midrange Android got better phones than that overprized iphone 15
Samsung and android have to do something about animations and speed too on their phones as apple is miles ahead when it comes to this
"Dear future iPhone 15pro users
If you ever have any questions on how to use your shinning new features ask an android user weve had them for years"
Youre missing the point with the focal length switching  its not got to do with using specifically 12x or 145x or something like that which are relative to the lens of the phone but rather the 28m 35mm which are standard focal lengths for photography A lot of portraiture street photography is done at these focal lengths to its handy to have them quickly within reach especially since Apple seems to be trying to cross the bridge into pro production with these phones
"Although this isnt a big change this Iphone might benefit me as an android user 
1 i can finally buy multicharging cables that dont feature a useless lightning cable
2 I can finally ask iphone users to borrow their chargers
3 there will be a new wave of crazy viral videos because people will be able to have their cameras ready faster insane car crashes explosions fights etc 
4 this will finally get rid of accessories with MicroUSB I hate buying new technology that still charges with MicroUSB  I can see why people still use it its cheaper to produce and it makes sense for accessories in the 5 to 20 range but now manufacturers will have a new reason to completely switch to USBC because that simple switch will make their products more appealing to apple users 
5 I might finally buy an iphone I currently have 2 androids and have been considering switching one for an iphone Mainly for its camera Usbc on the iphone might be the thing that finally pushes me to get it improved zoom cheaper repairs and the custom button are a nice bonus"
This video should be titles as   reasons why you should not buy an iphone 15 pro if you already have 14 pro or pro max
It basically is just USB C
"Sad to see that the biggest tech company is coming out with such small incremental upgrades No major innovations on both the iPhone  watch from a bunch of very highly paid employees 
Apple needs to do more in my opinion "
I can do the next gen portrait mode on my Google pixel 7
"It seems like an obvious theory to me that the 16 or 17Plus will upgrade to USB 3 and the 16 or 17 ProMax will upgrade to Thunderbolt

Keep everything incremental and theres always a reason to go Pro over standard and a boost to standard at the same time"
well the USBC was unavoidable given that the EU has decided that only USBC electronic devices will be allowed to be sold in the EU so Apple had to kneel and stop charging overprice for their exclusive cables so its not that Apple decided to go USBC it was that if they didnt goodbye to the EU market
"You just know that if Samsung brought out the ultra that was THIS similar to previous gen without faster charging or any real major improvements that youd drag it through the mud 
Not to mention the title would be in a negative light"
"Im a android user so this is going to be slightly bias 
I wasnt impressed with the iPhone 15 Most of what they show android has had Which i know thats nothing new But from a realistic sound point most people are gonna put a case on their phone so it being titanium seems gimmicky The camera overhaul seems cool i guess If im being honest i thought the watches were actually pretty interesting than the phone"
Still waiting for them to bring touch ID back to iPhone
The exact same phone essentially apple really do just be milking their products
Its crazy to me how iphones are still about 34 years behind in tech and people are still excited for them No fast charging No reverse wireless charging Oh but wait  they have imessage
48mp on 15 is really a good decision hopefully better low light photography
I think Apple are really good a trickling out new features and tech so quick charge could be next year or no charging port
I think the fast charging was intentional due to fast charging will reduce the battery life you are pumping more amps with the same voltage so it will get hotter Since apple has a major issues with batteries on the 14 or 14 pro i didnt expect them to implement any fast charging on this one either I would like to have the option of fastcharging even though i would not use it but it would have been very bad PR from people that use it and one month later see the battery health decreesing
Just because of that button on the side Ill upgrade my iPhone 14 to a 15
"Why stuck with 20 watt why so one cant call them updated in all areas may be in next 23 years

Very much apple is behind in this area but they dont care  customers about it"
Now youre android friends can steal your apple charger i dont see the new action button lasting similar to the touchbar The action button is literally your pull up menu And I dont see apple making ALL devices usbc I think itll be on the newest models Some folks dont care about all our wires being the same
I think that it will be very useful to create a video like iPhone 14 pro VS iPhone 15 Since they now just repack the last year pro to create this year base model It will be useful to see is it better to buy last year pro or this year base just a thought 
Apple are the WORST lol no fast charging i message sucks and there is more crappy features  but i am half asleep here lol
I cant afford an iPhone yet but been following its releases will just say I am interested in changes that they will implement next year nothing ground breaking from them this year
I like your point on the titanium frame titanium is nice but Ive never heard of somebody saying oh no I cracked my frame at this point the titanium frame is just hoopla
Now just waiting for Marques to do a Huawei mate 60 pro  now that will be a great review to see as it dropped before the iPhone
Thanks European Union for USBC
USBC on an iPhone means that it is snowing in hell right
The fact that you can put back etc buttons on android is its one of the pros that makes phone usage simpler for people especially older ones
all that camera hardware just to be destroyed by apple processing without the ability to turn it off
Is the low thermal conductivity of titanium not affecting heat dissipation when playing games on the iPhone
I think Ill wait until x5 zoom will be available in iPhone 16 Pro 61 Anyway I usually skip 23 iPhoneMacBook generations
They didnt include fast charging because theyll save it for another phone coming up Then claim its innovative
Not an upgrade much seriously Good I will save my money and upgrade from my 12 pro to a 14 pro max cheaper
I was just waiting for you to talk about Apple quoting you Whats your take on that
So its the same phone just a new plug in port
apple can NEVER make an all round good phone either they fill it with jargon new features that have been on other phones for years and then proceed to make it comically over priced for what you get or they limit data speeds and refresh rates for no reason other than to make the cheaper phones seem inferior all just a massive money grab
"Man i was Waiting on ure video 
Biggest fan "
Totally disappointed in the lack of faster charging and no Thunderbolt speeds However if they fixed the iPhone 14 cameras it may be worth it I hate the 14pros camera My old non pro 13 took much nicer photos for my needs Would also be great to see them give manual lane control to the user in the magnifier app  I use it a lot and my god is it frustrating to have it automatically change to a different lens right as Im about to take the picture
Wifi 6 to your NAS is good enough
Not worth it but I have to have it 
"Another year another IPhone with a 60 hz screen
What a joke of an upgrade
But people will still buy it only because of the brand "
Oh my Steve Jobs would be so disappointed about Apple today Lazy video presentation of a lazy upgrade of a lazy upgrade of a lazy upgrade of a lazy upgradeGreat phone but my iphone X is still working great I wait vor the Honor Magic V2 to show up in my country  will be the first time for me to leave the Apple ecosystem since 2011
Imagine when Warzone mobile comes out in 2 more months many people will buy this
Im finally thinking about transitioning from android I was kinda expecting more from the 15Pro question is is it worth it
Iphone is bullshit for universal
I appreciate your efforts to justify the need for the new iPhone but sorry hype is over They emphasize the typec because nothing else is worth buying it for the current users I cannot believe the comments trying to support MKBHDs justification lol They are so optimistic that it is going beyond cringe level
Its crazy how you missed the spatial video feature for the pro iPhones  I woulda thought that stood out more Either way Im going base plus model for the first time seems to have everything I want
"Finally typec on a iPhone Yay 1515 typec 20 and 15 pro 15 pro max 30  Nice

Wait a minute  So this means  iPhone 16 or 17 will be typec 30 and 16 or 17 pro series will be tbolt  I dont even know anymore with Apple and their crazy ideas  15 Pro series looks good Ill admit but the 15 series might as well get last years 14 pro series  Better specs  Just my imo"
none of samsung or google flagships have a usb 2 port Even googles A series and Samsungs FE series have usb 3 its not about how many people will notice it but getting the best when youre paying so much
The question is whether to get iPhone 15 Pro Max or save for Apple Vision Pro 
Total waste of money if you purchase iphone 15 infact purchase s23ultra which is more creative and cheaper than these nonsense phones
IPhone Finally enjoying Samsung Has Had for years 
they wont give fast charging this year they will do it next year so they will still sell iphones next year see apple loves money
iPhone 15 steals the show Theres now not much reason at all to get a pro unless youre one of a few key personas
idk wt Apple is doing with all this money and engineers and they still produce same thing every year
60hz for a high end Smartphone is just a joke
"Nice phone I think the whole titanium thing is apples new favourite material to use all across the board lol But also it will add some protection to the screen in the sense that the previous steel frames when dropped would absorb impact well like a crumple zone on a car however that impact then puts pressure on the screen and if it doesnt crack immediately its almost inevitable that itll happen at the slightest drop next time These new titanium frames although less resistant to certain damages wont completely absorb it meaning the frame isnt pushed in to the screen but thats just my theory on it 

Great video as always no one does it like you man "
Useless update
Classic Apple offering solutions to problems they created themselves as improvements
yep getting one I always skip upgrades a few versions Now its time to get a new one
"In 1 year apple did nothing
Put a 5x zoom into one of the pro phone

So 100x zoom will come in the Iphone 20

These colors are joke
Why cant they make a normal black
All phones basicly grey

All the fuctions are the same

I really want to upgrafe to the 15 pro max cause the battery in the 14 pro is sht

I need to charge my phone 2x a day
But like this when the phone is basicly the same
Idk"
finally we can all share our chargers with each others
Wait until the iPhone 16 lineup 1st gen releases are always sub optimal
I cant understand how people still use iPhones Theyre like phones from 10 years ago The notch on the screen no fast charging usb2 speeds and so on How hilarious is this load your ear buds with a cable via your phone  I used to say those phones are good for older people because they are easy and just work But the same is true for years for android
Im sure HughJeffreys will be checking out that new repairability on the new Iphones ASAP
premium price for usb 20 and 60hz screen lol
Sticking with my 13 Pro for now but maan that Island thing is cool
This years lineup feels mid af like you said the big feature felt like it was usb c yet they were forced to do that and they did it in the most half ass kinda way
"Apple still making everyone buy the charging cable seperately because you should already have one despite it never being in an iPhone before 

Milking their mindless followers"
Is anyone out there excited about the new iPhones The most boring new models I can remember
iPhone is like the most boring product out there except that it has USBC now which makes it a little less boring perhaps
"Why the hell iPhone becoming an android 

The particular part of iPhone should be stay as it was I guess"
Same as the old one lol
Usb 20 is long gone should have atleast 30 not good
The new iPhones are totally trash Nothing has been improved  Do not waste your money  These iPhones are basically the same iPhone 13s
Sept 22
so basically they took the iphone 14 and 14 plus back glass feature to all the iphone 15 line up
Not worth to upgrade this year wait for next years 16 pro
Boring phone
"downfall of iphone and apple Moreover Apple has limited collaborations with local banks in India for convenient financing options and trading in a yearold iPhone at its store in the country typically yields only about onethird of its original value 603 on the 1767 iPhone 14 Pro anecdotally speaking

For careful Apple observers thats not surprising at all  Apple has treated India as a secondclass citizen for over a decade Even after paying a hefty price Apple customers in India will not get access to scores of services including News Fitness and Apple Pay

The Apple Card and its accompanying savings account feature in the US are also absent from the Indian market Apple Maps and Siri offer fewer features to Indian customers"
Crazy advancement in the iphone world something my phones have had for years and my laptop
This announcement was straight WHAAACK
Marvin Gaye sample in the intro Nice
if i would buy an iphone than definetly not the 15 lineup The 15 is just a recycled 14 that is a redesigned 13
MarkASS brownLEE
still 60Hz
"So USBC thats really the only new feature from the 12 13 and 14 pro to the 15 pro I dont feel as though this is an upgrade Im surprised no ones sued apple for obsolescence and environmental damage as each upgrade feels so incremental and outdated especially with usbc which has been around for years and yet theyre still holding back on the new 15 and 15 pro models in terms of charging and data transfers I hope they will change and give a product people are amazed by and give us actually new features 

I understand every year would be difficult to consistently give new features but as someone who uses a 12 pro looking at the 15 pro it doesnt look like an improvement Usbc is the only interesting feature and even then it required a court order Im not a photographer who will be using all the new camera features etc I rarely play App Store games as theyre all ad hubs compared to the golden age of angry birds doodle jump and temple run etc the button above the volume buttons you guessed it will still be the silence button as its the best button for work gym cinema etc with the cost of livinginflation Im keen to see how these phones will sell or will there be another iPhone XS case on their hands wring to investors"
Same shit really
Yeah we in the EU won big over Apple Thanks to us the usbc is now the charger on apple products Not that I  care I would never buy an apple product but still Im proud that we beat the giant
Are we gonna see reasonable price phone anytime by this company
347 hasnt that been on android for years at this point
USB C was such a headline that Apple forgot to update anything else At least thats what it seems like right now So until I see the camera improvements in an upcoming review in comparison to something like the iPhone 13 Pro it makes literally no sense whatsoever Apple is already so good theyre becoming complacent So unless fresh sales figures hopefully push them to start innovating again I think theyre gonna keep playing these games where they make something as dumb as a digital zoom a headline camera upgrade feature Most disappointing apple event in recent history
As a 14 Pro user the 15 Pro Max is tempting From what theyre saying A17 seems much more efficient the 5x camera is interesting at the very least titanium frame makes it kinda lighter USBC makes it so much more practical to use and charge and god with the battery life im getting right now I wish I had gone with a 67 model to begin with
Im on 13 Pro Max currently will not be upgrading to 15 Pro Max Ill see what comes next year
One of the most hyped up releases
So iphone 13 and 14 are not getting usbc
Big part of using USBC is just restriction made by EU that says since 2024 all phones sold in EU must have USBC charger Sadly this change seems like biggest benefit on this new phone
USBC the one ring to unite them all
Basically nothing very interesting but all welcome stuff especially USB C Just a refinement of an already solid product The only things Id ask for are 5x optical zoom tech in the smaller Pro model as well and at least 90Hz screen on the nonPro iPhones
Woth upgrading my 6s to the 15PROmax or wait till next year
Kinda expected that MKBHD was gonna be quoted in one of these events And voil Hes one if not of the best around The last and only iPhone I had was a 4s and I kinda remember that the first iPhone he reviewed was the 5s I am on the camp waiting for reviews and see if its worth buying This is a new generation of iPhones touting the USBC Looking forward to it
Why no 120hz on the iphone 15 
"Ill stick with my iPhone 14 Pro Max 1TB

Ill upgrade when Apple offers a 2TB option"
Marques is GOATED when it comes to tech Youtube
who cares
Meh Ill have to buy a new iPhone sooner or later I guess it would be good to buy the latest model But I will use about 5 of the features that are available Making phone calls and sending text messages is what Im about
15 promax and the 14 Pro Max both have the same exact brightness levels Theres no difference
Apple just made a Galaxy S8
Ugh AnkerStill not going to buy any Anker stuff They showed their marketing claims cannot be trusted via their Eufy brand to a dangerous degree and that they wont even do the right thing when caught
I hate the iPhones design but Im just too potcommited to its ecosystem I wish I could use an Android phone with iOs Couldnt care less about the USBC port either As long as it charges quick enough Next to that I have to admit that Im getting older and older Dont use the camera as much as I used to I use it to scan documents Long story short this is a big letdown again
Quick one I have noticed that with these big videos so to say Marques and Mr whose the boss maybe others too upload at the same time Is there some coordination happening 
So still no Head phone jack OMG this super new one thing called Minijack is very matchable with Iphone apple plz
I swear Apple makes billions from addingchanging nothing And we always fall for it 
Get ready for the price hike in the EU 
basically they just change the charger from lightning to usb C BUT they give us more expensive phones which is all Apple thing I think if we dont care about charging port its still the 14
Also since when is 999 equal to 1199 in Europe I swear Apple is tripping
I love how he says I will ask Apple nonchalantly thats how you know you have made it if you can ask Apple a question and they answer you 
"Im kinda blown away that they put raytracing into a smartphone Its crazy
And based on how the market works well probably see Android flagships in the coming years with similar tech

Its kinda nice how they switched to USBC so soon but kind of a bummer that the base models dont get USB3 speeds and as mentioned
the Pro models shouldve gotten a Thunderbolt capable port"
Im in camp I still have an iPhone 11 and need to decide between an iPhone 15 Pro or Pixel unless the pixel wows the pants off me imma probably go iphone again
the change in TYPEC Cable is not a big deal its only big deal to those tech geeks we need CONVENIENCE and PRACTICALITY
If battery life is as good as they claim on Pro model Ill be sure to get one
I hope to upgrade my 13 pro max
Typical Apple then
One Question mkbhd  this next gen portrait will eventually replicate to iPhone 14 or iPhone 13 as its just a software thing or there is something hardware change as well Thanks in advance
What I like is the way Apple didnt announce the usbc like its a whole new innovation kinda thing
Can we just do new iPhones every two years
Out dated iphone 15  too late  Android way ahead
Was waiting for USBC upgrade so will be buying in the coming months
"are you going to just sideline ray tracing Dude its a huge huge huge deal Basically if they do it right in a couple of years they can kill console gaming
Iphone could natively play all major games coming up

Imagine how crazy that would be that appples first gaming device is an iphone"
Friends Android phone 
Bro ive been waiting for your post for the ip15
No iPhone Mini  
Finally now i have all the informations to NOT buy this shit
Great video 
"My iPhone 11 Pro Max has been battered like crazy and I only have about 70 or so left of usable screen Ive been using it like this for over half a year waiting for this new USBC lineup I figured it wouldnt make sense to get a Lightning iPhone as a replacement anymore if a USBC one is right around the corner Just cant decide now whether Id want to go with the Max or nonMax variant now but theres still some time to figure that out

What would be interesting with the action button is if you could change its setting with a Shortcut dynamically remapping it to something different on the fly eg in different focus modes"
watched this to confirm apple isnt doing much new with phones anymore
I dont get it He always point out the ecosystem thing it is a very positive thing whereas the competitors have features that doesnt work on there ecosystem and they failed after trying hard to create an ecosystem of their own
Apple moved to USBC because the EU forced them to do so
I am waiting for your review on huawei latest phone
USB20 speeds in a 2023 phone i have no words Love my iPhone but what a joke lol
Camp dont care at all sounds like if theres no real benefit of the USB c yet it just means pushing us into buying cables and charging accessories
We can figure out if these phones are actually worth it MKBHD is quoted in Apples keynote and he still tells it how it is without any fear of not being invited back to Apple iPhone party Gotta love this guy 
Need to figure out if its worth the jump from the 13 pro
Its pretty sad when the first 20 minutes of the video highlighting the new iPhone is a goddamn USBC port
Apple literally mentioned MKBHD when mentioning the Macbook Air 15 in the beginning of the iPhone 15 event
Apple will forever be in Samsungs shadow They eventuality use all the old Samsung tech and put a white stamp on it
the USBC is only there due to regulations in the EU forcing all manufacturers to produce devices with USBC ports for charging to reduce cable usages and wastage 
Why apple doesnt support aptx or ldac
USB 2 and USB 3 lol what a joke
Between this phone and the Pixel 8 Im feeling this year is NOT a good year to buy the latest phone
Thanks to the EU for forcing Apple to make USBC 
nothing new about the iphone except the USBC yep pretty much same home screen
"Love the video Marques and love the condensed overview but I was really hoping for you to talk about it running RE4 Remake  ReVillage natively 
I wanted to know how well it runs it seems like iPhone is getting to steam deck level"
I am only interested in the new LiDAR scanner
My jaw dropped seeing the USB C port I never saw Apple actually doing it They hated the idea
Fast charging was omitted on purpose so that some future iphone has something to upgrade to Meh
Alright Apple time for a foldable
What color would u say looks more better the new blue or the natural titanium color
I have the iPhone 13 my next upgrade wont be till 1718 model
"I think the next gen iphone apple will introduce really had just new color with faster cpu they cant do more
Come on apple your sluggishly progressing the entire focus was on the new titanium case and the weight reduction who cares about a phone that is light and really expensive with limited comparable features 
Really disappointed by this apple"
i have a 13 pro max and Im out of memory so i think i might be in for the 1 TB model
No 4K 120fps no thanks
413 After a long time i have heard marques say subscribemay be im wrong 
Samsung just knows where to show ads
Boring Apple Steve Jobs rolling in his Grave in the name of innovation
The giant camera hump and huge LENS sticking out  It needs a case for protection and balance out the phone so its not wobbly like the Samsung S 22S23 phones    The Pixel 68 having a Camera bar across the back means the phone is stable and more out of the way of fingers
I am on the 13 pro max and tbh nothing has driven me to want the newer iPhone models The improvements are only in small increments USB C is a nice to have but my Apple ecosystem is yet to make full use of it At the moment its more of a nicetohave If Apple releases a foldable that would be a definitive step up
Its funny to think that these features could be a Pro version of the 14 except for the USBC one but Apple just released an iPhone 12something again
I love how its the same USBC but Apple still found a way to segregate it between the normal and pro version Just like back when they took a monitor and sold it as 3 separate products 
Pretty happy with my Iphone 13 so far nothing overly new for these past 2 years
Iphone looks the similar to 14 
Still got the base 13 and still wondering if i really need an upgradeit would be nice to have but is it worth it
The reverse charging has been working for me even with lightning my iPad has become my favourite powerbank
The fact that the pro has hardware ray tracing and upsampling in a phone is just wow
The fact that ONLY the Pro models feature the 120hz display in 2023 is despicable
Would like to know if the new phones on ultra wide settings  will the pictures edge get distorted  fish eye
Apple did such a smart move next year they are going to launch iphone 16 with a17 not the a17 pro processor and make a clear distinction
I honestly think that Apple will be making another crazy profit from the switch to type c as they would sell new products which cater for the type c which will cost a crazy amount or sell a cable that allows for a transfer from a type c to a lightning cable
No battery upgrade
in the end people just use it for calling and social media Is there any significant change if you use A17 or A15 we are just fooled by the big tech company to buy the latest phone
I am unreasonably excited about the action button The double tap of the power button to open the camera is probably the Android feature Ive missed most on iPhone so having a dedicated button to open the camera now seems really nice Im just curious how ergonomic it will be to press but itll definitely be better than turning on the screen and swiping to the camera and completely missing the moment you wanted to capture
Not just USBC 20 year old 20
So the regular 15 still doesnt have a high refresh screen
"A17 PRO  fully binned produced now

A17  bad batches also produced now


3nm is a b Also no 10Gbs on A17"
No need to ask Apple if there was only space in the Max for that camera They literally said so on stage
Name of the instrumental in the intro 
Sick of apple doing the bare minimum and getting praised for it Android phones have so many more features Iphones are classy sure but idk its just not as exciting anymore
So after color iMacs Apple went back 20 years for iPhone when they launched Titanium PowerBook More and more I have this feeling that Tim Cook and the design team search among things done when Steve Jobs was alive and chose those they liked most
799 for a 60Hz screen in 2023 let that sink in
Comparison between Samsung Galaxy s23 ultra and iphone 15 pro
USBC is the most interesting new feature and only thanks to the EU That is  sad
Apple still need to add some software features to the iPhones We still dont have a full call history good luck finding that guy that called you 1 week ago with 100 calls list
"I cannot believe how many people incl Marques himself are downplaying the SIGNIFICANCE of switching to USBC It is a WIN for consumers over a greedy corporation And all of it is thanks to EU who actually care about its citizens
Also people dont understand what it means including a USB 20 if true in the year 2023 instead of USB 30 Basically Apple did the apple thing duped its consumers once again Congratulations"
"How many real end user actually need the power of 15  15pro  max
Is it worth the spend money of over powered things that you dont need
I dont think so
Im a heavy user and still using XR completely works fine for me every day at 79 battery health and still full day killing the phone at 10 at night with light usage
Ill prefer iPhone 13 or 13mini for my next upgrade"
The usbc port has to be implemented by the end of 2024 in Europe on all tablets laptops and phones so im guessing apple will apply this to all its products for next year
I mean  I  guess the new iPhone is what most people would want to upgrade to  if they have anything older than an iPhone 13  because honestly the changes are nice but not big enough yet It does open the doors for way better Iphones in the future Nice review as always tho
This is why influencers should not be the ones explaining these details
Apple the kind of Company to bring features that Phones have for 5 years and sell it as something new  and then overprice it and the cable also
tbh iPhone 15 has the most minor changes no one cares about Not enough to upgrade
I want an orange iphone and also so glad that he pronounced your name correctly bro i remember the old videos you had at first you really made it bro 
Ever since Tim Cook took over Apple stopped pushing the bar Theyve also stopped making the best product possible and this USBC 20 no fast charging is the latest evidence of this
The same phone just added a typec
"The USB 3 controller being part of the A17 chipset means that NEXT year when the base iPhones get this chipset they will also get USB 30 speeds At that point the 16 Pro iPhones will likely get either USB 31324 or even thunderbolt but they will definitely be a step ahead of the 16 base iPhones Very carefully managed separation between base and pro models

BTW I think that Apples full implementation of USBC will only arrive next year because that is when the EU regulation requiring USBC kicks in and Apple will simply not be able to sell in the EU unless they satisfy the regulators So I think this years deliberate crippling of USBC is kind of Apples F you to the EU regulators before they have to follow the rules in 2024"
Same phone as last year Since when innovation in tech became about BRUSHED TEXTURE or Material That  deserves 14s at the most not a new 15 number
I charge my iphone 13 with my mac charger and it doesnt take an hour to charge it Does anyone do the same or is it bad for the phone I read on apple website that you can do that
Hardly any justifiable reason to upgrade
Just skip to a 2 or 3 year cycle for phones Jesus
Most people buy the new iPhone to brag that they got the newest one As far as they Knowing this small changes they dont even care or know
3h 13 M views 
Currently got a 12 pro max and I thought to myself before the event that if the new phone is totally innovative Ill get it Ill be honest not wowed at all Although the natural titanium colour is nice
The apple event is the definition they are running out of ideas Literally everything they showcased it was recycled it didnt need an event it could have been a small PowerPoint or how about an EMAIL
Ive got a 13 pro and upgrading to the 15 pro max hope its worth it
Nice action button but no way to visibly tell if the mute is engaged short of turning on the screen  a significant loss of functionality especially if you need to quickly have a look at your phone while in a class court meeting etc and make sure your phone is on silent Cant believe they ditched the physically verifiable mute switch  a switch that unlike buttons was almost impossible to accidentally press while in your pocket or a case ends up putting pressure on the button Every iPhone since the first one had a dedicated and physically verifiable by looking at it ringsilent switch HUGE change not a happy camper Whats the alternative  have the phone in always on mode while in your pocket so you can quickly look at the screen without having to turn on the screen to verify silent mode
the keynote made the switch to USBC seem trivial it was barely a one liner introduction Shows they really did not want to have to do this
350 same shit every year same from iPhone
Basically there nothing to entice the average consumer not a techie You Tuber or photographer with a 14 pro  pro max to upgrade I suppose the question is how far back do you have to go to make the upgrade worthwhile for the average consumer  iPhone 11 12 13 or 14 is it now getting to the stage where there is no real advantage to upgrade not necessarily to the latest iPhone unless the one you have does not get the latest iOS version
Any idea whether its stopped doing the autotweak on photos  where you take a photo in the desired lighting etc then when the photo is taken and loads it suddenly boosts exposure and makes the photo looks grainywashed out etc Its infuriating
Wish I wasnt poor
Great video and thanks for the info
Silent button come back next upgrade
Im in camp dont play with my mute button 
Wowita so much to talk about this new 15 seriesiPhone is rather a status people carrying
"MARQUES framing is weird

The Pro features are literally never seen before and yet he says it is not that Starting from a 3nm SoC with 35 trillion operations per second machine learning engine to the brightest screen to the titanium alloy enclosure to 4K60FPS raw video to satellite services

Also the point of USB speed the chap is making is silly because most professionals will never use it anyway as WiFi is already super fast for file transfer

It is also weird that he is suggesting that Apple should lie that fastcharging can be only possible with USBC while it was perfectly possible with Lightning and the reason why Apple does not do it is to not kill the battery even faster than it is degrading

Also the chap does not understand the fact that the strength of titanium is needed to make the case thinner and even lighter it is not about the strength per se

Finally the idea that USB is the main feature is the stupidest yet The most strategic change is Apples entrance to the hardware ray tracing acceleration game It is already made several AAA gaming coming to iOS but this will surely shortly be followed by iPadOS visionOS and MacOS as the technology will be a part of M3 chips"
Therd one
The new IPhone 15 pro max is a thousands time better phone than Galaxy S23 Ultra
"I still was left with a question
 is there an easy battery replacement with this highereasier repairability


I was waiting on your review to check a few things Thank you for the clarity and level head you present on all your vids
My OnePlus alert slider is something really precious to me This new action button might be interesting but Sony had a dedicated action button for camera and others brands also had something similar but the specificity of the toggle and the quickness of it its something different

Thank you for sharing"
Camp Meh
Basically same phone as last year no better battery just a little be more zoom which is good but no really important and usb type C that didnt get faster charging I wont get it no even for half the price
"Ill wait for the iPhone 16 Max Pro Ultra Super Mega

iPhone 16 comes out

Ill wait until the iPhone 17 Super Duper Trooper

iPhone 17 comes out

Ill wait for the MyPhone18 S to come out"
The only reason I havent plugged in my iPhone for any other reason than charging is just because Im not about to buy accessories that plug into only one of our many devices Even ignoring the nonApple products every other Apple device we have has nothing to do with lightning and relies for some exclusively on USB C now anyway
nice reviewI am excited for iPhone 15 and Series 9 Apple Watch
Aw man now I need to lend out my USBC cable to those iPhone users
So the phone sucks but at least theyll get the Nobel Prize for Greenwashing Yay
So if the iphone 15 is connected to a PD 60W usbc charger will it possibly damage the battery because of too strong current
1k phone in 2023 with 20w fast charging and usb 20 iphone 15 plus with 480mpbs  pro model has 30 meanwhile samsung with usb 32  20gbps
Apple does a great job of presenting the same phone
NOT INTERESTED
This shows you can pass laws to stop companies being anticonsumer and creating huge amounts of ewaste Next is replaceable batteries
Yeah the new action button is cool But why the hell do we still have the same camera and flashlight shortcuts on the lock screen 
Hahahah they dont know how to design or what
Damn promoting Anker 
Ive got an 11 Pro Max so yeah definitely getting it
the phone that has tiny solar power that can charge a bit to sustain the power comsumption for few days would probvably would stand the best phone
Been with the Fold since Fold2 and dont think I could entertain ever switching back to Apple
Just bring back TouchID already ffs
How to order your apparel in India 
Double and triple tapping on the back of the phone when its set you can do the same as the side action button
By the time Apple has punch hole cameras iPhones Samsung already going to have under a display camera on the ultra
so there is nothing really new
"For me so far the problem with getting an iPhone is I like this phone but that feature that I would reeeealy appreciate will probably come out next year
Long story short I got a 14 Pro because my old phone died You get my point"
Is iPhone 15 has 90 hrz Anyone please ans
Not having fast charging is honestly a deal breaker when it comes to switching to ios for me
Got the iPhone 11 Nothing has impressed me that much to be able to justify upgrading let alone to buy copies with some new functions
The RND departments for many Android companies tend to work on unique things that they put into production ASAP think about how we had a galaxy edge and subsequent variants while Samsung figured out how to make a fully curved display In contrast Apple seems to develop a lot of features that they hold onto until it makes financial sense They absolutely have a capability to provide fast charging on their USBC but why add it in this years iPhone when people will fall over each other to praise Apple for it next year
Fast charging is coming to next years iphone as a major feature 
60hz on a 800 phone in 2023 i aint defending apple anymore and they just lost me as a 10 years long customer There is just no innovation anymore at all its just  a cash grab at this point never again I waited for 120hz on their base models since the 11 series With the 12 13 and 14 i was like okay fine but now yet another year without it no thanks
Does this mean that silent mode is no longer hardware and can be turned on off through siri This is nice
"Since maybe 10 years now ive been purchasing my iphones refurbished for max 300 Euro and could never understand how everybody always needed the newest one  
Now i will understand it even less

If the Apple Vision Pro doesnt become the next big thing  i dont see Apple growing much more in the next years"
Ar yes the same iphone which looked exactly the same as the one 5 yrs ago The software look like the same for the last 15 yrs
The most significant change for the new iPhones comes from the EU not Apple That says a lot about this years iPhones Not much to see here
removing the alert slider man what happened to iPhone and being unique
I mean yeah the 15 isnt that much of an upgrade but honestly having a few features from the pro model last year on this years base model is better than the 1314 jump 
Wow so they are using a transport Protocol outdated since 2008 but you have to pay 799 for that Shows how Genius Apple users are
I wish there was more talk about battery life I feel like it is one of the most important features for alot of people
they lowered the trade in value of the previous generation phone by around 150 compared to the last 34 years and most people who upgrade every year trade in their phone Thats equals to a huge price increase without putting it on the price tag This year will be the first time in 12 years Im not buying a new Iphone Sneaky business tactics
If you change the default behavior of the action button how do you switch between muted and ringer on
Honestly the iPhone 15 feels stall
Weird audio on this one
Not really compelling coming from a 13 Pro Max
Thank you Europe for forcing Apple to move to USBC
MARQUES IS THE GOAT IN THIS GAME 12 MILLION VIEWS IN 2 HOURS CRAZY LOVE FROM KENYA G  
Ive had an iPhone 12 pro max for three years My phone is pristine other than one tiny scratch that you have to work pretty hard to see on the front glass To be honest at this point if you break an iPhone you probably should be wearing a bib when youre eating I assume Samsungs flagship phone is similar If you break one of these phones you should probably go back to eating your crayons
Finally we have 60hz display and 20W charging for the iPhone 15 Oh wait 
I think the reason for the 12x camera setting is that they made the lens wider to 24mm equiv and the 12x gets you back to 28mm how it always was and then they also added 15x to get to 35mm a very popular focal length in photography introducing more and more photography lingo into the phone
Im on 13 Pro Max and I think I made the best decision back then to move to 13 Pro Max from iPhone X which I still use as well These upgrades dun look that impressive Im going to wait another year or even more
Just no in general Also the dynamic island is stupid
Such a comprehensively great product review
Titanium isnt stronger than steel Only per weight it is stronger
Thanks for EUs new regulation which makes our life more convenient and good for environment Apple is just too greed
A button is fundamentally inferior to a switch Customization could have happened without that physical change
Just getting so tired of the hype and then there is no leap While I am an Apple fan I am now certain that we are being totally manipulated and tricked by Apple but hey we all need a phone and I still love the design of the iPhone
Is 15 screen still 60Hz
I respect the fact that you keep it real about Apple products Other content creators tend to inflate the specs of iphones And yes I use iphones
The why for the USBC   By the end of 2024 all mobile phones tablets and cameras sold in the EU will have to be equipped with a USB TypeC charging port Apple is forced to 
Apple is so rich yet we havent seen any genuine innovations from this big company in years Every time i see a friend with an iPhone Ill try to guess which generation of iPhone it is as it hasnt evolved much throughout the years miss those exciting days when phones all look different with every launch and have new features each time
I loved when they quoted you about Mac Book Somehow I felt good too maybe coz Ive been following you since your inception
120hz have never been in the question all along
Apple said you could plug an external driver into the Pro model and the video will be DIRECTLY STORED in that external driver instead of the internal memory That could be a game changer for Content creators who just want to use only one device by the way
Once upon a time Apple displayed pride in being the first phones to include the newest certified specifications like Thunderbolt Building only USB 3 support into their 2023 chip instead of 32 or even USB4 feels like a low blow and that they are happier holding out on us nowadays
The pink onefor some reason looks like human skin
So Nothing new And usbc
You know the iphone has reached peak stagnation that USBC is the leading feature change if you ignore the software which isnt groundbreaking either The Titanium body is nice however bravo on that choice
USBC one cable to rule all
Wheres  the 3d camera mode with pro iphones  i was looking up to that
MKBHD Ive noticed your initial impressions of the iPhone 15 are quite positive Its interesting to compare that to your take on the latest Samsung foldable especially when both devices offer incremental updates rather than groundbreaking changes Would love to hear your thoughts on this
So a galaxy with extra steps
Looks like iPhones are the same since 2019
That later editing photos thing  was already on pixel right 
Finally I can buy an iPhone
Will these next gen portrait features come to 14 propro max Seems possible to do
I expect a lot when they say innovation but personally found none
no good reason  to upgrade to 15
im using iphone 12 pro and i think I will probably upgrade next year when iphone 16 comes out
What about AirPods Max Get they also USB C
Stick around for the EUs next W when companies are forced into removable batteries by 2027
Doesnt seem like its worth upgrading
Apple appears to have hit the limit on phone innovations
USB C barely matters if theyre not taking full advantage of it Most UnApple approach ever Theyre getting lazy and complacent This is the most blah update of an iPhone Just makes me want to fast forward a year so they can add what shouldve obviously been added this year
Pretty decent updates matched with the usual Apple half assed approach Still the HW is great on the Pro Max I would consider switching if it was bigger Too bad Apple doesnt make big screen phones or foldadbles
Supposedly wireless will be upgraded to 15 watt but its not certified yet When it is wireless charging will be released in an update
Well  Marq you forgot about wifi 6e which is in pro  pro max but not in base and plus  Kinda disappointing
Been waiting for this for a long time definitely getting the 15 pro max
Only apple fans can be excited about something as simple as having a usbc port 
"Other companies we have 4 colour options

Apple welcome to our pioneering new invention  colour infused glass"
"I can just imagine the Apple board meetings after the EU forced them to implement USBC  
You know what well just use USB 20 from 23 years ago The 10 year old USB 31 is obviously a Pro feature"
"Lmao hahaha usb 20 
My  galaxy s8 has usb 31 hahahaha  
I cant stop laughing 
This means No HDMI output "
"Lmao hahaha usb 20 
My  galaxy s8 has usb 31 hahahaha  
I cant stop laughing "
Trashnot getting it
Ive had alu and steel iPhone frames bent  distort over the years It reduces drop resistance and can give you water damage Titanium will do better there
Yeah new iPhones but how do you guys already have the GFX100ii which also was released yesterday 
I see absolutely 0 reasons to upgrade USBC is not an upgrade  theyre just enforced to change and who uses USB3 speeds on their phone anyway Cloud uploads are probably faster The chip in the 14 pro feels fast enough I have no idea why I would need 10 more speed 10 is not much either I think iPhone innovation and development is stalling rapidly and the upgrades become smaller every year
If it doesnt have a full frame camera sensor  Im not interested
I think that your reviews recently are unfair and just like an Apple fan who skips whats going on in the tech world all of these new updates in new iPhones were already available in the android phones for a couple of years and you are so hyped its new and innovative
Do the nonPro models now have the 14 Pro cameras ie Zoom range  Macro function
If Apple was so concerned about the environment I dont know why it took so long to convert iphone ports to USBC It makes sense that everyone is using the same charging cable
I really like the pink one
i like how he said comment section always open at the end unlike a certain company
Another year another iPhone which I could not afford
The worlds worst kept secret Im tempted to just upgrade my phone for the usb c its just my favorite thing from newer devices
I hate type c on iPhone i dont know why it feels like a fake
Just watched a Samsung ad
I want the pro but dont want the max and probably would have upgraded if the 15pro came with the 5x zoom Ill wait till next year
Disappointing as expected
same this same that
The blasphemy of finally kneeling down to change to usb c port type but not adhering to any of the latest usb 3 speeds in the non pro models is beyond disgusting It infuriates me that a 3 trillion dollar company is so much drowned in greed that they will find ways to squeeze money out of you Now being you have to buy a magsafe charger from them to have fast charging
"Why doe the Friend need to have android
Let him hold iPhone as well"
Apple iphone 15 vs Samsung S23
Nopewait for phone 20
Im in camp I could never afford it but Im watching anyway
camp dont care at all Will buy ipad pro instead
If A17 pro aint bleeding edge  read 3nm I dont know what is
747 PSA Dont drop your iPhone intentionally
The regular iphone 15 is still at 60Hz right
So whats new
Wow boring apple
Nah I will stick with the 14 pro max USB C is not going to convince me to upgrade The rest is mostly the same Performance will not be noted in everyday use and to be honest the 14 pro cameras are great The 5 x and fancy portrait mode alone is not enough to warrant an upgrade in my opinion
 752 what does stronger mean here If we are talking about denting when dropped stainless beats titanium in the hardness category Except maybe some exotic alloys but grade 5 is pretty basic stuff For the same bezel cross section a steel frame is sturdier than a titanium one when it comes to bending breaking and denting Titanium can produce a stronger frame if weight is kept the same as more titanium can be used It will be light tho but not stronger
He should be a CEO of Apple company 
Ill just wait for the 16 truthfuly there is nothing new 
The new USB C port also allows you to record ProRaw directly to external storage at 4K 60fps I guess thats a really neat feature 1323
Apple is doing what Samsung has done a long time ago
I just want someone to tell me if this is the iPhone that makes it worth switching from Android to Apple
Thanks a lot for the info
How much is your battery percentage 
Its funny to see mk get excited about usbc  
Waste of my money upgrading  to 15 pro max Thank you Markus
Time to upgrade from my 11
Now the Rob Jobs jokes makes sence
Lame Not compelling enough from my 13Pro
Brushed titanium Thats ASUS style I think itll feel old so fast
Kind of off topic but Ive been seeing a lot of tech ytubers talk about the phone and MKBHDs impressions of it just come off as far more genuine Hes not all flippy hype for the thing and yelling at the viewers Just genuine first impressions
My current iPhone is the XS Max so Im gonna get it Figured if Im going to get a new phone Im might as well get the one with USBC
Was bout to switch my 12 pro for the 14 pro but probably will try out the 15 pro
I am seeing samsung flip advertisement on apple video
A specific button that can be used for opening the camera app is really important Its not possible to use the touch screen when its raining heavily or in some below zero temperatures Sony has that button in all their phones and it works really well
Actually no one mentioned about apple watch 9 storage from s8 32gb up to s9 64gb
Apple fly yall out first class Ha 
Dont care iPhone 14 still great honestly lightning and usb doesnt bug me
Only 3000
Is iphone 15 base models screen 120Hz or still at 60  iPhone seriously has no innovation anymore all they have to do is a new camera feature and maaaaybe a little Chip improvement and thats it  nothing new  I had samsung A 71 for 4 years and last 3 months bought iphone 14 pro  Its great but upgrading yearly is very a stupid idea  Phones are at their peak time
God bless the EU to force apple to switch to USBC One of the best things theyve ever done
Can we connect directly ssd Via usb or have again restrictions
Ill wait for s24 ultra thanks for nothing
"I want to upgrade from my OnePlus 7 pro though works fantastic battery life is bad now plus I broke the screen 
I wanted to buy 15 but 60 hz sounds like deal breaker"
"mkbhd  Pls stop standing  in front of and besides a white screen  windows
The camera under exposes our dark skin 
You know better"
Colours look really boring to me 15 seems just right in spec as an upgrade for my 11 pro
60 hertz 
The accessories are already available L apple W android USB C is in power banks and almost everything else
"Been watching u for 12  years straight  thee only YouTuber that keeps to so real even the biggest of big
 Bow down"
I got my iPhone 12 in my hand and it works very well I dont see real reasons to change
next year every tech companies will change to usbd
I wish I could get one of these
"Apple Forcing us to use USB will hinder out innovation

EU You can innovate within the standard look at Thunderbolt

Apple then proceeds to make zero fucking innovations whatsoever with this port Just like they didnt for a decade with lightning Not even including USB3 on some devices and no fast charging is the real kicker You dont even need to include the charger The great innovators really showing their true colours"
Nothing of note about the new iPhones but lord knows Ill buy it if my iPhone11 Pro Max breaks
they use usb c not for the benefits but because they have to in the EU So its easier to have the same port worldwide Why they arent using the benefits is just an apple thing The iphone 17 is gonna have fast charging with 40W abd theyll announce it as a breakthrough
So longbeachgriffy videos on iPhones launch still hold true to this date
My man 
bro looks tired of apple
People dont realise how mature these products are How are they meant to make groundbreaking changes each year Why do humans always chase change for the sake of change
USBC IS NOT A FEATURE
Still using my iPhone X Which tbh is still perfectly fine the battery is still at 90 efficiency even after all this time Ok the camera is no where as good but if I want to take actual photos I use my Fuji so will see if I can last till the next iteration or the next
I think Apple has been helped by regulation to finally escape unscathed in changing an iPhone port making obsolete a lot of MFI devices that people had they wont suffer the same backlash they suffered when they introduced Lighting port  Its a good thing theyve dropped the 128GB on iPhone Pro Max but they should have removed it on all the phones while keeping them at the 128GB prices especially looking at how they didnt have to make a new SoC for the standard line Let people feel the savings
People used to line up over night to get the new iphone I see now why that doesnt happen anymore Minor updates
Why are the pro maxs not in pink
"Very Boring iPhone 15 pro max
Will switch to samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra"
USBC port does almost look the same as the lightning i bet 95 of the users wouldnt know until they try to plugin and then they probably starting to get that they now need to buy all the new cables xD
"They removed 3x n replace with 5x
Thats bad 3x is perfect for potrait shot they should have keep both 3x n 5x like samsung goving 3x n 10x optical"
I personally believe Apple pays for bots to comment on all of Marquess Apple video its always some weird comments about how they have been using a old iPhone and need to switch to the newer one the comments are scripted
This guys just unique 
"You know things are messed up when adding something as basic as a USBC port is somehow headline news 

People are brainwashed"
So basically anyone still choosing iphone  just have blind loyalty its not about tech advantage or a stronger phone lol the S23 ultra is better than iphone 15pro
I compared pixel size numbers they advertised in this and the last year presentation And it seems like sensor size in the 15Pro is the exactly the same as in the 14Pro But 15 has a smaller sensor than in 14Pro and 15Pro
Im getting the pro max for sure Im excited Im upgrading from the 12 and I had it for over 2 years now
Im done with iPhone No more home button no more aux 35mm jack Fine now no more Touch ID  I hate Face ID Now theyre getting rid of the silence switch NO THANKS
Sounds a lot to me like its just USBC Like Theyve settled
Thanks goodness for the EU
"600  They said that you can directly record to an external drive so transfer times arent that important as theyre limited to your external drive

825  does the more repairable back glass only apple to the pro model"
Ill wait to buy a refurbished iPhone 16 Pro Max for half price in a couple years
That event is Lackluster 
Wow I cant believe even the Apple fanboys are not happy with the new launch I thought they would love anything Apple put out no matter how overpriced or underwhelming it was But I guess even they have their limits
Why NO Touch ID fingerprint sensor  Dont you get sick of looking at your own face 10times a day  Yeah Bring back touch ID 
"Satin glass back  Google Pixel 4   USB C  Pixel 3  Were up to Pixel 8  in a few weeks  Pixel has had portrait mode since at least Pixel 4 

The colors look good especially the Navy   Hopefully it is easier to repair"
"The average iPhone user Man I need to go buy an iPhone charger

Me Wanna borrow mine for right now

TAIU Huh  You have Android I need an iPhone charger

Me Theyre both USBC

TAIU Idk what that is

Me Its the same kinda charger for both

TAIU And that wont damage my phone  Cuz I have an iPhone not an android

Me   Quietly to myself Just go drive yourself off a bridge somewhere"
I wish they had the mini still going its hard to switch to these big bulky sizes after the mini
So were not gonna talk about Apple mentioning Marques in the first minute of the Event
Its 2 civilizations AppleWest Samsungone plus  East People can choose which ever suits them
Cant wait for the 16 mini
"The fact i pay the same  for an Iphone 15 Pro Max 512 as ive payed for my 11 Pro Max 512 in 2019 is kinda mindblowing to me 
The fact i still cant fast andor reverse wireless charge with an Iphone  is embarrassing on the other hand"
"I dont get it I use normal charging for my Note 10 and after 4 years its battery is still going strong compared to my brothers note 20 ultra 
I charge mine to 85 too and it lasts me the whole day Rarely drops bellow 20"
basically dont update if you have the 12 or later
I like that its finally with USBC Now I can ask for charger from android friends
LTT aint got nothing on that segway to your sponsor
iPhones man  the amount of people that get duped every year is hilarious Type c And a button on the side  Jesus Christ Whats next year Another button on the other side that instantly gos to your camera    this year with iPhone 16 we know you love photos Thats why we incorporated with the brilliant minds at Apple  the all new  dynamic cambutt  button pressing the cambutt will instantly take you into the action of iPhone new 100 million mp cam instantly coming 2025 1300  the watchs  you literally being sold a iPhone thats getting bigger and bigger on your wrist   whats after that  The new Apple wedding  Iring Which tracks your fitness and can send vibration kisses to the ones you love with built in Apple tag to track the ones you love  honest to god Apple man you guys need to wake up
Lately I can really feel MKBHD getting frustrated over how smartphones maker make an obvious compromise on their phones They could have done better more ambitious more effort but they always leave an obvious improvement for later model Like they can install the improvement for this years model for sure but they are like nah save it for next years model That will be a selling point likethis scheme is getting too ridiculously prevalent and MKBHD has had enough of these bullshits I think
455 Marques casually glossing over the fact that a phone half the size of the Steam Deck can now run new triple A console games natively
Your friends Android phone huhh 
Why no RED iPhone
lmao usb3 moudles in the a17pro
YES now i dont have to buy their mid chargers
Im quite dissapointed they have removed the mute switch Being able to visually check if its on or not Or feel if its on or not in your pocket was really helpful and tactile
"Same old story portrait magic where it exist in android since a while ago Forza Android  
Thanks again Marq for another quick vid its always a pleasure to watch an honest guy talking tech Cheers bro "
My last iPhone was a 6 since then I was on Android I got tired of it now and Ill get the 15
"Team dont care here  I switched from an XR to a 14 pro a year ago and Im still getting a hang of it

I just enjoy watching your reviews"
Americans forget to mention that the reason Apple did USBC on the new phones is because of European Union laws and regulations Consumers pay billions of dollars a year because of proprietary lightning cable and there is tons of added garbage which is bade for environment If it was up to Apple theyd stick with the lightning cable
Im sorry but every iPhone is expensive and giving USB 20 speeds in regular iPhone is ridiculous USB 30 is not a pro feature anymore
Im tired of apple  
Why am I watching this when I cannot afford it
iPhone made in India
Thanks for the quick review I skipped the 14 so I am looking at the 15 Pro Max USB C isnt a big deal for me but the camera might be worth it
"No one cares






Paid for by the pixel gang"
Short review nothing changes except USBC they couldnt implement correctly
Very Saad Launching No charge same as 4 years
That apple shout out 
"You also forgot to mention that while the phone is 1100 Apple and partners are doing huge discounts on tradeins Im getting a 1000 discount My phone is going to cost me 100 bucks

Hard to beat"
Iphone upgrades from year to year be like add usb c and thats it which actually has been the standard on all other phones for ages as with everything else in 10 years apple may shrink the notch to the level of android phones or go to a fingerprint scanner under the display that would be such an innovation Gone are the days when apple was ahead thanks to better optimization and its cpu this year you dont even get newer cpu now its just a cry to watch the happenings
"When 1 8 dropped i was like Hmm i really dont think these changes warrant an upgrade They are good ngl but i dont think they are that good
9 dropped and i was like hmm thats actually good imma save some cash for it peak level corona hits and those plans go out the window and then they went with 10 and i was mad at them changing so much that was good with the phones

Meanwhile iPhone 11 to iPhone 15 major changes can be summed up with a two word sentence USB change"
Fast charging  That we will drip feed you in two years
hope they add double click function for action button
i realy thought about upgrading my 11 Pro to a 15 Pro but its a little underwhelming
great vid as always Marques i just have to say AGAIN it is a shame and disgrace that you still get 60Hz on a base model which costs 800 and anyone who thinks there is no difference just has to use one for 5 minutes it just feels way way smoother and premium and I think its really shameful to put 60Hz again while other brands put higher refresh rate displays on devices that are 200300 I absolutely hate the event and the new models and will stick with my 13 Pro until next year hopefully the battery will survive til then
leave it to apple to spread out the new feature type c will bring over the next years to stretch it out as much as possible xD
Iphone 7 users
i hope apple can make iPad SE without any camera and then reduce the price I dont know how many people take photos on iPad
"    
May peace be upon you from Allah the Most Merciful the Most Merciful 

             


Thanks For comment "
Is that David with the new Fuji GFX 100 II Will we see it in a Studio video 
I have one word for these Underwhelming I have an 11 Pro Max and Ive kept it 4 years in the hope that something big is coming with the 15 and it just hasnt The design is the same as before I dont really care about USB tbh Ive not long bought some AirPods Pro 2s and nothing else I own charges via USBC so Id be facing buying a new cable and carrying 2 around to make this all work the colours are really disappointing and thats sealed it for me I love my Midnight Green iPhone and the Deep Purple 14 Pro is a lovely colour so I was hoping for a really nice accent colour and nope 2 dark colours that are really hard to tell apart and 2 light colours that are really hard to tell apart Does nobody at Apple think that people who may want a Pro iPhone might want one that actually has some colour on it Looks like Ill be rocking my 11 Pro Max for a fifth year
The only phone in 2023 that cost more than 700 and no 120hz display
I charge my android phone from iPad mini 6 yesterday
Have a 14pro Too little has happen to get the 15 pro 
I have the iPhone 12 Pro would there be a noticeable difference between iPhone 15 pro Or does anyone think I should wait longer
I had a feeling the iPhone 15 will come out soon than later and I dont really like the new iPhone 15 phone Im just being honest here
USB2 speeds in 2023 Apple innovation at its best
A third button like Samsung already has
Gigabytes per second
Did he just tease the new iPhone SE
I was waiting for the release of the new iPhones so the 14pro will get cheaper  I got my 11pro max and I dont think I need the newest 15pro so I will get the 14pro I guess
baseline ipad also has usb c bruh
One word  meh
I switched from an XS to 14 Pro Max last year  the only feature of the 15 Pro max this year that would make me switch is the reduced weight but its not enough to justify the upgrade Same with the Apple watch  currently on Series 5 Cellular with low battery health and was waiting to see what the series 9 was like but think Ill just get a new battery in my 5 series rather than upgrading
Idc
5x zoom being exclusive to Pro Max is incredibly annoying
1035 is to get rid of the fisheye effect
You cant use Apple Card for 0 APR Apple Installments for iPhone if you arent with any major three carrier
What happened to those braided cablesss
Battery
Rise your hand if you watch the vid without any budget to buy one even a i12 
"100 agree with the title not just USBC USBC is almost not worth mention as its an industry standard for years now anyway

Two biggest upgrades to me are
1 Physical Action Button  if you know how to use shortcuts you can do really cool stuff with it
2 Weight reduction  I was in the store to see how it feels holding iphone 14 pro in a hand and in my pocket It was imediate no for me because of the weight Now with titanium this problem is gone"
Not much innovation but its Iphone it will sell regardless
This new USBC thing is so cool hope other brands get inspired
People need to stop buying a new phone every year This practice shouldnt be rewarded
What do you guys think I should get 14 pro or 15
Bad audio bad vid the sssssss hurtssssssss my earssssssss
"Fast Charging is kind of the basic nowadays  this technology has been like more than 10 years  apple would be way ahead if they just use thunderbolt 4 on this new phone here as a big chapter to change the history of iphone
If they did that  everyone would be so looking forward to this phone
Well  maybe this is exactly why Apple choose not to give a huge deal to type c  so people will forgot this change eventually"
I was almost certain you were going to start out with Ive been using the iPhone 15 Pro Max for 2 months now lol I am certain Im getting one ASAP
USB 20 on a new phone in 2023 truly an apple moment
Apple is clearly peaking The only problem is if they dont innovate its downhill from here
forcing Apple to have consitent cables is probably the most reasonable thing the European Union has ever done
I dont really see any changes tho am gonna keep my 14pro mx
Thanks for the video mate Always great content Been a staunch android user Galaxy until S7 and Pixel now but am considering making the move the apple Primarily as Im looking to make the change to a mac with my next laptop upgrade But it doesnt seem like there is a lot in the new iPhone that makes me want to jump ship just yet Correct me if Im wrong
You are just repeating what has been already said bro what about the battery for the four new iphones 
"You  awesome
New iphone  not awesome"
I dont want fast charging its proven how much this damages batteries  I like the fact even the existing models has built in overnight charging so the battery is not stressed electric cars work exactly the same its pretty fast till 80 full but after that batteries like to be charged slower otherwise it degrades as it gets stressed
Rip the ringer switch you will be missed dearly
Apple company is including a braided and colormatching USBC to USBC cable in the box though this cable is limited to the baseline 480 Mbps transfer speeds If you want to unlock the full potential of the Pro models youll need to buy your own capable cable  Dear god Ill stay with my 13 mini as long as possible
Soon as I can upgrade through Verizon Edge Ill be moving from 14 Pro Max 256 to 15 Pro Max 256
Dont care camp
No matter how much I love Apple products they are really getting on my nerves more and more as the years go on I cant stand their tactics the USBC port across the phone line up 10g not just the max It is complete and utter BS Rant over Great video you do an awesome job of getting us the details
more repairable  ah yes another thing EU will be requiring soon 
"Wow USB C  Imagine that 

Iphone may even have a fast charging feature in the future Apple is truly a leader in breakthrough technology "
"Keep in mind that the new USB 30 Speed is only available if you buy the OPTIONAL USB 30Cable 

Thats sooooo Apple "
Im in the third camp of my wallet would cry if I tried to care a little harder
Im sorry but replacing the lightning port with USB C and the mute switch with a button cannot be called features
We have arrived at a timeline wherein Android phones like the Samsung Z Series Flip5 and Fold5 devices are breathtaking whereas iPhone is ridiculously boring and overpriced all because of its integration with the Apple Ecosystem MacBook iPad Apple Watch AirPods etc They seriously need a new paradigm in their design language If it wasnt for the EUs legislation banning the Lightning Connector I dont think we would have seen anything interesting this year Like absolutely the same stuff with incremental changes Wheres the Apple Magic
Best scam  company c port now marketing how pathetic 
"Camp dont care at all

But alasthe insult of using
USB2 restricted USBC ports"
During the keynote I thought the mother nature would be MKBHD being awfully straight forward and honest with his opinion on their products and bro you are getting the  ibill  for that stay as well Just wait
30w charging cuts your battery lifetime in half you have no idea what you are talking about
Smash mouth incrementalism
Apple users paying 1400 for a slightly better camera and oh wait usb c that has been out for fkn years
Still 60hz display on 15 Skipped
Youre just not an apple fan
You forgot to mention the new depth feature HTC M8 had it ages ago
USB 2 speeds Damn apple is petty
yes this is the best iphone  yes its not just usb C  but to people who also have high end androids  the difference is just MEH USB C  i have that on my EX s23 ultra and on my FOLD 5 now  periscope lens  had that for years on samsung and its not something i even use that much so whats left  faster chip that i am not utilizing at all anyway men ill stay on my 14 pro and fold 5  fok iphone 15 its just the same phone all over again  couldnt care less that is lighter with few grams like srsly
iPhone is a scam 
"Did you notice that Lisa Jackson said Our aim is to permanently remove carbon from the atmosphere during the Mother Nature clip My jaw dropped to the floor
Its like saying our aim is to end all terrestrial life on Earth"
Hey Marques U didnt explain about spaitial  video  these video can watch in Vision pro
"To answer your last bit Marcus I watch your review videos because theyre your review videos
Much love brother "
"Hi 
Ill order the iPhone 15 PRO MAX to replace my 11 PRO MAX 
Will be a nice upgrade but for the 14 PRO MAX is not worth in most cases"
USB 20 Speeds 60hz refresh rates everything is slightly incremental slightly rounded rails thats it
Bottom line is nothing new
The base model comes with A16 USB C 20 60Hz Display 799 Powerful chip and 60Hz display usb C 20 Just thinking about it makes me puke at that price point What a waste of sand
I cant wait to buy one of these when the iPhone 16 comes out since itll be half price then haha
imagine seeing the action button turn into a haptic fingerprint surface on the side like they did with the home button i miss squeezing the pixels it felt so nice
Tbh I wanted to upgrade this year from a 13 pro max but no sattle Brown leather case anymore is a dealbreaker for me
952 Marques trying as hard as he can not to say Google Assistant
you missed the most important question can you sideload apps no hah and thats why i will never ever buy an iphone basically if you get an iphone you are willingly and at a high cost agreeing to a form of digital slavery sure android aint no better but at least i can placebo myself with a sideloaded app
Time to go for android
whats the point not having the same usb speed as standard  so disappointing this apple in the last years  just wait we might have also mag safe on the iphone no innovation at all
Apple is a dieing brand just let go apple
the bringing pro 14 stuff to cheaper 15 is actually really good for the budget
This launch gives the impression that APPLE has put so much focus on the Type C port that theres not much progress to be made
well apple were Forced to use usbC and thats the key Highlight of the 15s  thank you EU if not Apple wouldnt event care jack Shit on using USBC lmao
Im using the iPhone SE  1st Gen May upgrade to the 15 this year
The big difference is though if you break the glass on the new iPhone 15s they are much much easier to fix now have made it to where these phones are a lot more do it yourself on the fixing side
To make that clear because you seem to be oblivious to the fact that Apple didnt want to change the lighting port but had to because of the EU legislation that got signed a few years ago Ofc they could have done fastcharging and so on but thats probably reserved for their inovative iphone 16 pro max ultra suprme iphones
For me best phone will be the 15 or the 15 plus  but rumours were that they will be using 48mp stacked sensors from sony is that true 
TBH it wasnt Apples choice to move to TypeC if they wanted to sell in the EU then it was a forced move as the EU basically made them do it to be compliant If it was not for this it would be almost the same as the last iphone Apple need to step up their game and do something radical
You know that the USBC change happened because EU mandated it  No other reason than that
Its kind of shame to say iPhones newest feature is Type C USB in 2023 they should have given a lot other functionality and on top of that a USB port Also skipping action buttons fast charging onlyC 20 in 15 isnt good Thinking of moving to Pixel 8 if its promising
About time making 256gb the lowest storage for the iphone pro max I would classify 128gb of storage as harassment when buying such an expensive phone  Im definitely selling my 13 pro max for the 15 pro max My biggest issue with my 13 pro max is the weight 240g and I never had that with the 12 pro max 226g Now getting the 15 pro max 221g is going to feel great with even better reachability due to it being a bit smaller thanks to the narrower edges 
I would like to know if the pro Max has improved the video stability and auto focus features  but sure glad I can buy an iPhone with USB C for once 
lol all these stuff andriod has had it for years and no fast charging in 2023 is very disappointing
USBC without fast charging is a crime
Portrait mode later like Samsung does now 
looks totally the same as Im surprised
The videos great Whats wrong with the Audio
I have 14 pro max dont need to update  iPhone for 6 to 7 years
After the arrival of Iphone 15 while comparing it with Galaxy S23 Ultra I can confidentiality say that Apple has lost the war against Samsung Hit like if you think the same
I LOVE  YOUR ENTHUSIASM You love to go to this event You love apple products You are great in front of a camera You are showing your entitlement here buddy You should be so excited to go to an apple event Your channel grew big like your ego now Stay humble my friend iPhone 15 with a better camera and the island that is GREAT for regular folks like us Pro max with 5X zoom thats great Titanium wow like space material Weighting less too thats great on my pockets  But I guess you have to much money in your pocket so it wouldnt matter to you bro Please do us a favor and dont go to the next apple event if you dont really want to go Dont make me watch this YouTube video again next year
android guy no rite talkin bout iphone smfh
Hi MKBHD am watching though I cant afford non of the iPhones But i love your videos and am a huge apple fan
Dont be fooled This is literally the same phone as the 14 just with USBC
Im glad that Apple is nerfing USBC on the 15 because as someone with a 14 Pro Max I feel terrible about not getting USBC Lightning has caused such problems in my life for the one year Ive had an iPhone that werent a thing when I just used USBC Android phone and a MacBook with USBC ironically those were a better pair
No more people saying android charger lol
Wow thats a lot cheaper than I thought 799 and 899
60 hz on the regular models is ridiculous Its 2023 come on now
Totally getting one Feels a bit wasteful consigning my current iPhone 12 Pro only for app development testing but the way iOS upgrades work it wont be long before even the 12 will not be up for major iOS releases Only decision is whether to go for the the Pro Max and the 5x zoom Tough one
decent evolution but still no promotion on the non pro modelssadge
Stupid action button
"For so long Apple refused to use usbc again their own users interest Then the EU says Do it moron  and Apple suddenly changes it 
And the reaction of Apple users  
 Wow look at that new iPhone look at that smooth design Apple is really great"
Pro iphones get AV1 codec which is huuuge for streaming services
Battery health for fast charging
"One Port to Rule them All
Yesss my Precious "
trying hard to convince people when everyone knows its been the same phone for 4 years
Fast charging will be the new feature of iphone 16 wait till next year
iPhone 15 The base model is just enough 
The most interesting thing for me was the 35mm focal for the camera but I would love to know if its just digital crop or we are actually keeping the quality there  would be great an analysis there in the future Marques
Well based on phrase New iPhone is just last year Pro repackage I wish for iPhone 16 now
Why put fast charging in this phone when they can put it in next year
During the live apple also mentioned about connecting the pro to external storage drive for pro res videonot sure how it works but maybe i wont need to get the higher storage version
"Like every year the iPhone disappoints AGAIN
Except the 2000 nits peak outdoorAmazing everything else just the SAME boring and Im with the 11 Pro Max and tbh Its the first time Im REALLY considering to move to galaxy wish that at the following years well see some innovation and not the same things over and over againAnd Apple keep saying thats the best iPhone weve ever made"
11million views after 3 hours Boys got it on lockdown
No fast charging you think it takes 90120 minutes to charge  My iphone 13 pro max goes 2100 in about 50 minutes not sure what shit charger you useif you use a 35w charger its actually pretty quick and I get 7580 in about 35 minutes
I remember watching an Apple event introducing the iPhone 7 and 8 The new specs of the phones were mindblowing Literally I couldnt understand how Apple engineers could come up with incredible ideas and pack them into an iPhone This year and last and the year before it was as Marques said welcome upgrades but not bleading edge stuff
Piss off iPhone 15 Im getting the iPhone 16 Pro Max
Idk if its just me Im still using my Samsung galaxy s8 but dont these new button features seem too much like a Samsung
More repairable phone is also the new EU law It should be easy to repair and change battery
Wow what an overrated product Even usb type C is a big highlight for this phone  OMG
Why is it SOOO much more expensive in the EU
Hey anyone know where to find the screen wallpaper in the thumbnail for this vid TIA
The only reason that Apple adopted the usbc its because of the EU laws
Get s23 ultra instead 
"USB2

EU IS GONNA BE PISSED"
What refresh rate is the iPhone 15s screen
Macro and 3D spatial videos
"Funny how the 2021 iPad mini with A15 can do USB 31 but the iPhone basic and Plus with A16 cant
SoC version number goes up specs go down lol"
NOT IMPRESSED Apple fell off
Amen
Well its no big jump anymore but i dont care My iPhone is 6 years old now and cannot charge wired the battery only lasts 5 hours and phone calls sound like CB from the 80s So Ill get me a 15 pro and dont bother buying an iPhone until hopefully 2030
wow all iphone youtubers are not praising the iphone pro usb c and programmable button we had that on android for 8 years and still big notch damn
I wanna get one of those but buying in EU I would pay a hefty upcharge so I will wait until I am in the US in Oktober I can buy a 15 pro max 512gb and it will be cheaper than the 15pro 512gb here 
"Another reviewer struggling to say something nice about this same phone Good try but the struggle is so obvious I wonder if he is getting paid by apple but seriously its so NOT a upgrade 
This happens when you have a captive audience that must stay in apple ecosystem Why innovate when they will buy anyway"
"Apple dont do anything new
Same old phone just minor tweaks"
Given the tradein value that they are offering I will be trading in my iPhone 14 pro for a new iPhone 15 Pro About a week ago I received the new Shiftcam ultra lenses for the iPhone including the 60 mm telephoto and the 16 mm wide angle I am very excited to try those pro level lenses on the new iPhone 15 pro
When Apple dropped your name in the presentation I was thinking that your review might be a little biased towards Apple But you stayed true to you I wasnt blown away by the new phone Unlike most other tech channels on YT who are glorifying iPhone 15 you actually gave a more true analysis of the new iphone That island is an annoying as the notch when watching videos Im really considering to make a switch to an android phone even though I own a macbook ipad airpods and watch
Does iphone 15 supports 3rd party usb c cable
This time apple 15 series doesnt gives me goosebumps14 series looks much better
Ill look into the base version of iPhone 15
my pixel 3 can do most of that
"In italy iphones 15 are all cheaper than 14 ones were last year 
975 instead of 1029 for tha base model"
"I will start caring when they release a new mini These phones are way too big for me
Will upgrade to the 13 mini at some point when I get a good deal"
I might just get s23 instead of this
When your most notable new feature was forced on you by EU regulations you know youre on the cutting edge
Pov  Youre watching the plateau phase of phone innovation
Anyone has thumbnail wallpaper
"Havent seen Apple or anyone else say whether the regular 15 models have 120hz refresh rate Or at least 90hz
Does someone know"
dont care at all camp
Marques Brown Apple  is reviewing the latest iPhone let me guess the best phone of late 2023  and the best phone of 2024  008
Me waiting for the IPhone 16
USBC the Tesla of ports massively overrated
Surprised this video is 13 min long considering how little news there was
Usb type C  Crazy 
I will definitely get one  Thats what i would say if i had the money for it 
Ive had my 12 Pro for a couple years now but I might buy the default 15 in baby blue because its my partners favorite color its USBC and I dont really use the Pro features of the iPhones all that much anyways and the 15 will be better than my 12 Pro anyways Im gonna keep up with these videos and see how Im feeling I dont have the money for it right this second anyways
ITS OUT 
new iphone pro wow usb c and programmable button we had that on android for 8 years and still big notch damn
Would it be worth switching from 12 pro to 15 pro Have no problems with the 12 pro  which is the first iphone since 5 that i did not bother upgrading to mext gen
Charging speed are a joke reallyso is 60hzits an insult
Since the new iphones have A17 PRO does that mean the next nonpro lineup will have an A17 and not not A17 PRO hence creating even more gap between the non pros and the pros from now on
I think its becoming increasingly clear that Apple not only doesnt care but is actively manipulating And thats exactly why theyre losing ground Inflation is at an alltime high and the prices weve tolerated for years are unimaginable even for basic devices The customer is informed He knows that USB 20 is the technology of 2019 so its 4 years old and a USB C 30 jack costs 014 Since Cook it is no longer the apple way to make everything perfect but to sell the just tolerable in audacity I am convinced that more and more people will change their phones later and later and especially in the midrange segment there will be a massive switch to android at some point
Titanium stronger han what Not stainless steel anyway  Love the phone but having to watch the mother nature show with an obese angry female climate activist was cringe confusing sustainability and pollution with CO2 is still the art of the stupid
argh i wish there was an iphone 15 mini
Its amazing how positive hes being about a product thats basically exactly the same  He would usually all that out  Is he selling out
Is he recording from the iPhone mic Why is it so airy
Honestly speaking Apple is tripping for at least over 4 years we are stuck with this stupid design with 3 camera on the back  spice it up a lil bit just because we dont care much about gimmick stuff doesnt mean we want our iPhones to look the same 
"Its so cute 
But I like android more "
I feel like Apple are more than aware at this point that a certain demographic of people will buy the new iPhone every year regardless of how many improvements have been made since the last years model Then they are the average Joes who look at the iPhone slightly more pragmatically and can see how an upgrade is really only worth it financially every 3 years at least Type C is nice and all but its literally something they have been legally forced to do other companies have been using it for years
Im going to customize the action button to make a pizza for me
Do low light photos still have the green glare dots 
I wonder does the base iPhone 15s get the pro motion display this year
I  think my family thought I was crazy when I shouted after seeing apple quote you on the keynote
Added usb c and A17 pro chip tada new iPhone 15pro oh it was such a hardwork now sell it man its new really
This is the most depressing upgrade phone ever seen 
Honestly it really seem pointless to upgrade when the iPhone 14 is only a year old
basically nothing change just number 15 from 14
"Why u r not criticising much the point tht iphone 15 is still 60 hz in 2023
Like seriously whats the point of all tht display nd pro resraw features  dolby vision on tht refresh rate "
I thought the usb c iPhones were gonna be made specifically for the european models since they are required to have usb c and be portless outside of europe in order to sell magsafe accessories and make money from magsafe accessories since apple is not required  to have usb c outside europe The 2019 meizu zero concept phone is completely portless with no buttons no speaker grill no sim card slot esim only no usb port no headphone jack and charging is completely wireless with 18 watts I thought apple was gonna do what the meizu zero did but become a real phone
Finally now maybe regular developers will do something with the dynamic island its been mostly useless thus far on my 14 Pro Max
So basically nothing upgraded from last iPhone 14 pro
I really hope MKBHD to comment on the new Huawei cell phone lines and compare them with the new iPhones Should be interesting
"Apple didnt CHOOSE to switch to USBC ports they were FORCED to due to new EU regulations forcing every new devices to use the same port by 2024  Therefore to answer your question yes every single new Apple device and other brands will all have to have USBC ports from now on

There were also talks about Apple makng all their new devices charging port free in favour of wireless charging but it was a bit far fetched for the current times However I wouldnt be surprised if it does happen within the next 10 years"
I want that 35mm
Im waiting for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro review from you Marquess if its worth to upgrade Im owning an iPhone 13 Mini in kinda darkish green Im waiting eagerly for your review of both PhonesL
Why they dont implemented Tunderbold or USB4
They put a bixby button on their iphone
Phones costing nearly 1K or over 1K for some models is not worth the yearly update biyearly upgrade or 3 year upgrade You honestly do not need to spend hundreds of more dollars with trade in every year to have the latest phone that isnt even much different than the previous models
Probably gonna wait until the iphone 16 If Apple keeps with the same pace as now everything in the iphone 15 pro max is gonna appear on the IPhone 16 I have a iPhone 12 and although its not a bad phone I mean I could still use it for years some of the new features just the USBC are worth the change I bought the new IPad Air which uses a USBC and it would be much easier if my IPhone also had a USBC port Im gonna get either the 16 or 16 pro depending on what the new features are Hope they add thunderbolt and maybe a M1 chip Who knows the sky is the limit But a Iphone with a M1 chip would last at least 6 years without struggling
not interested thank you am waiting for oct 4 
I have the 14 pro max and i think i will wait until the 16 if they had given a better tradein may be another 100 i would have changed
This isnt a new phone its a refresh and it should be named as such Steve Jobs is rolling in his grave
I think one of the most Pro features that they finally unlocked on the pro phones with usbc is recording photos and videos directly to a drive Plus native Log video Pretty niche sure but I can imagine thats a big deal for iPhone videographers  vlogers etc
This video has brighter audio than usual
528 My main concern  so need the pro Specially that I love backing up my phone to my Windows PC tru the cable Or just making a long video and transferring that to my PC And 30 in 2023 on a flagship at least give us 31 but all good thanks for the type c and 30 on the pro 
The action button can now finally open a smart assistant ChatGPT
Still 60Hz on nonPro How is this company still existing Apple is only pro at artificial spec castration And people love it
Dont forget the type C move was forced on them by the regulatory bodiesApple could not find another way to make another ecosystem way to charge you more for a special apple only port
after 5 years on ios and 3 iphones I cant wait to switch back to android im bored about those new features from year to year just gimmicks
When USBC is the headline for your phone release You know youve stopped innovating 
Probably wait for iPhone 20 hehe
I will change to 15 pro from 13 pro USBc and the prores chip and av1 chip in there Thats good for editing on the iphone and I want to try that I wonder how that might work for fast product shots on iphone I understand that you can output 4k60 out through the usbc so that would mean using this thing as a mini computer Please give it a try when you get your hands on it Thank you
bless you and your content so grateful for sharing this information in your way thank you Marques
One things old specs was the BATTERY LIFE mah
He clearly has a more upbeat vibe in this video
"Its crazy how Marques said dynamic Island will be copied and nobody did expect apple own 
Its crazy how Marques said apple will switch to wireless charging before going to USB c but he was wrong there too"
When is it going to b available for purchase TMobile specifically
i am in camp i have an iphone 11  for what i am grateful for so it is time to switch camp
For all we can say about the EU their consumeroriented decisions and laws on these big MNEs are sometimes great
Like my own comment
Its disappointing that the new cameras are much darker than 13 pro max
It was like the Bluray and HDDVD wars where Bluray won This battle took Apple about 10 years and finally lost the battle to USBC but who is yet to win the war
What I find amazing is how Apple fans somehow find a way to be excited about these changes
Can you map the button to Bixby
Back to handicapping the smaller pro model with less storage slower transfer speeds lesser cameras Oh Apple
Watching still on my iPhone 12 pro

So iphone 15 pro max has a USBc but charges still at a WHOPPING 18w While the market has 240w charging phones
All just to get us to change our phones yearly 
I have been waiting for an iPhone with type C so I can now upgrade my 12 to the 15 But tempted by the 61 Pro so will wait for a side by side review of the two Checked and Apple trading will give me 215 for my 12 When I eventually get some new AirPods I will finally only need one charging cable
lol these small upgrades gets everyone excited cant understand why gotta be an Apple thing they only went to USBC because Europe forced them to cant understand the whole Apple groupies enjoy your insanely overpriced slightly tiny upgrades
1106 I see my man holding a GFX100 mk2 
Its not a new camera sensor its the same sensor from the iPhone 14 pro even the new pros have the same sensor I would think you out of anyone would get the right info you also said the iPhone 15 had all the same camera features from last years pro which again is wrong no pro raw
So far youre the only YouTuber in my subscriptions thats being realistic about this The others feel like theyre still in the hype of getting invited to the event and blowing things out of proportion without even realising it
"I am in the camp 13 mini got dropped I really hope that at some point we could come back below the 61 inch for people who dont wear a purse or a backpack everywhere and dont have very large hands 

Glad that the 15 Pro is back below 200g  that is a big plus"
A very boring new generation of iPhones but as my Xr isnt working like it should anymore its time for a new one
Im buying have the 13 skipped the 14 as I found the upgrade specs underwhelming but the 15 is a worthy upgrade No incentive to buy the new iWatch my 8 ultra is already flawless
I go back and forth I really like MagSafe I have a MagSafe pop socketwallet and its amazing  It I was thinking of going back to android and getting a pixel But if I do stick with apple Ill probably get one just because Im tired of having to switch cables in my wifes car for apple car play bc she has an android But I also have the 13 so I usually go every other year
So theres usb c and only 1 PRO this year Got it
I am still rocking with my Iphone 7plus
What iPhone is everyone getting
Finally the usbc but Im kinda ditching the Apple system now because I found that Samsung ultra series are better in mostly every ways
"A weird thought
When type C or the universally accepted connector that they looked to create back in the day made with a design similar to the old lighting connector

Like the type C is kind with a mix of male exterior and female interior Which goes into the female exterior male interior of the device you use it with

Why not have it simple and have a male for the cables and female for the device you use with

Basically why wasnt type c designed like the lighting connector back when it was created Because as far as I know the data or power transfer happens in the interior section of the type c cable"
I think iPhone 15 design very cool
Getting the pro in the UK Lets see how much it retails for
Was thinking about switching from iPhone 14plus to iPhone 15plus but i dont know why m not feeling that excited or satisfied with this launch The only thing that made me happy was that they launched 15 on my birthday Lowkey thankyou Apple
Jeez he really went soft on Apple I didnt know how far apple is behind
Wow what a disappointing upgrade this is
I am so glad I jumped ship to Android years ago
nothing but disappointment since steve died
So the iPhone 15 is meh
no camera impressions
Its time to move forward and go android My last iPhones was 2 X 11pro Max and the 13 pro Max Been thinking about Samsung or oppo flip
The only cool thing about launching a new Iphone is that you can buy the last years Iphone at cheaper price
pathetic  same old phone with a new model name 
Does the iPhone 15 or 15 has 120hz 
Its important to add that they actually got cheaper in some countries In Germany they increased the price from the 13pro 1149 to the 14 pro 1299 and now the 15 pro is 1199
Damn just glances over the most impressive thing and focuses on literally everything else
I miss fingerprint readers the Face ID is a pain
1055 i find apples marketingnaming with those additional focal lenghts a bit misleading Maybe its a nerdy photographer thing but those or just different crops they have nothing to do with different focal lengths
First they took the headphone jack then they took 3D Touch and now the Mute Switch Apple is becoming more generic each year
Happy with 12 mini
Alternate title Not just USB C it also USB 20
756  
The only reason they made the back more reparable is too say it on stage look more repair friendly and prolong their antirepair practices
i was waiting for red color pro max  disapointed 
In Germany all the iPhones except for the pro max actually got cheaper 
evolution has been dead for Apple for a long time 
Promax gets the telephoto zoom totally not because s23 ultra has it
Wait until next year to get fast charging
The reason i only care about the IP15 is I still use an iPhone 12 Pro So its time to upgrade
Im definitely upgrading to the 15 Pro Max with 512GB or 1TB if I can I dont upgrade often but I feel this will be worth the upgrade Im looking forward it AND I plan on buying a few Anker accessories as well as I do like that brand
I charge my 14 Pro on a dock Last time I plugged it in was about a month after I got it
Now my apple friends will steal my 65w fast charging OnePlus charger 
Im so excited about the USBC because it means I can finally move back to IPhone
The white looks like my 4 year old Android phones silicon cover
Pretty sure the 48MP main camera is different from the 14 pro
to all my iphone 14 brothers and sisters yes you can skip this year
"I watched your videos for two reasons
1 Enjoy and want to compare with Mrwhosetheboss
2 Two know the new fancy tech"
Why get rid of white color on the standard iPhone 15
Subtle changes but as said in good direction  So will wait till next one to get
Is the same phone Apple is sick they are no more an innovative company they make money with incremental upgrades that all Android phones already enjoying for years
I always upgraded to the latest iPhone pros since 11 Pro came out But this time Im gonna skip the upgrade nothing intuitive thats going me to want 15 pro Will be rocking my 14 Pro for one more year and see if 16 has anything intuitive that can change my mind
"Not Just USBC It is literally just USBC and an action button
We have to stop accepting companies releasing the same phone every year and pretend theres hype around it"
Underwhelming event in my opinion Yeah grade 5 titanium is amazing and all but majority of the iPhone users are going to put on a case on Day 1 anyway Camera upgrades are insignificant If I see it correctly the main sensor has not got a huge upgrade maybe just a coating to reduce lens flare
The natural color looks good
"No real incentive to upgrade this year  still using my iPhone 13 which is running well 

These small incremental changes are losing steam"
Apple just quoted an Android user on their keynote 
The 15 is probably the best value iPhone
This OMG NEW CHIP wont prevent your iPhone to be laggy af 4 years later Compared to 8 years old ANY Android phone iPhone is just a joke
The real question is can I charge an IPhone with lightning from the new IPhone 15 
1 mil in 2 hrs crazy
Hey about that customizable button have anyone heard about a brand called Smartism
I am pre ordering the iPhone 15 Pro Max 1 TB after being 9 years in the Samsungs S line my current phone is an S20 Ultra 512 GB very good but I want to try an iPhone and this new iPhone made me to why not to switch
For some reason I like the stainless steel look over titanium It looks more premium imo
Im in camp we finally got the 27 years old standard port
Surprised Apple didnt put a perpindicular USB C port on the back side or into the screen
"Honestly I dont find fast charging that necessary 12 Hours for a full charge for me is enough and I think also for most of people since there are chargers inside cars and everywhere If that would compromise the battery life and quality its even less necessary in my opinion for the battery life span and waste

Another thing that I know a lot of people dont care are the environmental achievements The fact that they have no more leather in any of their product and the list of sustainable changes is really a big step Especially since most of other phone companies dont care as much"
Power of the EU Commission 
Apple didnt fully utilize USB to make it better for iPhone 16
Honestly this must be the most underwhelming new iPhone being released in a while Im more than happy with my 14 Pro Max especially after seeing how the new 15 pro max is barely an upgrade
Yawn Ill wait until the day they remove the notch and put the front camera under the display Thats what Im waiting for Other than that I will stick with my current iPhone
Apple made you talk for 13min on nothing substantial
Another booring release which is not a bad thing if they did not remove mute switch using titanium and say they are sustainable is also BS and when are we going to get back pressure touch display for better UI experience 
Yeah i was considering getting the 15 and change from Android to ios for a couple of years But this is boring af I will go for the pixel i guess
baseline cheap iPad is already USB C though same speeds as the new iPhone 15
I dont care at all because I cant afford it 
Naah not worth it to upgrade if you have iphone 14pro max USB C as an upgrade Lol
I still really wish we could just copy photos right off of the device to a thumb drive like on Android Of course Apple would never allow that
The camera UI still defaults to the 43 aspect ratio instead of the now standard 169 This is incredibly annoying when taking photos It switches back to 43 whenever you exit and reenter the camera app
Thanks to EU 
So all in all disappointing
iPhone 15 they added a new button and usbc without fast charge woooow amazing
Just got a 14 pro max recently as a company phone maybe its good that I wait and see if next year has any improvements that are worth picking up
If you pause at the right time  024  you can see a History Channel version of Marques Brownlee saying Matte Black
we know why there doinit got me there
I really appreciate your honest opinion when reviewing products Most youtubers are just used car salesmen lol
For Poor people models no always on display and still on 60Hz 
I hope the new portrait mode is better in tracking hair
Theres one more thing that was missed here With the iPhone 15 Pro you can now capture spatial videos It uses the Ultra Wide and Main cameras to record stereooptic threedimensional video files The new Spatial Video file format can be played and edited on any Apple computer but the 3D video experience can be enjoyed on the Apple Vision Pro 
Usb 20  bruh
This might be the first iPhone Ill ever own
finally my guests will be able to charge their iPhone i wont need that lightning cable i found on the street nor having to reverse airelessly charge
Im in camp totally getting one of these after 2 years when Im ready to replace my iPhone 13 mini
"It looked like Marques really tried to dig out and show that there was something new and changed in iPhone 15 But there was nothing

Why introduce USB C just for the sake of it when you cant even use it for Fast charging"
Each new iPhone is great by default because it is not slowed one
you could shorten up the video from 13 minutes to 3 max nothing changed apple still misusing its power and robbing its customers I wouldnt even want it for free
I hate that they changed the Silicon name to Pro mehn it was much cooler as Bionic
Still using the iPhone 11 but my speakers are done  my screen is cracked it might be time to upgrade
you can thank EU for USBC in an iPhone Otherwise Apple would have kept the lightning connector for the next billion years or so
So the biggest thing they did was add usbc but gimped it so hard that its as bad as lightning 
I have been using the iPhone SE 2016 for 5 years and the only reason I cant anymore is because they stopped updating iOS for those phones I am keeping it for spotify and other uses but I am really going to miss the best small phone ever
iPhone 15 doesnt get pro raw
Eh nothing exciting or innovative here Apple being Apple as usual Always a good analysis from Marques 
Titanium is not stronger than steel Its a misconceptiom pushed forward by holiwood It just has a better strengthweight ratio Yield strength which is used for tensile and bending failure criteria is lower on Titanium than on Steel
Its going to cost 800 in the UK ridiculous price
Huawei mate 60 pro
Its kind of a weird feeling suddenly the airpods are an option for me
Im on the 14 pro max will wait 4 the reviews
I always wait for your video to see what is REALLLY in the new phone iHole was cool enough to sell me but its been 98 useless so far it was really tradein value that got me last year This year yeah were waiting for 16Pro 
Awesome job marquess with the tech review 
They just took the 14 gave it a usbc and called it 15
What about the refresh rate of the screen Is that still only upgraded on the Pro model That was why i bought the Pro last year Makes such a difference
Not worth to upgrade
I have an iPhone XS with 64Go of storage and I have no more space I am changing this year 100 I am just not sure if I should go pro or pro max as I also use my phone to play video games so a bigger screen sounds appealing but it also looks so huge to hold it properly with just one hand for anything else than gaming
waiting for the 16
I think the easier to replace back is already the first step in the direction of user removable batteries We have seen now that the EU laws do make Apple change anti consumer things so they will also let people remove batteries themselves in the future
USB C  a whole lotta nothin  Got it
Boring upgrades
Im probably getting the 15 pro solely for the battery life compared to the 15
Ill buy my first iphone when they finally introduce fast charging
I thought adding the ability to record video to an external hard drive was pretty rad I thought you might have featured that too Great initial vid MKB and team 
They probably got rid of the lower gb pro max because how large the videos are
Well I still have an X since its release so I think it is time to finally upgrade I am for sure getting the 15 pro
"A little underwhelming
Why no thunderbolt
So next year they can add it to the pro and say how many  faster it is "
yeah yeah im waiting for the pixel 8 pro
fast charging is the worst thing ever
Absolutely astonished how you just skipped over hardware raytracing that iPhone 15 Pro now can do Thats a first for a mobile chip Before it was just software based
Cant wait to get onein like 4 years
This time Tim Cook compelled to remove word revolutionary  from his presentation 
"Who wants to charge their Ipods with wire Wireless reverse charging is available in many other phones and Ipoone 15 is taking people 3 yrs back
Putting USB type C was not a big deal as they Apple themself put Axe on their feet by using lightning cables and what not stuff and charging customers bomb for purchasing connectors
Rest all are camera and other features are available in Ip1314 then whats the point in purchasing something not worth the money"
stahp bruv you aint linus
AYO did MKBHD just rizz me up at 011
 Why not fast charging its there selling point for next year
To be fair Im still sure that the real thing USBC enables the one Apple really cares about is being able to sell it in Europe
kinda disappointed with no fast charging too at least do give us 35w fast charging will be great
come on apple with their small  incremental upgrades I have a 13 pro max and dont think Ill be upgrading this is sad apple
USBC without USBC features REVOLUTIONARY
Pro max seems like its going to be the one to go for if your going to upgrade That 5x zoom will be amazing
Im in the iPhoneUpgradeProgramme camp so will be upgrading to iPhone 15 Pro Max for that juicy camera
Still no full manual mode in camera Not even on the so called Pro phones
So theres benefit for USBC on the regular iPhone at all
"Having the pro name in the chip creates a distinction between iPhone 15 pro and the future vanilla iPhone 16 which will then get the a17 chip

So we cannot say thing such as last years pro phone but packaged differently"
They should have made a chocolatecoffee coloured 15 pro
If anything this video reminded me of how excited I am for the Pixel 8 later in october As someone thats had only iPhones since the 4s its time to jump ship
Upgrades 
My iPhone XR is starting to get a little long in the tooth maybe the 15 will be my next phone
Im still using a iPhone 11 and its still good
If youre gaming on an iPhone ur tweaking
10 gbps with USB3 is actually quite a big deal for me because I dont have to worry about cheaping out and getting the pro with the smallest capacity I can just move stuff off the phone and dont need to get icloud
Oh damn that portrait mode feature reminded me of those novelty Lytro cameras that were a thing for a brief second over a decade ago Quick google search shows that Apple had patented this sort of tech back in 2011 Interesting to observe their timeline between idea inception and incorporating the tech
All this tech are old enough to android users all the best Apple users
Arre they still shipping with 60Hz refresh rate screens
i was thinking of trying an iphone for a first time but since its still with a 60hz screen i wont
Dont care Im upgrading for sure Coming from an iPhone 11 Been waiting for usbc forever
The fact its still only USB2 speeds is the definition of malicious compliance I mean why  This only hurts consumers
"Iphone 15  copies samsung galaxys features 
Galaxy S24  copies apple iphones features 


The rest of the phone copies everything that they can and then trying to maxed out "
Huawei the king of all smartphones is back Now using Iphone X waiting to buy Huawei next year Apple sorry
Arent getting married bro 7 are getting old now
You are just sugar coating the incompetence of Apple to innovate something revolutionary 60 HZ in 2023 for 800 Dollars same design language for 5th year in a row Even the 5x zoom is laugh worthy Huawei gave 5x zoom in 2019 Apple is worst company milking money from the naive customers with slapping that apple logo its criminal
There is nothing to see this year
"The only difference was adding a usable camera and putting the normal charger port on it

The only reason I went to iPhone last year was because I was salty about my s10 type c port failing due to a blatant design flaw"
Feel like I just got my 14 with how fast the year went For once Im probably going to wait another year
Wht mkbhd no response on 15 refresh rate
Going to get the natural titanium with  my matching ultra watch
The usb is becuase of europe new law
Does anyone have Marques wallpaper of the iPhone 15 on the cover of his latest video dedicated to the iPhone 15
"the new button will likely break easily

because  apple"
Ill keep my iPhone 13 its all the same shit 
The Pro models titanium material is something else to produce the frames from Tough to machine possible with only the sharpest of tools and it will undoubtedly be springy if bent at an angle Maybe some YouTuber is going to put the phone to the test with a drop test from a speeding car or so Well I can tell you grinding titanium produces beautiful white sparks I think its a great achievement
I will wait for the next upgrade This is not enough of a difference or value to push me to change
Apple is on good old milking strategy
"630
no fast charging on the phone because fast charging will be a feature of the made for apple usb C cable and not for the phone that way they apple can still sell over priced cables in a market with cheaper options"
Apple cant make invention no more they just copy paste last years pro to the base this year Theyre slowing down
USBC 2 in a 2023 product should be a crime
Omg iPhone has no fast charging
"I think that you convinced me to not trade in my 12 Mini with this video I was feeling an itch to upgrade to the shiny new toy but
USBC is nice but I still have to have some Lightning cables around for my base iPad No bump to connection speed with the connector change No action button Im never buying a Pro Ill just get a new battery in my 12 Mini and call it a day"
What is the refresh rate
Sheep  phone
This video is  fastest  to get to million views How amazing is that
You got a good point no new fast charge lmao like seriously smh U S B C
"Knowing how much apple cares about feel in the hand i think the switch to titanium was actually to get a satin texture around the whole phone which couldnt be done with the stainless steel 

Aluminum isnt an option for the pros anymore either since its been bumped down to not premium considering its reserved for the regular iphones now"
Apple the old Android but pink and less customizable
Coming from the iPhone 13 Pro Max as a consumer non professional photographer I struggle to see the benefits of upgrading my 2 year old phone As usual the changes feel very incremental and especially with this price its very difficult to justify spending so much on a new pro
"I like the new iPhones but feel they are getting tech that should have been implemented 2 to 3 years ago Thank god they finally went USB C even if it was 2 years too late to sell me an iPhone Pro The Mini is great and much more pocket friendly but if the pro had the ability to down load photos and video at a reasonable speed it might have been more interesting at the time Not giving basic USB C data speed to the 15 and only giving the basic speed to the 15 Pro seems a bit pathetic It would be great that they are finally making the phones repairable if they allowed 3rd party repair but they dont so that just points out a MASSIVE weakness that Apple has The only really interesting thing is that the A17 Pro chip is now powerful enough to play full console games which would be useful if I gamed on a phone still nice if the cooling can keep up

PS The Fairphone 6 looks very interesting"
Ill either get the pro max or wait for the 16 since i have the 14 pro
Where is the Airpods max 2
Why Iphone 15 doesnt come out with 120Hz display
Its just interesting to see that apple takes baby steps after baby steps with every new generation to have something they can still improve every year I mean its genius they can sell this features as innovations in their own ecosystem nonetheless these arent innovations just polished versions of very aged tech Usb c but without the 31 Standard and without fast charging so they can add that next year When they would go all out and install flagship phone features from 2023 there would not be much to add next year except for doing it for the lower tier iPhones like they already do it now so for example next year the pro cameras come to the normal iPhones an so on an on  So on the one hand its sad that this seems so slow but on the other hand if you are part of this Ecosystem you have something liiiittle to be excited about every year Not speaking of the chips those are real innovation power monsters just talking about the features
same 1T
ehh
 Your friends Android phone   something is there
These reviews are tedious at this point The question marks as to why not this or that are business strategy to sell product from year to year What in the hell would they benefit from giving us everything in one phone and futureproof that phone for the next 5 years Obviously these reviewers know this and are hinting at tech that will come so they can make themselves feel like theyre in the know or maybe the viewer mostly but realistically they understand the process of business and production and marketing and all the stuff that goes on in the background If you bought the 14 you dont need the 15 and wont probably need the 16 17 18 or 19 until the 20th comes along with some real new quirk
Apple you may have ONE button
Great video as always Doing great work Strange you downplay hardware raytracing in the phone But I am not surprised you are not really the gaming guy
Not just a type c  like for real
Coming into this everything apple added was something taken from from another phone from years ago or a software locked feature Apple stuns the world and does it again Ill buy 3
I love using both iphone and samsung plus I use a pixel
Why is MKBHD gloating about flying business class
"iphone xs max  motherboard shorting
iphone 12 pro max  over heating
iphone 13 pro max  white screen
iphone 14 pro max  green screen
wonder what will be in iphone 15"
There is something wrong with the sounds it sounds 2x speed
Im still on the 13 pro and usually swap every two years so theirs some sizeable upgrades for me which is good
i have seen so many reviews of apple event but Mkbhds Video is really a far ahead of them whether in event details of event and quality 
iPhone 13 pro max 2 years in For the next two years this is going to be my phone I dont care if apple is giving away a MacBook Pro 15 inch with the new iPhone 15 pro max I am still not going to buy one I buy a new iPhone every 4 years and no amount of updates is going to break my cycle
Will upgrading from XR to 15 pro be noticeable
Can someone explain the benefits of USBC other than You only need one cable for everything now  I have a XR and never had an issue with cables PC user also with consoles and various other tech etc So what Im saying is why would I get the 15 over a 14 pro
The most boring thing apple introduce to anyone
fast charging makes battery hot and causes it to degrade faster 20W is plenty
"Apple Well guys we finally did it We listened to all your feedback and decided to give you USB C on the iPhone 15 We want you to enjoy your iPhone and we think youre going to love it 
The EU "
So essentially nothing Apple did nothing Yknow its true when Marques is gushing over the brushed titanium bezels retrospective portrait blur a customizable button
The New iPhone 14S
So I have an iPhone 13 and thinking about an upgrade  I actually found the apple event a bit underwhelming  Im sure the new 15 will be a better handset but Im not sure its a big enough leap to make me part with what is a perfectly useable phone with a decent camera jury is out for me   And changing the subject isnt it about time they did a redesign of the look of the Apple Watch  And where is AI being utilised on the new phones
Unfair video if Samsung makes changes in its device you said only few changewhen apple release iPhone you said game changer
Anyone else notice David with the gfx100II
huawei mate 60 pro is best phone thanks
So Apple dedicates a large part of the presentation on their dedication to become climate neutral and then they FLY in a bunch of press and influencers to their event Hypocrites
Now people will experience that weak plastic floating inside the USBC port lol Its always the first thing to go in my work laptops good luck
"So when apple puts a bixby button its suddenly a great thing

Still love my bixby button functioning as a camera button and hate reviewers for making samsung get rid of it"
"Im camp wait til there is a more significant difference between the Pro Max 14  and 15 

So far its
1 USBC
2 New Faster Chipset
3 Programmable Side Button
4 Camera Lens
5 Bezel 
6 Titanium Casing"
Just USB C
Well I understand the motivation to express usbc as big change but practically not a life changer Everyone already has lightning no problem with finding or buying Also practically lightning has a more robust physical structure than usbc It is a change but not a big forward step
USB type C is sure thing a big deal to Iphone users while for android users that is not a big deal 
 Good bye Lightning connector 
Apple is soo old school
Also earlier mute stwich had a orange indicator which showed its on silent mode from distance whereas now we have to chk the screen 
AV1 hw decoder on A17 Pro worths mentioning this is YouTube and YouTubes one of the new feature is supperted first time by Apple
Titanium isnt stronger than steel but its strong for its weight in a weight vs tensile strength perspective
"600 if theyd done thatwhat new feature would they add in the iphone 16
come on Marques you should know better"
For action button how can I understand whether phone is muted or not when I look my phone before I took in my hand for example my phone is on the table and I can understood if I forgot it muted when I looked it from a distance I do not liked that action button tbh
Apple couldnt have been less excited to announce the USBC switch the announcer woman even had a sullen  annoyed look when doing so
hi
Base model still 60 htz  what a joke
I have the 13 pro and although i had regret spending that much money at the time i absolutely love it and have no intent to switch anytime soon
"Wheres the features blood all the time so
Type C is the feature "
"USB 20 for iPhone 15  30 for pro models 
Why thoI was expecting usb 30 in all models "
yawn boring stuffAndroid will always be ahead of Iphones 
So yeah its just a 1000 Iphone with USB C is what i got out of this lmao
The new 15 pro max being slightly better than the 15 pro takes me back to the 12 pro launch when the 12 pro max was slightly better than the 12 pro
"I would have made the iphone design different like this

On the back the  symbol  i  where the dot was the apple logo and behind the apple logo was the main camera  behind transparent glass and the rest of the 2 or 3 cameras under  the line of the symbol  i  also transparent glass   the symbol  i  was on the same level as the back of the phone 
Looks more closer to the idea of the  i Phone  Something new in my opinion"
this is my upgrade year my 12 pro max is over heating
I think a cool feature with the new USBC port that most Youtubers that were at the event dont mention is the ability to record to an external SSD which will really be great if you dont spend the money to upgrade storage
Why dont they stream the live presentation from the Steve Joby Theater anymore
Ill get it my iphone x is starting to become a headache
in whole 13 min what we learnt iPhone is now charging with C cables and iPhone case is titanium What a development Anyone with a healthy brain can understand that there is no meaning to buy 15 or 15 pro as they are just little made up version of 14 pro I think it is the right time to quit Apple ecosystem
Im waiting for iPhone 2021 maybe there will be a new design
Ntn on Siri
"Its definitely will be flopBecause the  is back
HUAWEI"
Apple are still so far behind Samsung
Congrats on the Apple shout out Marques Glad to see they pay attention to your no BS no choosing sides approach I dont care about the marketing hype I care about features functionality and real world use cases Thats why I come HERE Thank you for keeping it real
"You missed about
1 Battery size
2 USB C cable included or not
3 4K 60FPS Cinematic 
4 Spatial video"
"Always wanted Titanium Thats the huge feature Together with the somewhat new slim look
The 3n chip 24mp photos and 10gbit usbc are also great
Thats basically the difference to last year Not too bad"
best value iphone is always last years model
so useless
That beard of marq reminds of king tchalla
As someone upgrading from an iPhone 12 this year Im glad I waited the few months for this That being said Im not sure my use of the button will justify the loss of the silent switch 
Watching on my IPhone 8 
lol 2023 and they still have USB 2 on the base model Ridiculous
Bro what new design
Marques you do know that the fast charging is ruining the battery right You talking about the lack of it in the iPhone all the time but you never mention the bad side of that feature
Waiting out for the red one
I hope they bring the mini back at some point  My 12 is still going strong but I want to be able to replace it eventually and I dont want to go back to Android again like I had to after the first SE
Apples tech is simply so advanced that there is not much they could do to get any better every year People seem to not be impressed by Apple rolling out the same brilliant tech with a few upgrades at almost the same price as the last years flagship rather theyd prefer some tech giant showing up every year with some sort of useless gimmick
Wow so different from 11 12 13 14 cant even recognize its an iphone wow so  revolutionary
why is no one talking about charging speeds with the C type and USB 3 in pro models does that mean a substantial decrease in charging time Its really a big deal
Oooofta still accepting sponsorships from anker after they lied about their surveillance through eufy or eufie not sure
petr mara in the video 1019
Im a sheep and have subsequently had EVERY iPhone since the 3GS Im just going to stick with my 14 Pro this year I dont blame Apple but until Aliens drop us some spaceage tech phones have felt like theyve simply peaked Every new year is more and more underwhelming than the last
Not much of an improvement over last gen USB c at t speed of USB 20 is laughable I was really hoping this was gonna be the phone I would wanna buy but after the release its not looking like its gonna be an exciting upgrade for me
Yo is the other dude sorry I forgot his name  from the waveform podcast just chilling at Apple with a Fuji GFX 100 II
Sad they got rid of the dark purple Thats what I have rn But I like that new raw Titanium look
So underwhelming Im about to step outside to lay down my whole body on the grass
11 pro max 256 here and still happy no need to upgrade until apple nerf it in an update 15 doesnt bring anything new enough for me Great content as always dude
An S year
"about 750 
I have been in phone repairs for years and how strong the metal band is absolutely makes a difference in if the screen breaks or not If the metal casing is thinner and the phone falls there is a greater chance that it deforms putting presure on the glass in a localized area If the metal keeps its shape the forces are spread around more and that gives your glass a better chance of not breaking"
I think this year this is the one to get
I wished apple made a budget phone with a pop up camera you just know how amazing they would make it with high quality they are pretty durable anyway It would be for the people that dont really use cameras so we experience the large clean screen Like im pretty sure theres a vast majority of apple users that barely use the selfie cam
the mention of your person and this channel is amazing to evoke confidence on the work i get an iphone 14pro a month ago and i feel like an early adopter like my mac pro 2016 but the lightning is something i really aprove totally doesnt matter the bad for me is the usb 2 and 3 for not been capable of read usb 31 or even a hard drive
i like the white 
Id like a 7 inch M2 iPod Touch  That would be nice 
You cant use USBC to charge the apple watch 
Tim Cook Loves you 
where is the lightning to c adaptor for your older devices
Iphone 15 is really sweet like an apple 
Europe is requiring one type of charging for all phones selling on market Apple didnt like it and tried to fight it to keep their own charging but they would not be able to sell iPhones in Europe So they had to change it not to loose European market Anyway but what I believe they also did is they limited some speed and functions for that basic universal  USBC charger  So do you wanna have super fast data transferring  and super speed charging You still have to go to Apple and buy their own USBC charger to get it Typical Apple they just dont like to lose
where can i get that thumbnails wallpaper
"Titanium The best strength to weight ratios among any material Its so strong it is used for spaceflight
1 hour later let me put it in a plastic case I dont want to damage it"
Iphone 15 just like iphone 14 but with usb now yay
Absolutely zero innovation here
Iphone 14 pro for the next 3 years 
I AM STILL WAITING for APPLE TO DITCH WIDGET SECTION I hope they give us option to disable it 
"Say thank you to the EU for the USB port 

And soon we will have user replaceable batteries 

Not bad for a bunch of bureaucrats"
Whats the cost in usa
This is a pretty decent update Mainly in the Pros the Camera Action Button and USBC alone will change some important parts of the regular users experience
Still no 120hz display
Honestly the biggest feature with each upgrade is the camera Unless youre a heavy camera user it really isnt worth the upgrade I have a 12 Pro and it does me fine
Make no mistake they wanna keep the lighting cable to keep on charching  for a simple cable We can thank the EU for standardizing devices to the superior USB C
Resident Evil Assassins creed mirage and Death Stranding on iphone  I think thats disruptive Marques  There are no smartphone capable of doing this A processor that can match high end APUs
"Wow new customizable button for your phone 

My Samsung Galaxy note 9 has it Type C with Samsung dex in it 
Also for some reason during and after Apple events Samsung increases their ads frequency Fun"
60hz phones these days is like committing crime how can you have such exp phone with 60hz display 
Was thinking of trading my s23 ultra in for a iPhone 15 Pro max and then he says no fast charging turned the video off
No bright color for 15 pro series maybe 2024 spring release 
I think people really underestimate the Quality of Life improvement these new iPhones will bring for mixed platform house holds  no more having to swap out USB cables when plugging into the car for navigation No more where is my charge cableeveryone can use the same cable USBC EVERYTHING
Same nonsense pure insanity
I was a long time Apple lover since the Iphone 3 and nobody could convince me to switch UNTIL i got the Samsung Galaxy s23 switched from Iphone 13 pro max ultra and holy Jesus The Iphone is nothing compared Not even the 14 Especially the camera The Samsung pictures are unreal and I always thought Iphone had the best one until I got my eyes opened Its sad to see that Apple mainly only focuses on optical stuff and not so much on performance There was no big upgrade from the XR I had before the 13 Battery graphics and camera are the best I ever had If Apple ever comes up to Samsungs level I might reconsider
Nice Upgrades However Im Still Learning And Enjoying How To Use My IPhone 13 PRO MAX So When I Get Bored Or Tired Of It In About 2 To 3 Years I may Consider The 15 PRO MAX Im Not Going To Be One Of Those People Who Changes Phones EVERY SINGLE YEAR ANYMORE Its RETARDED 
Really excited about the new action button Would use the action button to launch silent mode
I really want that wallpaper in the thumbnail have seen it before on the channel as well but was unable to find it with my googling skills If anyone has a link to the same it will be much appreciated 
Ill buy an iPhone when it has a headphone jack expandable storage and I can use the full size of the screen rather than having an ugly useless gigantic notch on the only place it shouldnt be the screen
Fast charging will be next year or the year after Basically whenever Apple decide its the big feature thats going to sell more phones that year
Action button is being mapped straight to google assistant via shortcuts That will replace my backtap to trigger the assistant
In other words the REAL improvement are USB C and
Honestly Im still on the original SE Yes the iOS isnt on 16  and only 80 capacity left but still works fine 800 for the basic 15  if it was 400 Id get excited Still on the iPad Air Max think bought 2016 and works fine
"So sad that now that they have finally switched to USBC they have done it completely unfinished Just to have a Upgrade for the next year probably

Apple has become a company that actually hinders Innovation as it seems"
Remember when you had to ship your iMac to Cali to get a video up asap Those were the days
I just want the camera bump gone
Maybe one day the regular models can get at least 90hz
Everybody who has an iPhone knows they spend hundreds of dollars on chargers they needed to change it
He portrait mode isnt new
The smartphone world is dead It has reached its peak and hard to improve on the previous version almost no differences anymore just gimmicks
Can the action button have two stages press to mute hold for camera
"Had them all iPhone 12 Pro Max
iPhone 13 Pro 
Iphone 14 pro max aint switching this time imma stick this one out didnt really change at all"
456 I think you kinda skipped a huge leap of an upgrade here Full AAA videogame titles will be playable natively  not streaming on this device  Which is insane Dont know if its exclusive to apple due to the the A17 bionic But well see
Its not interesting by
The EU forced Apple to make the switch to USBC They wouldve never done it if not for this
No reason to get android anymore
You should note how old USB 3 is and that the iPhone 15 still has a 60Hz screen This is embarrassing
When are we getting a flip and fold
"Its still funny to me that there is still no fast charging and still no full usb 30 speeds across the board
Oh well maybe next gen am i right"
So its another year of if you have an iphone from last year dont get this iphone
I think the reason all of those features are only on the pro iPhones is because the average iPhone consumer doesnt want a complicated phone he wants a phone that works well and he doesnt care for the complicated feature and gimmicks that hes not going to use
The 15 display is still 60Hz
S A M E
Apple brings to the new iPhone 2 years ago Android technology Well done
what means new accessories for iPhonethere already a lot of them for USBC lol
Apple for sure has lost the game of creating new update styles I am good with my previous model
I like to watch his videos for his presentations of whatever tech he reviews It is just something about the dynamic of how he presents it all
USB 2O speeds 2023 model phone Big step up
still minor upgrades lol no reasons to buy still stuck at 60hz and no fast charging lmao
Flying first class
I love Apple products too bad Im Ibroke Pro Max
HuaweiMate60pro is best than iphone 15pro
As a samsung galaxy s23 ultra owner Im not impressed s20 ultra is a better phone
Bring back the Mini These phones are boring af
Lets gooo made in India Finally
Pretty much the same phone as every year difference is is the new button feels the same as the sony button They needed to change to the usbc Im a Samsung S23 ultra user myself dont think its worth tbh
RIP gold iPhones 
My first iPhone was the 12 mini Being a tech lover the mini was so interesting to me What a powerhouse it was Wouldnt mind a 15 or even the 15 pro
Apple has been crumb feeding since day 1 I bought the 14 pro Max never having a IPhone a day in my life and the disappointment is real  iPhone is slowly releasing old tech thats introduced to iPhone users as New tech and the tech been around since 2009 Apple is trash and same repetitive phone with minimum to no specs or specs from 2016 calling it New 
Is the sound slightly off on this Seem sped up a little
wait Apple capped the USBC speed hahaha
This is the only iPhone I have ever actually wanted to own at release but I am still going to be waiting for the reviews to see if the new features are actually worth it
now they are upselling usb speed as a feature that company greed too damn high
Does everything but mute
Hate to say this but i am switching to android Samsung to be specific after using iPhone for more than 12 years And having a perfect ecosystem apple ecosystem
ofcourse there will be no fast charge because its Apple they will add that next year as a NEW feature hahaha
I realllly hate that action button The mute switch is super useful Now it makes thinks just more complicated and cluttered In already had these options with just a swipe No need to change at all
104 ONE PIECE
Im in a camp  dont care at all Just watching to see if there is finally something intriguing from Apple but still looks like just another scheduled upgrade without anything interesting
you can tell the usbc change was last second zero features from the past decade on there unless you pay a grand for the old tech thats wild man hoping the 16 is somewhere closer to 2010s technology
"The 15plus is the phone to get now
I hope ill get 1000 usd when it finally sales in "
Waiting to see how New features really make a difference
android rep here hey Iphone users welcome to our usb type c you can use my charger
Nothing special again Thanks Apple
can u press the action button to take a screenshot is there a palm swipe guesture for screenshots like samsung phones
To me being able to play Resident Evil 4 remake and Assassins Creed Mirage on an iPhone is absolutely incredible and way more important than the usb C
I think the new Watch feature is pretty cool even if it is gimmicky but other than that this event was kind of lame I mean one of their main selling points was iPhone holds its value more than any smartphone lmao They really had nothing much to say cause its essentially the same exact thing as iPhone 13 and 14 Were heading into 2024 and the 800 base iPhone still has 60Hz Thats ridiculous The only reason Ill be getting it is because Im due for an upgrade and since I keep my phones for two years it makes sense to go with the newest one but its still underwhelming
Really disappointing that the 15 doesnt get promotion
Bluff 
Notchislandpunchhole  skip
Think its really hilarious how Apple allows more customization on the side action button than some ANDROID phones Crazy world to be in
Probably upgrading my 12 mini to 15 Pro afraid that the 67 inch in the pro max model would be to big of a leap for me and also the price tag is noticably higher Cant decide between the colour thou either black always loved those or the new amazing blue
Finally no glossy finishes because I hate that so much
Its fun to watch apple bending the knee to androids
60hz in 2023
Tim Cook mentioned you man That moment was awesome
Cant wait for pixel 8
Always hated usbc The major reason for me to switch to iPhone from Samsung was the charging port its very fragile get loose over time Incase if some lint is stuck in the port you cant clean it up with a needlepin like you can do it on lightning port
My Bought on launch My 11 pro is working good absolutely unmarked never dropped absolute zero issues battery health still 89 its hard to consider a change
with usb c its looking like an iphones  android clone 
Wow look at that A 9 Year old connector is the Headline Feature of the new IPhone
OMGUSBC Revolutionary Courage
Hi does the Action Button work when the iPhone is locked For example to take a picture
Just another yr same old same old worthless upgrades
No pen again  Welp guess S24 ultra it is They can have my 1600
1400 for a phone Think Ill pass this year too
Its just a shame that the iPhone 15 Pro doesnt get the 5x Telephoto lens not everyone is a fan of bigger smartphones
hahah 800 for new usb port
Interesting review BORING as Pro update Like really boring
There really isnt anything major besides the 3nm chip changing about it
when people ware inside with you in that room they ware looking at you with admiration from an old remote in the Livingroom to probably the best and most consistent tech reviewer on the planet 
When they talked about grade 5 titanium and showed the material is used in space missions I pictured fast and furious 9 Just Ludacris
To me the big news is that we STILL have 60Hz screens on the base iPhone  Still while 300 Android phones have been at 120Hz for a few years now  Also wanted to mention has anyone said anything about how Dynamic Island on the base model ends up taking up way too much screen on a fairly small phone
Same shit again 
"Ehhh I was ready to switch to a smaller phone this year

But I do take a lot of photos on an iPhone and I kinda like 5x more then 3x

Why did they do that "
xx
So basically it is iphone 14 with usb c
I Think Im going Pro Max this year again Had the 12 Pro Max as my first iPhone ever then switched to 13 Pro for smaller form factor I kinda miss the bigger screen and the better battery life Im also pretty confident that I might be using the 5x lens a lot
iphone 14s
Wow I got that phone 5 years ago Yall are late
wtf why MKBHD still taking Anker sponsorship seems like everyone on the internet knows Ankers bad reputation
To sum it up Welcome Apple fans to the USB universe   Lots of Android fans would love to share their chargers Please Dont Buy it  separately
Its funny how Tesla tried to remove all buttons and switches following in apples foot steps But now Apple has added another button realizing not everything can be easily accessed on a screen Hopefully Tesla can do the same
Wanna be Xperia
Just watch to see if any new future of it
I love the subtle sarcasms USB C  biggest feature of a 2023 pro smartphone
Does Apple not do anything innovative anymore I mean sure the USBC is a big deal but USB 20 speed for the non plus  and no fast charging or wireless charging what up Apple
Thanks for the reviews MKB
Same looks since 11pro
Ur name was mentioned as a part of mac air 15 reviews in apple event by Tim cook I thought u would mention about it Are u being humble
Apple welcome to Android C type
"It really seems like a halfstep forward Like there is USBC but no fast charging that will probably come out on the iPhone 16 So I would still wait one more year for them to figure stuff out Like there is no need to upgrade from an iPhone 12 Pro yet

The dynamic island is cool but its even more in your face So I would prefer to habe the old notch but with the functions of the d namic Island and I dont see why it shouldnt work and I cant believe that Apple would make me want to have the notch back "
Now that Apple has done it I can already see Oneplus switching to customizable button instead of their Iconic slider
USB 20 on type C is crazy
me watching with my iPhone 14 pro max and my Apple Watch ultra 
"I cant believe how many people are actually thinking about buying this phone like if you have the iphone 12 13 or 14 you literally dont need to get this its the same thing
In fact Im not just hitting on apple by saying this i am a note 20 ultra user and i am also not thinking of upgrading until i see actual innovation i ln phones otherwise Im thinking of buying a foldable Cz the rest are all just the same its become kinda boring you know what i mean"
Base iPad has it USB C already
"Ladies and gentlemen and everyone in between huge announcement Apple brings incredible new USB tech to their phone in 2023 that runs at unbelievable speeds
for people time traveling from the 90s because usb 2 has literally been around since the year 2000 

You cannot tell me that usb 3 is so much more expensive that Apple couldnt put it in there 600 devices in 2023"
Plz wallpaper link plzzzz
So the normal iPhone 15 is just a 14s with a different connector Nice Lets see next year what happens
USBC is absolute dogshit of a standard And world will be stuck in this dogshit for the next decade
It would have probably cost them nothing to put usb3 on the 15
Time to buy a used 14 pro max of someone as its just depreciated 
Every year the keep dishing out the same needed garbage and people keep buying it like drones
camp dont care
why does the glass break   no latest guerilla glass  Thats bad
Irrelevant all the airheads will buy it like theres no tomorrow Its not about features but about showing off
The entire event was pretty much a yawn but I will be picking up that natty titanium
The action button is interesting that you can change it but itll only have one action  Is there something like double press or triple press to launch a different command If it doesnt have I think its not that good 
455 did you just skip through the most exciting bit hardware accelerated raytracing by saying its not new Yes its new You can do it in software but its a slideshow Whats really exciting is that this means M3 lineup is sure to have big raytracing capabilities for 3D artists and gamers
Adding faster charging would take away from the brand new features of the iPhone 16
721 is mkb doing some conspiracy thing or just his ear itchy
Titanium is stronger Wtf Not really its softer
Apple just adapted to the current state of mess with USBC kabels and connectors Nobody can say for sure what does any of the USBC connectors support  USB 20  30 31 32  thunderbolt  alt mode video output  charging  Kudos to Apple to show people the mess the USBC is Dont get me wrong I like USBC when it is fully functional  charging USB 32 Gen 2 Thunderbolt charging  but that is not always the case Quite the opposite
The iphone14 only had like 5 extra features than the 13 the 15 is useless
Titanium is not stronger than steel but lighter Theyll for sure save some grams from that change and as long as it doesnt pump up the price it is welcome
Record on red cinematic camera 
"Great 
You are really one of the best reviewersYouTubers"
I am an android user for the past 6 years stopped having iPhone after my iPhone 6 But I do really just love to see and hear about these kind of tech invasions But I must say last years Apple event was a bit more interesting But cool that the base models now get the fancy new island
"I havent needed to plug my iphone in to transfer data in a decade Its just not something I think most iphone users do I would much rather have a smaller more robust connector and I fear thats what lighting was to usbc

The transfer speed and charging speeds were pretty irrelevant Convenient if I need it sure but I will rarely to never need it"
Having a glass behind aswell seems quite a dumb idea so u have basically almost 100 that if you drop ur phone something shatters
Tech is dead
OLED on the 15 is a big improvement over the LCD in the 14
So basically the same phone with USBC with no change in price Hmm
The baseline cheap iPad already has USB C 150
"Fast charging batteries is actually detrimental to their health Batteries have a C rating which is a charge rating and discharge rating

Ideally you want to charge your batteries at 1C which is 1 amp for every 1000 milliamp hours

 So these phones which have superfast charging actually charging the batteries either well beyond there recommended charging rate and therefore degrading the health which means lower battery life over time and the stating to rely more on the fast charging because you will need it when your battery life is only half of it true life because youve smashed it was super fast charging

I think Apple are prioritising battery health over fast charging due to previous issues and negative media about playing with the battery life"
"15 pro max pet peeves  slow wireless charging and over all charging is slownot superfast like other androids where u can charge whole phone in 30mins its 15w wiress for PM and 30w wired

no TB4 port wudda been amazing to see those 40gbs transfers  
is it confirmed we dont need MFI usbC cables we can reuse all our old android cables i have like 20 usbC cables lieing around"
Fast charge an usb 30 is a way to sell iphone 16 to the ones buying 15 otherwise they stop having breakthrough  tech to sell iphones to fanboys
"Ill wait till next year UNLESS the 3rd Party Apps Camera Problem is actually physical and can now access the close up camera on the iPhone 15 
Otherwise its a software glitch"
I really like the new colors of the regular iPhone 15 line but have been so used to ProMotion on the 14 Pro Max Its sad that they still use 60hz
I did the comparison between 14 pro and 15 both exactly the same Except charging port
Ive been sitting on iPhone X for a several years now I think iPhone 15 finally checks enough boxes to make me really consider upgrading this year
For the extortionate price for UK customers its not worth dropping that kind of money so Im sticking to the more honest price for Android so get lost Apple
I upgraded my phone from Iphone X to Iphone 13 pro and i am happy with it I am sure i am not even using this phone to its full potential  Not used the macro mode once for which it was praised at the time of launch so yeah  no upgrade for me this time
"Mkbhd admit it there is nothing new
The innovation has lost from apple"
Those milky colours are just bad They look kinda yuck Like milkshakes  Rose milk and pistachio milk and mango milk Dont like it at all
Heres hoping we get a new Magic Mouse with USBC charging that isnt on the bottom  So we can charge and still use the mouse  That was the dumbest designed decision ever
I was really looking forward to buying the iPhone 15 I wanted to jump from Pixel to Apple as I had only a brief affair with the iPhone 6S Everything looks great but the phonebase model costs around 1100 USD in Poland Big nope for me
I am surprised you didnt dis them at all saying all these few things are just something thats not worth making a video about
as a person who was diagnosed legally blind and uses the magnifyer almost every day im out i trully appreciate apples decision to allow us to open the magnifyer with the new buttonthe amount of times i tripple taped the lock button to bring up my wallet and instead opened my magnifyer or vice versa is like 80 of the time
I like iPhones but 60Hz is a no go
Ive spent a long time looking forward to the release of the iPhone 15 expecting Apple to do something big Its fair to say this entire event was a let down The biggest change is moving to USBCwhich they were forced to do Guess Ill have to wait for a real change with the iPhone 20 
Im upgrading from my iPhone 14 pro max 1tb to iPhone 15 pro max 1tb
You forgot to thank EU for that USBC  D
So a fairly incremental upgrade from the 14 and 14 pro
Im still using an iPhone 10 I had been planning to get a 14 last year but after they were announced the upgrade just didnt seem worth it then But after five years the 10 is starting to show its ageshort battery life sluggish face recognitionso I went ahead today and preordered a 15 with 256 gigs It felt very costly I live in Japan and the weak yen has made all imports more expensive I hope the 15 lasts five years too
"Dead innovation same old looking phone time to skip
Wait for raidcal new design"
Good riddance to the lightning cable Apple putting profits over the environment and created a solo use cable purely to make money when they were already making billions Sad the EU had to force them to move but glad it was done
Isnt usbc only there because the EU demanded that they change that if they want to sell their phones in Europe
If I compare my iPhones 11 and 15 only change I can see from daily use prospective is USBC rest are still the same with very minor changes
Looking forward to MKBHD replacing Tim Cook when the time arrives
At first I was underwhelmed but then I realised these were solid upgrades especially to the base iPhone Dynamic island USBC and the new portrait mode plus the 2x zoom are all great features The Pro improvements seem less meaningful unless you need that 5x zoom Very disappointing that Pros dont get Thunderbolt and USB2 speeds on the base iPhone is just silly There was no reason to hold that back other than to sell next years model
The whole point of USBC is fast throughput and fast charging Apple will never innovate
This iPhone 15 is soo disappointing Basically nothing new except the new 3um chip which not many people will notice
Am happy I shifted to S23 ultra while my Iphone 13 could still fetch a great resale price
Im getting one this is the year I upgrade my Xs Max
Can the action button be customised to do different actions when in different focus modes
Dont care  all
Im in the camp of watching the reviews to see whether its really worth it
Ah yes the same phone again
Think Ill be happy w my IPhone 13 for another year or so lol
A poor first impression in my opinion The biggest new feature of the iPhone 15 Pro is the new GPU that Apple is utilizing Apple stands to significantly change the mobile games space by bringing parity between console and mobile games for the first time Bring on Assassins Creed Mirage and Resident Evil 4
THE ONE PIECE IS REAL
apple NEVER made an iphone more repairable theyre doing everything software and hardwarewise to avoid repair im a bit disappointed of your statement havent you heard of the newesr apple pencil thing
Nothing newand interesting in the phone industry Ive definitely lost interest in these launches
Not just usb c Also button
I guess theyve got enough going on with the XR headset this iPhone is kind of boring
Apple added a bixby button lmaooooooo 
"One for the customer on his digital throne
In the Lands of Europe where the Rules lie
One Port to rule them all One Port to find them
One Port to bring them all and in the universalism bind them
In the Lands of Europe where the Rules lie"
not necessarily a bad thing personally i think it is necessarily a bad thing lol
Great se same exact  o great USB c 
if they have changed the charger than they should provide a charger in the box isnt it 
Just a scam dont buy it
Dont believe a word this guy says All optionsthoughtsfake concerns are paid for
Apple event was really embarrassing  You know they dont have any new stuff when they spent 13 of the presentation telling how carbon neutral they are
So for someone who is not a photographer and the main use of my phone is not for the camera there is absolutely zero reason to upgrade Great review as always maybe Im missing something but in a whole year they add a button and change the charging cable The rest is nonsense
I think 12  is a option for those who takes a lot of documents photos close up but due to current 1x they have to take those pictures in 2x to get a clean detailed pic
"I havent had an iPhone since the 5s Ideally I want to wait to see the reviews first but am I the only one that even tho I want the pro max the 5x zoom bumps me cause I want that iconic portrait 3x zoom that the iphones are known for Also Im curius to see the prices in Greece
Lastly I want the apple watch 9 in the stainless steel version soooo bad but in Greece we only have the aluminum version"
Apple was pushed into USBC by Europe to still be able to sell in the market at the same rate and they had to comply Apple took a shot by changing it to USBC but intentionally made one a 20 which I dont feel is as popular as 30 Kind of trifling but I cant say I am so surprised I still feel that Apple is trying to pass off basic product enhancements as upgrades Not good The last iPhone I purchased was the 8
Cant wait to get this in 2027
I didnt see any major upgrade aside from the new charging port Hahaha
Dont know why no one talks about the 60Hz display that is in the 15 and 15 plus which costs around 800 dollars Also will that dynamic island features be soomther and fluid like the pro bodels with 120 Hz promotion display
Also they didnt mention or I missed but pro models will have WiFi 6E
Im sorry I dont understand iPhone news unless its in inspirational song form
Im getting the 15 Pro Max for sure
Im dumping all my Apple shares after viewing their IPhone 15 podcasts
That action button animation is better than what One UI 6 is offering
60 hz still for the 799 they just own us with no innovation at this point
Testing
Apple didnt explain the voice isolation feature  strange
CorrectNot Friends Android to be charged by Iphone cable But Friends Android Charger CAN BE use for charging Iphone
Samsung better
what about the new apple watch is it worth it
iPhone sucks
its trash lol
60Hz refresh rate screen in 800 phone is just absurd Either I need to buy 15 Pro to get a feature that already exists for years in 250 Android phones or I need to wait one more year to replace my iPhone 11 with iPhone 16
I think my iPhone 12 can still last a couple years even with them releasing usb c
Just such a shame that the presentations from Apple have become so poor The 15 Pro is a worthy device but so much hype and oversell in those glitzy announcements They now come across as totally unreal and false I much preferred the live stage presentations  warts and all
Europe wins usbc Lol
yeah i have the 14 pro max and i wont be upgrading although having usb c is nice i think ill wait until i notice an actual difference or wait for the 16
Crazy how they quoted you in the event and u still on they ass cuz they coulda done better I love to see it
I will say my samsung s22 supports 45 watt charging but it only charges my phone to 100 about 8 minutes faster than my 25 watt charger Its not ground breaking So if the i phone would get 25 watt charging it should be acceptable
Skip this and get the iPhone 16 surely
that feeling when you see MKBHD quote in Apple KeyNote
How does an iphone in 2023 still run at 60hz
Thank you Considering getting the phone only to give my current iPhone 13 Pro Max to my gf May think about it because of the new charger I have so many lighting cables 
"The lack of fast charging is quite a deal breaker for me I tend to be on the go quite often and only have a small amount of time to charge my phone I really want to move to the iPhone to improve my workflow in ways android cannot but apple is making it difficult

And the upload speed is also a major disappointment for me even on the pro"
Its literally iPhone 14 but with USBC and a new button
"well i can see how for the small iphone the dynamic island make sense but in case of a pro max to reach up there you need really big hands
i mean i have a size 910ish and use 66inch phones all the time but even i make sure to have all the stuff i use is in the lower two 3rds of the screen so thus they are effortless to reach
and i know many people who have medium hands but still buy big phones they want the best camera system so they buy the flagship which is usually the biggest in the line up so they set up their phones for best user experience for their hand size but for them  this dynamic island is not useful at all except if the phone is on the table then its a usable thing for all"
615 That will be the next years update
Love it but Im staying with my 12
Fast charging to come in iPhone 16 
usbc is the only new feature worth upgrading for if you have an old phone I personally like the feature but since i already have my cables and my stuff i dont see the benefit of it just yet
Ill wait until next year but yeah happy we will be able to charge everything with the same cables now
"Spatial Video is not being talked enough about 

It is a vastly underrated feature Can you imagine recording your childs first steps and reliving them years later How about a marriage proposal That would be an emotional landmark I would definitely want to record moments with my parents who are old Even after theyre gone I would feel their presence albeit digitally But it would be as close as I could get to being with them This feature is going to change the way we store memories digitally"
watching this knowing dang well im going to stick with my iphone 8 pluse
Guys I wanted to change the world see the new horizon BE the new horizon I wanted to change the phone industry and be the change So I introduce the iPhone 14 with a USBC charging port
Its only me or you see that almost every person of images on apple presentation is black
USB C is definitely a step back Lightning was so much better 
Android using c port and reverse charging from last 8 years and its old technology now  and 5x zoom technology is what is it in my previous lifewhats new is price
Very hard to switch once you are used to Galaxy Fold 5 Hope Apple is watching this space
Can I have Samsung Galaxy s 23 ultra please 
Watching it on my 13PM with 99 battery life after 1 year Im staying on it for another year not worth upgrading
"You know a phone is packed with Innovation when the biggest news is a port change  D

This is peak stagnation for Apple"
Same as iPhone 14 Pro
If an Android phone released where the only change on it was the charge port it would get cancelled But cause its Apple its revolutionary 
This phone is boring Always same
Some android companies have made their usb c accessories to only work with their phone good luck trying to charge anything else
Tech Youtuber Who Says Straight Most Genuine About Products 
Apple came long way quoting youtuber for validation 
they couldve put thunderbolt speeds on the pro line like the ipad pro and the normal iphone will get the usb 3 speeds
Does it still work with mag safe wireless charging
I think the way I knew it was only really going to be the usb c stuff was them spending the first 10 minutes only talking about the most basic tech specs of usb c and the eco friendly stuff Its like why are we spending half a tech show overall about how eco friendly you are Just tell us about tech and maybe give a quick run down of how eco friendly
I imagine theyll bring fast charge next year Gotta have something new for the 16 right
Tim Cook PRO
All this means is that samsung will not be doing anything crazy for their 24 
Its fucking nuts that I got the 14 pro max and Im probably going to get the 15 pro max an Im gonna lie to myself an say well itll be easier to have just one cable to rule them all an In hindsight I think I should at least wait til the 16 ultra 
Hhy do the better camera matter at this point other than RAW stuff to movies ect  you cant upload anything on any platform without the quality do a nosedive
Not that 60hz displays are bad but its shocking Apple still gets away with it at 799 In my country India 90hz is a must feature for any phone more than 200
So were really ignoring the fact that in 2023 going into 2024 the base iPhones still have 60hz panels How did they get a pass Id really love to know
Ive been waiting for this but feel a little underwhelmed
"Im in the camp of I cant afford it at all
"
Now that they are USBC I am actually thinking of switching My Pixel 7 is great but honestly the fact that literally everyone I know has an iPhone I feel like it would just be easier to switch
I upgrade phone regularly on my 2 year cycle Im not over the moon about the 15 but it will be a welcome upgrade from my 13 pro max
Last year Ive switched 13 Pro to S23 Ultra and results was amazing UI experience better than expected oh cameras was unbelievable I also sold my apple watch 7 sick and tired of charge the watch every day and now I am using Huawei watch gt3 pro which takes far less 20 days to re charge I was a Iphone user almost 10 years but when I see nothing change no fast charge no new tech Throw all numbers to user to make yourself make something instead of doing new Im out from apple and the people think to do that just do  Saying hi from the most expensive Iphones in the world which Iphones starts from 2413  in Trkiye
Upgraded camera and USB C Real innovation fr
In Sweden the 15 Pro Max is 1600 usd with taxes climate addons n such slick 
finally my iphone 8 can be retired to ipod status
I see a Fuji GFX 100 mark 2 in Davids hands review on the studio channel 
finally we can put google assistant
Titanium is softer than steel it will dent more
Now I have zero respect for Apple for having USBC 
"Keynotes these days
1 Our cameras do this one slight thing better than the last which YOU WILL NEVER EFFING NOTICE

2 Our transistors have gotten smaller to house a few X more billions which YOU WILL NEVER NOTICE OR CARE ABOUT

3 Our performance is X times better which you WILL NEVER NOTICE OR CARE ABOUT

4 Our battery lasts some random amount lets say 4 times what it did previously which you MIGHT notice or MIGHT NOT

5 Our phones are now made with X material now instead of Y   which you WILL NOT NOTICE  AND NOT CAREE ABOUT

6 Our phones used to break when dropped from 5 feet now they would break when dropped from 10

End of
Same for android and same for iphone
wtf is wrong with the end consumers these days Its just fluff folks Use your hardearned money for something that adds real value to your lives"
pretty dope that theyre titanium now kind of indifferent about usbc excited to see test footage of the new telephoto prism Overall Ill still hang on to my 12 pro max lmao
Sadly pro motion is not extended to the plus side But with the promodels  definitely it eyeing for gamers interest to run games that run on console to run on mobile
There is no major difference between iphone 15 and 14 apart from a freaking port says a lot about the beating Apple is getting from its android competitors dont know why anyone would waste their money on a iPhone 15 pro
Apple should realize that most of their users are shallowminded They will only upgrade if there is a significant cosmetic design change that will distinguish it from the previous generation The 14 series generation for example saw 67 and 60 sales increase respectively vs 13 and 12 series
The sheep will love it
Finally Marcus has uploaded 
Lackluster products and complete absence of innovation from Apple since Tim Cook became CEO Getting worse year by year Ten years from now the only new thing Apple is able to announce in a product launch is a new name for the product Pathetic Tim Cook should just resign before this circus gets even more obnoxious than what it is now
horrible its a faster iPhone 14 with USBC where is Apples creativity
Help I have the 12 pro max but I feel theyre all the same I just dont have the island and always on screen Should I upgrade or wait till the 16
Oh my GOD USBC  Come on Innovation 
watching this video in broken screen 
Team I was looking to upgrade my iPhone and now I am dissapointed that the new one brings absolutely nothing new to the table
I agree Screen cover should also be titanium 
Ive had the XR since 2019 and was contemplating getting 14 pro max but Ill wait to see your review on the 15 pro max
Still waiting for the removable battery model
Sweet show of Fujifilms new GFX100 ii camera at 1106
"Iphones have always sucked and they always will compared to Android
And the dynamic island has to be the worst ever excuse to keep the horrible notch thats even bigger now to take up screen space Such garbage trash phone I go with Android anyday"
The same thing
I saw a screenshot that said something like  Android cable detected
I use the 12 pro max  been 3 years already my main camera doesnt work well and both glasses are broken what makes more sense fixing it or getting the 15 pro max
I have the classic 13 and it doesnt change a thing 2 gen later except dynamic island also a lot of people telling they dont use it that much so nothing There is no more breaking news like touch id 3d touch face id full screen like whats apple doing at this point Can i have a real NEW Iphone
A wise man once said Humpe Toh Hai He 9
Would you recommend getting iPhone 15 or iPhone 14 Pro
Very disappointing launch honestly by apple Literally nothing new of note
I watch Apple events now for mostly the comedy How they managed to make an entire event around such innovative features like USBC dynamic notch and a button with a straight face and present it like the second coming of Christ is beyond me
I think it would be even more interesting once you review Mate 60 Pro
I actually prefer lightning Aesthetic and heritage
"So pretty much only a new usbc port and new colors
For only 1000 dollars more 
Apple are a joke
Why do ppl buy this bullshit"
And they still havent removed the notch Lazt apple as always
Am I the only disappointed in what Apple has presented Same phone new chip which they could have introduced last year but since theres no innovation this year they just held back on it I get that the celling of smartphones has been reached for the most part but there is still so much we can achieve with the watches
Fast charging will be next years pro phone big upgrade
Still satisfied with my Pixel 6a If it aint broke dont fix it 
Or you can charge your iphone from your DellLenovo notebook USBC PD power supply that you have to use for work
Very boring event
The iPhone has had fast charging with usb c for years marques You can charge an iPhone in like 40 minutes with a usbc fast charging brick already Surprised you didnt know that
"iPhone users dont have any Android friends 
How comes video title wasnt iPhone  theyve settled "
Such small changes on the hardware side This is why people buy phones less and hang onto their  old ones because theyre good enough and havent changed enough to drop another 1k
Definitely in camp dont care at all but it is interesting to see that once again the biggest thing a new iPhone has is something my Android phones have had for at least 5 or 6 years ie USB C 
Tim Cook must be watching This and patting himself on the back Tim Cook is the worst thing that ever happened to Apple
Looking forward to setting up the programmable button to bring up calculator
Such a pity the new iPhone 15 range of smartphones wont have fast charging and backtoback wireless charging like Samsung smart phones have
The most this could have been an email launch event ever
So  is the typeC port gonna support 35mm headphones now with adapter just like android  
Not just usb c Its also 1 gram lighter  Apple is one of the biggest grifters around lmao
Really tired to see the same design again  again  again
Been waiting for this to come out since my iPhone X battery is finally crapping out 5 years later After watching several vids though I might just get the 15 plus or wait a little longer until the 14 pros come down a little in price and go that route I dont need professional photographer level pictures and pretty much anything will be a massive upgrade over my old phone
Will get one nevertheless and try
i chocked a lil when they mentioned it was an all new design
After all these years Apple is giving type C but with no fast charging because of course they did that
Trash S update
Its time to move on from Apple 
So how is this basically NOT just type C
Its crazy how the iphone will support video out through usb c before the google pixel
It really took courage for Apple  for them to move to USB C 
USBC Thank you European Union 
It seems to me that the NON Pro version of the current year is the PRO version of the previous one Which is great
The titanium edge is not as glossy as the stainless steel
Thanks European Union for USBC Too few places fail to mention that Apple was forced into this and its not some feature they brought on their own account Also remember when they stopped including chargers in the box because everyone has a few at home Well now that the ports have changed what is the explanation
Pretty sure we dont support ANKER
"android to apple  ohh USB type C 
what a innovation"
"USBC because the EU demanded it
Its that simple"
Is it just me or is apple like joe Biden you cant believe anything apple say or do
The quickest way to the bottom of the barrel
Great  Iphone
The 15 is just usb c The pro and the pro max are the upgrade if you can call them that 
Guys  really  really  Usbc is there only because EU legislation forced them to change it  How anyone can appraise this  and call it upgrade when on other phones its standart for years   Apple simply sucks and its way behind competition 
Ive been holding on to my iPhone 11 Pro for a few years now so I think this will be the one I wish they had better colors for the 15 pro though
Wow I wish Android with change to type C 
Seems to me the way Apple has worded things You can film 4k 60fps ProRes but only if you plug in an external hard drive Can someone confirm
Waiting for It
what is new then nothing it a shame phone again and price is higher than ever
Im perplexed with the 15 Not really impressed and they seem to be giving you less and charging more for the phone  I need to upgrade from my iPhone X original but I cant believe Im saying this but I might get better value from an S23 based model then the 15 pro  I think the iPad are still the best but when it comes to phones I appreciate a company that gives you the best bang for your buck  Thats my 2 cents
Im wondering if they can still give a customizable action switch for the iPhone 15 with less options  Great video as usual Looking forward to the full review
I think I am not impressed this year If they brought the zoom to the non Pro max and it was x10 zoom reverse charging on the back of the phone and for charging a friends dead iPhone would have complimented the new name drop feature very well an actual USBC explanation would have been nice and more features to the Dynamic Island would have been nice too
an important think I miss from this impressions the new configurable button is mean to handle just one thing at a time i mean no doble click for a different function or short press or something
This mans so unbiased
So the extra button on the side its the Bixby button so much hated years ago but bit redefine no
"Itll never happen but the wildest thing Apple could do would be to not release a new band of phones every year Releasing new phones every other year could be dressed up as saving the planet reducing consumerism for the good of the people or any other Apple spin 
It also means when they do release something itll blow the pants off of the market IMO"
I have a iPhone 7 Plus these features always have looked cool but I dont really need it The only downside I have right now is storage Only have 32 gigs
Voice memo from action button is purely made for spys
The audio shift in this video is a bit annoying
The headlining new feature is usb c SNOOZE FEST
damnit apple this pisses me off still no fast charging let us all remind Tim Cook very Boldy Its 2023 no more slim picking apple yep marques just did a dope class A apple call out 
Thanks for the video whatever happened to were running out of resources to produce electronics and semiconductors Yet every year we get millions of phones from all the manufacturers with incremental upgrades at best for more money SMH
Ive been on my 12 pro max for nearly 3 years and I think the baseline 15 will be just plenty Dont care for the huge screen anymore and the camera was already good on the 12 pro so Phones have gotten so good that its harder and harder to really wow people and much easier for consumers to wait for a reasonable upgrade Which is really a good thing if you think about it environmentally And as the environmental impact was a great focus in yesterdays launch I think being a bit underwhelmed with new launches is actually really good Gets you really thinking is it actually necessary to switch to a newer model or is it just because
How did you not mention Spacial Video
still using my X with its original battery I was determined to switch for the pro this year but after watching the event Im not so sure anymore might just wait for the 16 pro
Coming from a 12 pro max im def preordering the 15 pro max Sept 15th lol regardless of what ppl who have the 14 are saying
I currently have the 14 pro and though not necessarily necessary Im going to upgrade just because of the USBC All of my tech uses USBC so one less cable to worry about is worth it to me Also my phone is in perfect condition and if I can get a good trade in value then Im all game
Still have a 12 Pro Every new phone since has not been anything great and convincing me to buy a new one The 15 pro is same storyAs for the Apple eventboring as hell Someone needs to teach them how to make an event engaging It was painful Tim you may love the camera but the camera dont love you
Yep still keeping my iPhone 11 Pro
My 5 year old Note9 has a Bixby button you can reassign as an action button
The USB C is because of European Union legislation Apple didnt want to do it but they were forced to
Cannot afford an iPhone but its still interesting
What about battery capacities
Its the most underwhelming jump from Apple A new commonsense charging port a harder lighter frame and minor tweaks inside clothed in tech jargons The iPhone has peaked Might be good for first time buyers or those upgrading from the 13 lineup otherwise its not worth an upgrade for iP14 users
Is it really worth it to upgrade when theres nothing much of an upgrade from the previous 2 models
"I wonder what 
Contract  like"
Shout out to EU who made it possible in iphones USB C port 
Should I buy iPhone 15 pro 128gb or 256gb Im not someone who upgrade every year Maybe about 3 or 4 years then I will consider Probably use for playing video games and a little bit of photo Any suggestions
Absolutely nothing to make me consider upgrading from my 13  Were on our 5th iteration of folding phones  This is a disappointing update  Still sitting here with my apple watch 7 waiting for a reason to be excited  Apple is being shown up by Samsung
Not at all redundant brand iPhone is what it is
with USBC can we now connect to directly to external drives without any special cables or stupidly pricey special hard drives
USB C Only reason Im getting one
Wallpaper of the iPhone in the videos cover
Waiting for its comparison with the S23 ultra
In for the 14 pro
"Is there any reason to Apple choosing to go with USB 20 released in the year 2000 before the iPhone even existed or before USB C even existed on the nonpro models
Or is this Apples way of saying We were forced by the EU governments to give you this slower USB C port to make it seem that Apple has superior tech 

I mean if they wanted they could go with USB 32 which has a data transfer speed of 20Gbps 25GBps which would move those 10 minute 80GB files from phone to other devices in about 40 seconds versus the  USB 20 which will take 318 hours to complete"
Its easy to be scooped up in the Apple euphoria Type C USB dedicated button different colors new materialYou could almost be forgiven for not knowing a lot of these upgrades have been available on other devices for yearsApple are trickle feeding what users actually want to extend  maximize profits Youll still need two cables unless youre gonna get rid of your perfectly good AirPods
Quite disappointed wished there was more innovation Maybe I have too much expectation
I was waiting for the USB C thats the only new thing on the iPhone
Apple Iphones are sooo boring  nothing special
"It took 10 years to implement USB C on iphone

Pathetic


Still iddiots will praise Apple"
Waited d for your review 
Man I hope they can make another mini I know they didnt sell well but I still want a new one
ive still got the 12 pro every year I say if its worth it ill take it every year I realise theres not much of a difference Id want in my new phone This year seems the same tbh the only diff from 12 pro and 15 pro that i could even think of that id want is the dynamic island But i can wait another year if it means a huge change from what i currently have
"This is a scam and we all should protest in every way possible for this scam to end They bring nothing new to the table these upgrades are not worth mentioning and here you have a youtuber that is paid from Apple to talk good about a thing that clearly is the same product as the older one 
Boo this man"
iPhone 14 USB C
I suppose objective reviews have now gone out of fashion
 Android Gang We Up the New Eyephone is Mediocre as always 
This phone can run GTA 5 Natively Get ready for ultimate Handled gaming experience
Plus pathetic have do credit checks now never had do that when had my iPhone 12 even on benefits whatever you recieve still have do it check my records on what I spend talk bout lengthy contracts
I just need that spatial vidoe
I think Ill stick with my iPhone 14 pro max
Gonna be my next phone once I get to preorder it
I have been waiting for new phone release so i could afford old phone
Lol USBC was not Apples amazing idea to have all iphones rocking this nowThe EU forced this onto Apple
good
Does anyone know if the new pro models coming with 8gb of ram
Is the pro still going to be at 6gb of RAM
I am definitely getting the 15 Pro Max this year Coming from a 12 Pro now seems a good year to upgrade Most important reasons for me so vs my current 12pro being USBC obviously pro motion dynamic island 5x photo  customizable action button titanium ill go for natural color
So were just gonna ignore the fact that they gave you a shoutout
Sad to see Anker returning as a sponsor after that eufy thing
I feel like mapping a shortcut for recording police stops will be a good use of the new Action button Saves having to say Hey Siri
All the dumb iPhone buyers finally get a bone with usb c cause common sense wasnt in thought when they went to that lightning  overpriced rip off of trash
them finally adapting to the usb c environment got me so good
watching this on my iPhone xr
Arent people sick of buying an over priced phone that looks basically the same for the last 4 generations
Loliphone
Well  bummer Thanks Europe though
I was about to start my Eulogy for my grandpa but that Red Arrow in the thumbnail captivated me so much that I just had to click on this
Now waiting on s24 Samsung 
Not Buying Iphone 15 button
 Dude i legitly sat down waiting on your review
"Includes USB C
doesnt include fast charging

Apple being pointless as always"
Why do I feel like Im being ripped off even though I am not  its like being taken for granted
Apple would probably never do this but it would have been cool to see them integrate a little light inside the new action button that would change to match whatever you set it to in the settings
They should hold off from making new phone until their hologram calling is ready and the super VR capabilities
goat tuber
Bro the level of bias towards apple is becoming embarrassing Imagine if this was Samsung or any android company had the same run as apple with little to none improvement over the years you can imagine the level of criticism Call it for what it is  Marques for once call it as it is
Fooling people to buy an iPhone 14 with USB port Still dont understand the craze
S23 ultra R U L Z 
Props to bro for trying to make it seem interesting
Cheap Ipad
"Use wireless 
Gonna see 

Can try 
Get iPhone 14 
On contract my 12 faulty now 
Had 3yrs anyway dont want use it"
Same old outdated design Its better to get a samsung
007 Spatial Video Marques has had the 15 for days 
Apple 15 will make to able a call Source Trust me bro
huawei comeback
"I think the base iPhone 15 is a good deal for those waiting to upgrade from iPhone 1112
Significantly better chip good camera and USBC"
Cryphone 15epic fail
Nothing announced made me consider giving up the mighty iPhone 13 mini Theyll have to work harder yet to get me to switch
So its an iPhone 14 with a usb c
How do you toggle silent mode if you switch the new Action Button to do something else 
"Its stupid lighting better 
Way faster anyway"
I will be waiting for your extremely detailed video analysis of the features of 15 models on all specs
iPhone 15 60 Hz display again 
iPhone 15 15plus and 15p 15pmis really boring
I really dont think that anyone should switch to iPhone 15 from a 14 the changes that they announced are basically mostly software The usbc change was absolutely needed and Im glad that they finally did thanks to EU Regulations
Can you only map one action to the new action button For instance I think it would be cool if you could press once and it does X press twice and it does Y press and hold and it does Z
Iphones easy to lowbat and takes too long to full charge  What a cringe phone  
Same old stuff
"I have the 14 Pro Max and had the 13 Pro Max prior there really wasnt a reason to upgrade In fact the 14 Pro Max battery life is worse
This time I will wait for full reviews before deciding on an upgrade"
Laziest launch ever Everybody waiting to upgrade will wait for another year While Samsung Google is killing with Fold AMD NVIDIA rocking with Datacentre chips Apple is seriously lacking in innovation
I only wish they didnt replace mute switch with action button I like that they made it customiseable but I just wish they kept it in the same form as it used to be it was just cool to have the switch next to all the buttons
wait till next year i think haha
104 instert DJ Khalid pointing
Its a snoreathon nothing ever excites anyone unlike the early 2000s The last time I went Oh Wow I need to get that was the first iPad Air in 2013
"I really dont like this design for the cameras that apple has introduced since iphone 11reminding of an oven still waiting for them to come up with something new designwise
I didnt want to believe the rumorsmockups and was wishing they would surprise us with something totally different for the phonecamera design for at least one of the 4 models
I have an iphone 13 and I see a lot of people having iphone 13s and 14s around like the average buyer who buys the standard model why would want to upgrade if the design is almost identical if you put a case on you wont notice a difference between 131415 except for the dynamic island and specwise the improvements are minor for the average user
The dynamic island and the minor camera improvements wont make most of people with 13 and 14 want to upgrade to 15
I dont know if its Apple not making innovations anymore with her phones or the fact that the smartphones in general have reached a quality standard that doesnt take further improvement to perfection especially in a single year
The cameras the last 3 years almost compare to DSLRs and the recent chips are still too powerful to handle anything so in my opinion only big brand fans would want to upgrade to keep up with the latest model"
Im gonna wait until you let me know if its worth upgrading from the 12 mini
You fools the will upgrade USBC speeds and charging power  in the NEXT IPHONE MUAHAHAHAHA
In India 15 pro starts from 1600 and base 15 from 965
all of a sudden the SAMSUNG GALAXY FOLD AD made this whole video hilarious Haha
Please can you buy me an iphone I am an IndianPlease can you buy me an iphone I am an Indian
I want a future proof phone but I am getting the latest one every year haha
Just wanna know that is the ultra wide of 15 base is good enough or still suck doing the job
again im seeing literal death threats from android users towards apple users even if they say they cant afford a new phone to begin with i really dont think ill be switching over to android just out of respect for myself and others and to prevent supporting this disgusting behaviour
I feel like when ever Apple raise the bar in terms of good stuff they also raise it in terms of disappointment Yes you have USBC but you dont have fast charge Yes you get the dynamic island on the base iPhone 15 but were still selling you a phone without high refresh rate in 2023 Its never all you want
Marques is really trying a lot to speak about this little changes which apple made in these new models and try to sound like Wow
they talk about better repairfriendly design but never talk about software serialization to these so repiairable iphones
as someone who uses iphone 13 for 2 years i dont see any reason to upgrade to iphone 15 i might think going back to android
Thats all cosmetic upgrades but not productive one another expensive lollipop for apple customers 
USBC required MFI to get iphone full functions
"iPhone is lazy and milks your money methodically I know your doing your job propping them up as much as you can but Androids are where its at and its sad that gen Z will spend over 1000 on the new iPhone every year just so they feel like they look cool having the newest iPhone We live in a pretty pathetic time right now where having the newest iphoneis a status thing Actually invest your money on something that matters and stop trying to impress people unless you just need a new phone then get a new phone But please understand that iPhone has been playing you for years and every year you fall for the you have to have the new iPhone thing
LAST THING please understand people phones can only advance so much to the point where phones are virtually the same year after year Youre basically wasting money at this point getting a new phone year after year instead of every couple years or so"
I wanna buy the pink iphone but im a boy 
I care not at all about usb c Never plug the phone in The decreased weight is what I care about most It will massively improve my experience with the iPhone As its been just unreasonably heavy in the Pro models
48mp camera is not from iphone 14 pro  pixel senzor size is biger  brighter
"WOWWWW USB CCCCCCCCCCCC

Who could have thought of this earlier way to go apple"
I guess I know why apple add a pro to their new chip Theyll gonna put the non pro version on iPhone 16 In just 3 to 4 generations they managed to complete the transfer from normal  iPhone having the same chip as the pro ones to using a weakened last gen chip on the normal iPhone
Being able to shoot 3D video for the new headset  enough reason for anyone to buy the 15 Pro Max    because content for the Vision Pro will drive sales for that device hopefully dropping the price in a few years and I want one damnit  EERrr one of each
will apple bring the Potrait mode camera features to the iphone 14 pro max
13 pro max is it worth the upgrade to 15 pro max in the uk and watch series 8 to series 9 is it worth the upgrade too
I will spend my money to buy Lego  UCS Venator and Lego UCS Razor Crest instead of buying this year Foolish Pro stuff
Who else saw the POV from tiktok
I have an XR and wanted to upgrade to the new 15 later this year to have a nice new phone with the latest stuff but after the key note I wonder if I should just save money and get a 14 pro since the difference doesnt seem significant enough for someone who uses their phone casually like me So Im in the middle where I want to see if the features turn out to be worth it
I wait for 16 pro because is not a big change
Totally underwhelmed What about us visually impaired people Never any new features for me We dont care about screens and camera I was hoping for some quad speakers or something at least
definitly a not game changer
Same old story I cant justify upgrading a good iPhone 11 to this
iphone 15 is a flop
I have a 13 Pro Max and I was told that this year was going to be an Amazing time to update any iPhone you may have had including last years phone I am about as excited about these features as I am of getting pulled over for excessive speeding Last week Samsung was offering a huge discount on the iPhone 13 or 14 pro max at the same price if you traded in your iPhone and bought the Samsung S23 Ultra I knew I should have bought it iPhone always disappoints as usual with their minuscule updates and upgrades I will wait to get the new iPhone 25 when they get their together in 10 yrs I wish Elon Musk bought Apple instead of that useless company Twitter because he would make the batteries last a week or a month knowing him on 1 simple charge Anyway Im sure millions of people throw their hard earned money at Apple year after year for the slightest of upgrades to say that they now have the best phone on the planet that takes videos and pictures Id rather pay a few hundred dollars more and get the best photos in the industry and that would be hands down SONY Well I too got suckered into buying the iPhone but I honestly dont see all the hoopla there is in owning using or bragging about these phones are Enjoy your new phones every 365 days boys
I wanna welcome every iPhone user to the year 2015 
Ngl pretty disappointing I expected more this year
My Samsung s8 has USBC  with fast charging and a customizable action button too I didnt know iPhone users didnt have this before
fast charging will be the next feature in the iPhone 15S Pro
Does the new pro phone support displaylink or desktop through usb
Phones are getting boring 
It was not touched on in the video but its very disappointing that ann 800 and 900 phone still comes with a 60Hz display Also the USB 20 speeds are just a dick move There are still huge files to move out of the base model iPhones and we are talking about a 10 yeah old tech cmon Apple
"Amazing  Thank you Marques for your great work  I have this question now as a filmmaker what shortage size is better for me  im between the 1 TB and the 512 also im considering that most of the time im planning to use the external hard drive and im still not sure  any advise here 
Thanks "
"Apple  Hey guys This the BRAND NEW iPhone It REALY IS BRAND NEW NOT just the same bits honest Well except we were FORCED to do USB C but as you know us well do USB C OUR WAY 
Most others WITH a brain  Yeah OK Apple 
"
"i want to ask something 
i buyed my iphone 14 plus 256  gb
at april 
should go for iphone 15 plus or pro or my 14 plus is better 
can anyone help me"
Zero interest
For the USBC port Yay 
"Apple USB3 has much higher speeds than USB2
USB4 Am I a joke to you"
its ridiculous how they turned a notch the size of a small country into a feature not even mentioning 60hz in 2023I dont get how people buy the BS
They really just put a usb c on it and said heres iPhone 15
Looks like apple is preparing to integrate more with android software
Its been 5 years and they still havent fixed the PWM and Temporal Dithering Joke
The camera gimmicks need more talk they act like they have multiple focal lengths when in reality they have multiple crops which is a totally different thing Again they confuse customers who know nothing about cameras and act like they have some magic in there they dont They dont even provide the sensor size which is the most important thing for cameras I dont like the intentional misinformation by Apple If you have a 15 crop shortcut name it that dont name it 35mm its not a 35mm lens stop wrong advertisement
Team pixel 
For a 13 mins video 3 ads Unreal
i am android fan but after seeing apple usb c and these changes i just hope that next iphone will have more android features and at that time when i feel like my samsung s22 plus is not good anymore i will considor buying iphone
forgot to mention the most unique thing about the Pros  the ability to film spatial video in the future which will be a big deal once vision pros come out
What computer did you edit this video on
Bummer for  the charging speed and  typical iphone it has proprietary cord needed Cant just use your android type c cable
Marques talking 13 minutes about changes and new features is somewhat  more impressive than what the whole new iphone lineup offer
being sponsored by the company that violate user privacy with their cameras and then lied about it is a really bad look  enough so for an unsubscribe
Come on dont let Anker sponsor you
Telling iPhone features but giving Samsung adds 
Wait for your full review  You can take your time with it But I do have have to say The most interesting thing about the iPhone this year is the fact that they are taking gaming more seriously So know imagine Great camera Great chip for gaming All that is left it Fast charging and wireless charging Then I could comeback to apple
Ceramic shield is a complete lie lol I had the 12 and 14 pro max and they easily get scratch and micro scratches
iPhone 15 the last phone but newer And the phone before that and that last one too and so on
Do we know if Iphone 15s will have SIMs for Europe
Funny thing i get samsubg fold ads in btw the video
Apple is like  the groundbreaking technology introducing the brand new most advance charging in the world the USBC
As much as I dislike Apple bad experiences w android phones are starting to push me in the iOS direction and its undeniable their tightly integrated hardware and software makes for a generally better experience across the board The one dealbreaker for me has always been the stupid lightning connector If my Pixel 7 Pro continues to be a messy buggy experience Ill likely begrudgingly switch to iPhone
I was hoping we would get 2TB internal storage as data gets bigger
that menu at 920 is such ridiculous overkill what the hell what happened to the humble dropdown control
Currently have a 12 pro max so Im gonna do the trade in and get a 15 pro max
iPhone  is Next Nokia Mark my word It will disappear from the planet within the next 5 to 10 Years
"Great Base phones no fast charge tho wtf  old AF feeling pro phones such a disappointment minus the new camera modes good step in the right direction in a environmental way but still taking steps back overall 

So with the new action button

mfs are still years behind Androids had that double click for action on the power button for like 10 years now wake tf up Apple  "
No fast charging  are you kidding literally 2024 guys 
So we already know what iPhone 16 going to be good lord that is so boring
This iPhone is a joke 
"To summarize ip15 has a usb c And thats pretty much it 
They are very much capable of upgrading or making greater improvements but they are holding back due to marketing longevity Apple is just a league on their own when it comes to marketing that is where they excel they can sell a phone with a technology thats 5 yrs behind with a higher price so consumers will think its more premium"
This year Im officially joining the Apple ecosystem Cant be left behind with all these beautiful innovations
No Product Red iPhone
"The only WONDERLUST is wondering where all their ideas have gone to as they dont appear to have made a show this year
I have to get one upgrading from iPhone X but this year feels like just an S upgrade  for me there is practically no wow factor I keep my phones 5 years so a little disappointed to be stuck without any truly interesting or innovative new features USBC Meh Slight speed increases Expected New materials They had to justify something new
Cameras are STILL a bump
There is STILL a cutout in the screen
They STILL could have added a little thickness to the phone to improve battery life
They STILL havent increased charge speed
There is STILL no reciprocal wireless charging
I am only left wondering what will come next year instead and what I will have missed out on by having to upgrade this year"
I just want to see what the camera can do on the video recording side with the 5x lens
"Ive been on the 12 for 3 years now so Id said Id upgrade this year to a 15 Pro either way
And now Im quite happy with the changes I welcome the camera improvements and the action button Titanium is nice too
Only thing I dont like is once again the camera separation between Pro and Pro Max I am a small phone person but Apple is once again tempting me towards the bigger one and I hate that"
I love the 15 pro design And the colors  now i will just wait until someone do review on how it performs  hope there wont be any bug
usb2 and no fast change
I am sorry I had stop watching after 3 min Just a same phone
"Thumbs up for cosmetic repairability The rest feels like a slow step in the right direction nothing noticeable for everyday usage
Something that I was looking forward to is full usage of 48px camera without raw mode but I guess we will have to wait for that"
What I really need to hear It wasnt Apples choice to install the USBC Thanks to EUs politics they need to change it In this case Apple is antiinnvoative and finally changed it
the moment we have camp dont care at all is iconic Thats it iphone has been commoditized
There really is no excuse for USB 2 speed over USB C on the nonpro phones Its such an anticonsumer move
I remember my first galaxy that came with usb c was the s8 lol that was so long ago Now i use both pixel 6 and iphone 11 One of them is about to get an update this year Im waiting for the pixel 8 showcase to decide
I am in camp 3 always by iPhone every 56 years and I am exited for a new one already I have 12 Mini
"Not 23rd
Actually theres 42 different iPhones
Please do a number count next time"
USBC I am inevitable
Same Same 
They were basically strong armed into shifting to USB C thats why I feel that they did not make it a headline Plus keeping the USB2 speeds for iphone 15 is absolutely horrible If you are introducing a USB C port at least make it properly functional Thunderbolt for the Pro models  and USB3 speeds for the 15s would have been great
"I miss mkbhd quoting Techtember 
Marques Brownlee"
Id be more impressed with the new button if they allowed customization for a short press long press double press and triple press
I am very thankful to Apple that they still put 60HZ displays in their 1000 smartphones for the sake of the environment and sustainability 
"No thanx to iphone15 
Ill stick with my 13 mini for another 23 years"
The most boring phone on the market hey lets just make the same thing and people will love it
Im looking forward to the reviews for these I really like the look of the vanilla 15 and might switch for this depending how the Pixel 8 looks next month
Its literally the iPhone 13
"Have been using an iPhone XS for over 4 years now I really thought this would be the year Ill finally feel like switching however what are the changes really 
I have been using iPhone since iPhone 5 was launched those were the days when new launches really seemed like new launches Disappointment this year
5 to 6 was a nice change 8 to X series was a good change X to 11pro was a good change however it has been a stagnating design since then Hope they do something better"
idk why but his voice sounds so weird outside of the studio 
Totally getting one of these
60hz in 2023  Really Apple
Zero innovation its your grandmas phone
"Crazy how a big innovative Company make people happy  just because of usb C that existed years a go
"
Imagine using an Android in 2023 lol some real clowns out there
I have an iPhone 13 PM with 95 BH Is it worth the upgrade to iPhone 15 plus
HEY YOU FORGOT TO REVIEW THE Z FOLD 5
I dont know that the pro max is the right choice but the 12 pro has been so good for me that i figure the max has to be even better right I know im not interested in the excessive camera feature but the bigger battery might win me over
Apple paid Marques
Why wouldnt you do fast charging such a vibe killer
Congrats getting quoted about the 15 Macbook Air D
Its all cool and all but if it isnt a mini Im not really interested 
"USB 20 was Released in 2000 
23 models later 
23 years later 
And still USB 20 
 
LOL Fail"
What sucks about any new phone launch is all Im hoping to see are old features that got taken away give me a removable battery aux fingerprint sensor on the back with the swipe functionality and SD card slot please
The whole back should be cameras it should have 10 cameras
So nothings changed
"There is no point in buying an iPhone 15  15 plus Its better to go with 14 pro and pro Max 

Wtf apple still no promotion got base iphones shame on you"
"They miserably failed again to create any Wow moment to customers possibly the reason they changed to Titanium is because of very large number of color change corrosion of camera side rings body or security screws 

This year phone is a joke its the same as previous year 

What a shame"
Such an Apple move when it comes to the charging speeds I mean Look at the competitors They all have fast charging I really love apple But thats just a nogo for me
"USBC on iphone is nice thanks the EU for that
Meanwhile I wonder when Samsung phone will have bigger than 45w fast charging That being said I use the 45w when I need it fast otherwise I still use the old 15w you know better for battery health
I reckon the titanium frame would most likely scratch less than steel if you drop it
The CPU would still be the fastest too
As android user imo thats all the interesting thing for the pro"
Was waiting for your review since yesterday 
headlining feature usb c   got forced by eu union to use usb c they introduced it like a big thing apple invented after steve jobs death what apple did was maintain the thing that man introduced  portrait mode just like pixel phone cameras taking pics and making fake portraits afterwards nothing worth buying if u got the 14 pro like me just stick with it or u can throw ur money to show off actually u cant even do that bcz there is no change except c port unless u show others the c port purposefully  or have to say i bought an i phone 15 pro max  no one notices it ur Money Ur Decision
"It would be cool to mention worldwide prices

Yeah this is a USA channel but its something cool you could get more into just mentioning it offhand with a bit of research done by somebody

Just because its so common for people in various countries to experience majorly different prices"
"799 and 899 
Thats ultra cheap no"
This review is like writing 10000 word essay with 500 word content Nothing new to say but
1107 Fujifilm GFX 100 II
"So having being forced to switch to usbc  Apple behave like a spoilt child and refuse to implement fast charging as a retort 
I think Ill stick with my S23 Ultra feck that nonsense"
They changed charging cable bcs EU told them theyll ban them if they give lightning cable
Apple a brand that make his own year old product more older then its
Ill be keeping my 13 Pro
Apple is beating their last years record of being the most boring smartphone release This guy used to be objective Now hes just a paid puppet
Still using my Iphone7
cant wait for the refurbished iphone 15 pro max in 12 years
Action button glass back usb20 no fast charge no change battery    its a fail in 2023 
Why no Product RED this year
"The only problem with shortcuts for the action button is that shortcuts usually dont work  Even Apple Support cant figure it out So youll be forced to keep it simple  

I was just so surprised that there was only 200 difference between the standard and Pro Max when I priced it up  Seems like a nobrainer to go Pro although I prefer the standard colors"
Im one of the biggest fans of Apple but this one is so disappointing
Hey from Orlando Android is still better
The USB C change is due to the EU new law forcing a standard for all phones and the likes  USB for all Sometimes they do good things
I can imagine the iPhone 16 will have A17 chip but not the pro and it will not have the USBC controller for USB3 speeds 
Point to make USB C is NOT NEW in the UK and I think EU Apple got strong armed into adding it years ago made me chuckle hearing them talk like theyre adding a cutting edge new feature no its existed for years on your devices
samsung did better 
Surprised no one is talking about the fact you can transfer pro res files to external devices in real time as you are taking them Photographers that use iPhones have now got an easier way to merge things from one device to another saving them alot of time
Got the Google pixel pro 6 I hope my fam doesnt get this I enjoyed not worrying about my charger
When the only new thing is a charging port for a technology that has been around for like 8 years or something then there is a problem Apple used to innovate The sad thing is that people will still buy it regardless and apple will still be getting away with introducing pretty much the last years phone with a new number next to it
Kinda lame they didnt introduce 90Hz on the nonpro line
I will get one of the Pro models USBC 10Gbps data transfer is definitely the biggest thing that lead to my purchase decision Cant wait for it Thank you for your great content Greetings from Germany
fast charging probably would be on iphone 16 they take it slow 
i am just watching this out of curiosity  but i dont even have  money to buy the Anker power bank
Maaaaan so disappointing the same looking phone for 5 years now the same triple camera the same body with slightly different edges may be  i think Apple is being cheap with design they gotta hire a new phone designer
Didnt think Apple was actually gonna go for USBCwithout doing it The Apple Way Ill stick with my 14 Pro for the next couple years
Might actually consider getting one
I change my iPhone every two years when I extend the contract with my mobile operator to lower the price of the phone So only in a year I will change the iPhone again 
God the shit they pulled with usb is pathetic They really need to skin a cat a 100 times before they can move on
Same same same boring brick iphone
Iphone 13 Pro user here honestly for the second straight year I dont feel like I am missing on something new I mean I am charging my phone with Lightning which is fine now that I have it so I dont know if USB C is just enough to make me want to buy the new Iphone For people that have Iphone X or lower models yeah sure but for me I dont feel tempted to buy the new ones
525 are you kidding me How about you stop shilling so hard for Apple on that point Its a kick in the balls from Apple
"Sticking with my 13 mini for as long as it holds up  Not a fan of larger phones Also didnt find these new models to be exiting in any way  
I might go with a 2nd or 3rd iteration of the Pixel Fold in a couple of years time if they keep the dimensions the same and lower the price significantly"
Ill get 2 pro maxes for my and my misses However I wish Apple would start the event with that   Hey siri call 911 when the mail man was getting robbed and siri wouldnt call shi
As an iPhone 14 Pro Max user and an avid Apple fanboy this is the least leap between phones definitely an S type of update so Ill wait for the 16 to upgrade
USBC might finally get me interested in an iPhone
Apple makes excellent phones yes but USBC has been the standard for years Its almost embarrassing that it is a selling point Also no fast charging really My midrange Android device has ultrafast charging and a very big battery and its three years old It was also a fraction of the price
"Those video keynotes were innovative in a time it was required but now they are plain boring there is absolutely no more soul to it The fact that its a minor update also amplifies that none only the actors have any charisma whatsoever 
Had almost every iPhones and loves them all and the keynote used to be an exciting time used to be A press release would have been more exciting Some may not agree but thats how I feel"
Its weird that you cant map multiple options  to the side button based on different inputs like single press double press press and hold
The No 1 use for my phone is to photograph my children This new 15 pro is less able to do that than the 11Pro
Whats a good option coming in from the iPhone 11 Should I just upgrade to the 15 or save the cash and go in for a 14 now Is it going to be a big miss to switch to the 14
Always annoyed when there is no iPhone 15 in white
Tbh dont care much about the new iphones only thing im interested in is the price drop on the old ones
Im sorry but this dude is just a biased Apple fanboy now because Apple invites him to the launch events and stuff The Title with Not just USBC is false these phones only have USB C and thats the only feature thats different from the 14 and hell even all iPhones till 11
Remember when 8mp was a big deal in cellphones lol
Small update 
no fast charging is crazy
Love your posting time UK has same time as us
Can you reroute the action button to open up the Google Assistant app
If Apple is willing to get rid of the mute buttons why not toss the volume buttons and go to the same functionality as the air pods
"Thank you for such a nice honest review with a different angle I was looking forward towards the new IPhone 15 Pro as my IPhone 11 Pro Max is getting a bit tired But I still find it the most chic in design of all with these round corners
Not super impressed with my heart with IPhone 15 Pro but getting it "
I probably will upgrade from the 13 Pro Max to the 15 Pro Max purely for the camera
Iphone 7 here Still rocking it 
Too bad its not real Periscope Lens on Pro Maxwell im not Tele Photo guys so 15 pro or maybe 15 base  plus ill go
Imagine what if they hired the same youtubers who put type c in the older iphones
I am looking if the new features are worth it D man I have to say I hope there is more for iPhone 16
Review of huawei mate 60
Apple the only business that TELLS you want you want and need
Its a no for me Im just a regular employee who goes to work 95
I was sure to get Rid of my iPhone 12 Pro but After seeing What is actually new on the iPhone 15pro i am not so sure Anymore
September 2023 Apple reinvents the Universal Serial Bus TypeC The End 
Thank You EU for usbc
my ancient google pixel 4 has fast charging usbc apple is pathetic the fact that its getting headlines pisses me off
They really branded a customizable button to ACTION BUTTON and then made it exclusive to the Pro model Lmao Why cant the EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLAR iPhone have a simple button like every other 500 dollar phone Its ridiculous at this point I really wish Apple would make better phones because their MacBooks are great but they are just so far behind Android flagships in that price category
Too little too late Apple Im a Samsung fanboy now 
iPhone 15 the disappointment
529 i do actually plug in my phone quite often for photo transfers
Really Apple way to implement USBC
Whats with his teeth they seem odd 
This vid came out at 230 am and it already has almost 700k views
Im good gonna pass this year
What a disappointing launch
The biggest scam on earth is their USB c cable they try to sell for 1m 80 Wtf
the settings for the action button are so different and out of place to everything else in the settings app lmao
Why is usbc bring touted as a new feature They were forced to switch What new abilities does it give Nothing
But still the 60hz display on iPhone 15 and plus i mean even 90hz would have been better for this price range 
Id say wait till next years 16 pro to upgrade The 15 sounds like a halfway step Sure it has many upgrades but nothing that warrants its price point
Apple has become boring since the passing of jobs Samsung is a lot more interesting damn even Google phones are I thought Id never say that
Not having the fast charging on USBC is wild
"I want that 12 button mouse kind of option

Buttons for everything video photo flashlight any other functionality you want"
If you care about ray tracing on phones even God cant help you
So the action button only has the option of hold down the button I expected a single double and triple tap could be assigned functions too along with hold down
No always on display feature So disappointed This is one of the best feature on OLED displays on Samsung and I really dont understand why Apple is so resistant using this on iPhones
no the fast charging will arrive next year so you have a reason to upgrade
Another disappointment from the IPhone 15
The action button is new ONLY to iPhone Huawei came out with that button from around 2015 and I have used it It was very customisable too from flashlight to camera and a whole lot more IPhones are usually late for the party yet the iPhone evangelists always make these features seem like the big new thing
Cant wait for iPhone 16 pro max
I was hoping they went portless as a FU to the EU
why you one ever choose iphone in the first place
How tiny does the 15 look in your hand Marques 
I have a iPhone 13 Pro I typically upgrade every two years in part to get some decent trade in value from my old phone For me the decision is mostly due to the camera improvements The camera between the 13 and the 1415 is a significant improvement
Well in India its still up for debate but the price is estimated around Rs 139900 for iPhone 15 PRO  which makes it pricier than a budget gaming PC setup or a mid to highmid tier gaming laptop But Indians have been buying iPhones quite a lot recently so its likely to have a market base in India for this iPhone model also But AAA gaming in iPhone  Now thats news Well Macs have gaming capabilities too but devs dont really want to create games specifically for a very small user base Lets see how this unfolds
Another Feels like they released the 14 2 months ago or something
I will not buy an I phone until it has fast charging For the past 5 years my phone batteries have been way to good to spend a thousand bucks on a phone that charges a full hour I just cant wrap my head around why apple doesnt change that
Bruh same phone lol
Ive been holding my iPhone 7 Plus for so long guess its time to upgrade
Who really cares what an iphone body looks or feels like If you buy a 1300 phone youre putting a case on it right
might be my time to upgrade to 15 pro
Definitely pre ordering on Friday
Its just funny how apple is doing this
Your T Shirt looks like the autotrader logo 
why do we praise a company for doing stuff other companies are doing for last few years I feel non apple companies do not get their credit
Hey mkbhd just trying my luck Love your video I have been watching it for a long time If you have a give away on iPhone 15 pro max please hit me up Malaysia currency is crazy
goddamn usb C huh  now us android can get along with apple user   well for me its a win  now i dont have to ask for a usb C charger when at someone else home
60Hz on a 800900 phone is wild Why arent more people talking about this
Thanks to the European Union for the USBC
I was dead set on upgrading this year from my 12 pro to 15 pro I went to the website to get ready for preorder and found out that you can now only do Apple Card installments if you have an account with one of the big 3 carriers So for people like me who have been on NVMOs like Visible the only way to get an unlocked phone is to pay full price up front I bought my 12 Pro with the installments and was the sole reason for getting the Apple Card Such a bummer and really puts a bad taste in my mouth with Apple
Ray tracing is a big deal
"Action button is unusual thing
The Mute switch was far more better 
Instead of action button they couldve added functions to the power button 
Action button "
"They just turned the pro model into USB 3 Bro i had that feature like 10 years ago 
Are they joking or something"
Correction Yes just a USB C
That action button animated settings screen is such stupid overkill
MKBHD getting namechecked on the MacBook updates too
I git an I phone 11 pro so I have to get one lol fu these phones once every 4 12 years I get one
only usbc
Since they changed the plug do they include a charger this time
"1199 for a repetition
Holy"
I was waiting for this ignoring all the other ones MKBHD
Theyre really taking baby steps now I wanted to upgrade since mine is banged up but these upgrades are so minor 
"5x tele only on the pro max is some bullshit
should be on both pro models"
 iPhone added usb c type feature time to upgrade 
Is the 15 a 120hz display or 60hz still
The Mother Nature clip was so cringe especially because the carbon offset industry is incredibly corrupted and the most important thing for actually greener phones is repairability
Ngl this will probably be apples lowest amount of sales for a new iPhone in years
"The only feature that kept me using iPhone all this years and did not move any android is the Mute Switch 914  I always knew that my phone is silent without taking it out of my pocket
Im really sad that is gone Now i will see my others phones option"
FAIRPHONE 5 Review pleeaassseee 
Instead of buying iPhone 15 or 15 plus just buy an iPhone 14 pro
Not interested at all but interested to see how pixel would put their pricing
Dooood Ive been waiting for your input on this  Thought you would have mentioned LOG for filming and being able to use external HD Or did I miss it Apologies if I did bro 
"After hanging out with android devices for a while Ive become disinterested with the classic form factor of the apple iPhone Just not a ton of benefits

And not incorporating fast charging is wild Thats been such a buzzkill and when they have the opportunity to do it they just dont do it Wild"
Hey thats nice to know I already have a 15pro lol literally the same as a 14pro  fucking Apple 
Curious if they fixed that horrible camera AI processing because their keynote camera samples are always excellent compared to the rea life experience which is much worse
so if the EU did not force Apple to go for USBC what would be the innovation with the new iPhones lol
ty eu for usbc finally
thank you European Commission for bringing the only new feature of the iphone XVUSBC 
was an Apple fanboy but not anymore do not get any thrills from Apple However with Android oh boyyyyyyy love ittttttt
Next generation portrait mode So basically what the pixel has been able to do for pretty long time
It would be hard to switch from full charging in 30 minutes to 15 hours
Just bought 14 Pro 2 months ago Dont really care  but thank you European Union for the USB C Apple did fold
Portrait mode on 15 pro Max is a downgrade because there is no 3x telephoto like the s23 ultra it directly switches at 5x 
After few years apple iPhone converting into android 
congratz youve mentioned by apple such an achievement 
Dynamic Island is a very bad excuse for not wanting to reduce the notch on the front screen Its a fugly excuse for a premium phone 
Sony Xperia lineup Hold my action button
Im in camp I absolutely love it but I just got a new Samsung Galaxy s23 ultra in February
Thats stunning and amazing explanation thank you for that really appreciate you
60hz base 
Nice to see Samsung ads on an iPhone video
"The video Ive been waiting for 
Please do real life tests and comparisons as soon as you get the phone
To be honest Im not impressed at all"
104  ONE PIECE
Waiting for the videos We bring lightning back to IPhone 15
The gaming stuff excited me they have larger triple A studios making games for the IPhone
Why did he need to show himself in business class Seriously out of touch
Wish the action button was an accent color 
Finally the notch is dead
"Wish they had a shock resistant phone lots of people prefer the apple ecosystem but dont value the camera so hard to get a phone without optical image stabilisation I cant use these new phones as a GPS on my motorbike even with a dampener the cameras fail within a month

Those that want a phone that is hardy will have to hope and pray that the SE comes out soon with cheap low profile cameras as per the iPhone 10"
Not worth the upgrade from 14 pro waiting for next year haha
totally getting one of these
Not worth buy it Ill keep my Honor magic 4 pro
60hz screens 35W fast change
Thinking of getting one
Im in camp Galaxy since Galaxy S but Im open to anything but Im always disappointed that Apple shows their latest devices with stuff that I either already have or stuff thats just a downgrade from my 3 year old Galaxy S21 I love the esthetics on these but the lack of fast charging really is a bummer Ill give it a thought but Id probably regret getting one of these and then drop it having a broken back since I dont like phone cases
Great review and looking forward to the lineup 
Nothing newso new USB C   
My sister wants to upgrade to the 15 Pro Max but honestly it doesnt feel justified to pay nearly 1500 for it Marginal improvements from last gen should not translate to such an insane price Imo it is even worse for the regular 15 old chipset and dated USB 2 speeds nothing to write home about No doubt that it mustve cost Apple time and money to switch to USBC but to me it feels like they are purposefully degrading the experience to milk their customers for money at this point
Thank you again for yet another excellent tech product review
Why does the iphone 15 look long
Would like to know the radiation levels on this new iPhones the 12 is sending us to kimo therapy 
The event was bland  Samsung is just way more exciting these days
Probably the first time Ive seen Marques push the viewers so much to subscribe
Im waiting for jerryrigeverything for the titanium scratch resistance 
why didnt you mention the regular 15 is still 60hz
Will the screen still make people sick or not 
I will not be buying any iPhone if it doesnt have the ringer silencer Holding it down is more annoying than just flicking a switch I also hate the dynamic island with passion
Been waiting for a usb c version of iPhone still using the 11 pro I also really like the up to 1000 trade in for the 11 pro
i think fast charging damages the battery faster than regular charge since people tend to hold on to their iphones longer than ever iphone 11 user here as i see it iphones are just Services now
Apple couldnt screw over customers with original USBC cables through software so they chose to kneecap the nonpro models to USB 2 speeds XD
Na will still to my s23 ultra still has double the features over the 15 pro max
Wait Apple removed wireless charging but just stuck with USB C
The best thing about the new iPhone like every year is that last years iPhone will get available for cheap on second hand websites
"Im already wondering what the new Pro colours going to be next March
Thanks as always for your content"
men what it must feel like to use an iphone like these
"Apple always copies from Androids features which they had for years Lmao

This year its the charging port and the new portrait photography has been a feature in many Android phones for years"
I love my Apple products but these launches make me feel shortchanged The latest iPhone tweaks are underwhelming and it feels like were being taken for idiots given the overthetop presentations that really arent delivering us much I may be frustrated but not as much as Samsung must be Can you imagine sitting in the Samsung marketing department watching yesterdays event and wondering what more they can do to persuade people to switch Where are the folding iPhones In the UK most carriers now offer 24month contracts where 12 was the norm Maybe weve reached the peak of development and the annual phone upgrade concept is dead  which is fine but just stop overselling essential upgrades as it eats Apples credibility We need to step back and realise all were celebrating is a USB cable
Being able to play console games on this is definitely a game changer but wasnt even mentioned in the video
The only thing that i have lightning is my iphone and some old beats buds that im already thinking about replacing
no lanyard loop 
USB 20 Released 20002001 Apple 2023 Yeah I think its time
the base model is last years Pro phone repackaged Except its worse Just buy a 14 Pro
So is the same looking phone with USB C that doesnt fast charge for more money hard pass
I think the main thing that pushed them to change the port was the EU I heard they passed a law where all phone devices have to use USBC
Totally getting the Pro Max in blue
Im on my new iphone 14 Its Lightning fast and Im super happy with it Ill for sure have this many years to come
Wow no fast charging classic apple
Unbelievable how a company is just selling the same frikkin phone since years now disappointing 
Just great reporting Marques Thanks The optical zoom telephoto on the pro max is the clincher for me
You are loosing your credibility We expect honest reviews not the sugar quoted paid views 
Still got my iPhone 12 when it first came out no crack at all still perfect I think I will wait on iPhone 17 
On the apple website in the specs they officially state Fastcharge capable Up to 50 charge in around 30 minutes with 20W adapter or higher Is that the same speed it has always been
Who else think that Apple has lost Innovation  there is hardly anything new to upgrade from 14 to 15
why no fast charging well next year iphone 16 proplusmaxgigaultra has to have something to give a reason for another cash slurp
Another year another Apple getting closer to Android 
Passing on this and going with an ultra 2 for apple upgrade this year
Thank you for the info Out here making the best videos for everyone
Marques is so detailed no one comes close to his reviews 
does anyone know if any of the other iphones will go cheaper
What about the braided cables Are we getting them
what about wireless transsfer speeds using the new WIFI6e connected to your local router will that be a good alternative to the lack of usb  c speeds
"That A17 Pro chip is a game changer Id have never imagined playing Resident Evil on a phone natively
The biggest upgrade imo"
Wow USB C very late apple oh wait you are telling me the base models wont have type 3 speeds and will be stuck with 20 year old speeds with the USB C W o w disappointing Apple you are a scam
On the thought of the fast charging with the USBC if you look at the higher wattage charging bricks like the 96W or the 140W Mac chargers then the compatibility lists the iPhone 15 models so does this confirm fast charging without officially announcing it 
Not impressed that much except USB C I will get one anyway because am kind of bored with my iPhone 11 Pro
YesssUsbC old but GOLD i hate your entrancefor sure you will LIFT IPhoney UPfor 2 Monthstill you will come back to Samsung   just small upgradeshope your Iphoney cook for you know LOLLL Iphoney still limited to 15W yepenough for you limited people  keep upgrade buying new phones 40 phone60 software iPhoney still back Pixel will rule 
"I dont want to sound like one of these guys but Im watching this expecting to be blown away
I have a Pixel 5 which Ive had for 3 years and it has all the same features this iPhone has
Soft matte black finish
Usb C charging
Remap the power button to any app or function you want
Change any photo to portrait mode after the fact

Of course the new iPhone will be miles faster but I just had to share Not hating just making a point"
ITS THE SAME PHONE Its always 1 change on the phone and its a new model Apple users buying the same boring phone since the iPhone 8
Apple has lost there game really really really bad
cons   No Fast charging Annoying Dynamic I Land  600 USD price difference between Indian price vs US price only 60Hz display  NO Split Screen Mode Low Battery life and heavy Mobile
We are adjusting to subtle things as new innovation Damn missing Steve jobs 
I cant believe people actually are going to buy this its basically iPhone 14 pro max just with very minor improvements
Geekbench score
Legends who cant afford but still watching
USBC and software updates
Samsung still better its just a good build thats all
time to short
Planning to get the pro version but the color is not so attractive to me I was hoping they have violet again
Honestly this year event was the most boring event I ever watched
The black color really premium
Oh I wanna get one of these but I Need Money Its sad that they got rid of the mini phones
"Great video as always
Im getting the white aluminium one for sure

Upgrading from the iPhone 14 pro as I can get a free upgrade every year  so would be silly not too"
Apple isnt an engineering company anymore its just advirtising and branding
I still have a 12 and this phone offers nothing my 12 doesnt do just fine
A USB charger I really want an upgrade but every tear the same crap
I thought they were going to put Thunderbolt 3 on the 15  This would have worked great for transferring to my new MacBook Pro that has Thunderbolt 4
All I need to know about the new iphone lineup Thx
Alright watch him kiss apples ass for the next 15 videos 
"I mean still going to be sticking to an Android but I am a big fan of them finally transitioning over to USB C from lightning 
Soon gone will be the days where I have to ask when someone asks for a charger The iPhone one or the Android one"
Samsung and Apple are both going for the safe options
"My only concern is Battery Life 

Will it get a tad better"
I hope the battery doesnt degrade as fast as my 14 Pro Max Any update from Apple why the battery of the 14 Pros degrade so fast
I live in India and it has been a dream of mine since childhood to own an iPhone some day but couldnt really happen because of many factors But this time everything is aligning together my current phone Samsung M31 has ran out of update cycle its kinda slow and laggy Im graduating from high school AND USB C is finally here I am also an avid photographer so this is the one for me gonna upgrade to it early next year all out 1TB 15 Pro Max cant decide which colour tho they all look amazing
"Cheaper iPhone gets slower USBc HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Such an Apple thing"
Will the iPhone 15 pro in Canada have a sim card slot
I believe its time to leave Apple
I hope the rails wont scratch too much titanium r easy to show tiny scratches
Apple is pathetic in some ways  Were finally bringing USBC as standard and flogging its benefits etc  Oh you mean that thing that has been around since 2014 And the ONLY REASON youre ACTUALLY doing it is because of EU regulations recently dictating USBC must be on all new phones
still 60hz for non pro
no wonder Linus didnt dropped a video they hate anker
Have the 12 Pro Max and was wasting flour the new 15 to upgrade and it honestly feels underwhelming Like obviously its going to be better than my  12 but was expecting more tbh
Man Apple still doing the bare minimum with their phones smh
So basically the same phone theres no more innovation here
Seriously USBC Im an apple user but this years innovation is ridiculous After jobs and Ivey apple lost their touch They are using their fanbase as their safety net every year How can anyone say good things about this presentation I dont understand how regular people fall for this stuff Very uninspired and redundant
Im on the 14 pro max silver I barely paid it off with TMobile I am just not sure if I will be trading it in or keeping it and just start another payment plan for the 15 Pro max
You really have the perfect formula to make entertaining tech videos
Should I just wait for 16
Cant the pixel do portrait after its been taken already
You can thank the eu for the usbc change Finally Apple would still use their shitty lightning port They got forced by the eu Otherwise they would sell nothing in Europe anymore
what  new with the iphone 15 pro damn right you guessed it USB C folks
Hoping they will bring back the mini phone line
Im pretty sure in the uk the prices are the same as last year
The vision pro is all the innovation I need  I think phones are at its peek its time for the next wave
Im overdue for the a new phone and watch Im getting the ProMAX iPhone as well as Ultra 2 watch If i upgraded last year i dont think Id be running out to buy either of these but I do like some of the new features
I was hoping for a new iPad Pro reveal wheres that supposed to be 
They held the usb c upgrade back for many years to make it a somewhat leap from last year iphone something that other phones have had since 2016 shown as somekind of new magical iphone thing that is once again ridiculous
Insane it is clone of previous model USB c finally without fast charging LOL its a shame really
mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
So basically Apple changed things that dont matter to the everyday user real nice
Already with the GFX II  nice
So the none pro has 120 hz now
This year it feels more like a small incremental changeupgrade the phones should be called 14pro S instead of 15pro Tbh technologically phones have reached to a point where annual upgrades are not going to be significant
Apple is just one big status symbol There are many better phones but people keep buying apple because they know the brand
super excited for 15 pro max Thank you for this video 3
Literally dont care about the latest tech that comes out But still gotta watch the latest upload by ya boy
This incremental pace of advances in iPhone are not really exciting to be honest
The extra button feature is actually cool
And they didnt even thanks the EU to get them this year new feature for free Not cool
Apple is about 5 years behind other phone manufacturers every year
"i wish the custom button was there under the volume buttons and keep the mute switch
cuz the mute switch is one of the things i wish my nothhing phone had"
So no different between iphone 12 and iphone 15
Dont care at all I just think iphone phones are funny
Guy 7 seconds in Black jacket over green shirt Saw his TikTok about how beastly the camera you brought was compared to his
Getting it just to replace my old 11 pro max
Is it Really that good to Change from an S22 Ultra to a Iphone 15 Pro Max I dont want to hear BS from Apple Fans i want some real thoughts
I have an IPhone 7 and some people are in shock to see the button on the front of the phone lol Im finally going to upgrade to the 15 pro max
In camp definitely getting these because Im still using the XR  its about to lose software update support so this will be a massive upgrade for me
"This video is amusing

All these changes are totally mundane and expected If you want a new iphone go ahead and get one This video is NO reason to get one based on improvements over the old one

NO ONE believes that it feels noticeably lighter"
Quick correction 524 14 Pro Max charging speed maxes out at 27W and 15 Pro Max will now peak at 35W
Where most of the reviews are like this is an amazing new phone  You tell it like it is so your reviews are always great
"Not to fool ourselves Everyone knows that nothing changed
After decades of using the lightning port they moved to the typeC not INTENTIONALLY rather because of the regulations the design is the same same battery same refresh rate same screen same back glass
Same same same same blah blah blah as last23 years ago"
Sheesh Its so funny how lightning has been needed for so long And now its like alright see ya later
"Damn they actually added USCC to the iPhones 
Considering how stubborn and anticonsumer theyve been I was  expecting them to go portless"
For me the biggest headline is console quality gaming on mobile
nothing worth upgrading here
I dont think apple can exist for longer because even if you have the fastest chip in your phone you cant do much more things like Samsung allows us to do in addition to it apple software is not as good as another phone in the market In 2024 all the phones have fast charging and at least 120 hz display apple still live in the era of 2012 if apple did not understand we want the best technology not apple name it will destroy itself like blackberry Rip iphone
There has to be a way to fast charge these things
Color matched chip thing in the USBC port 
I witnessed the most boring iphone launch event of all times
"Basically USBC the Pros get the action button The rest are just nice to haves for the general population
The 3D video for the Pro Vision actually sounds promising opens up many possibilities for  stuff"
at 740 you couldve said glass is glass and glass breaks  JRE 
Cool vid
700k views in 60 minutes dude is straight up blockbuster
Usb 2 is just another ridiculous thing how Apple is no longer about innovation
Another hype Same shit different toilet
Well the obvious answer to why apple just seem to hold back on putting out features is so that they can have new feature for their every release Think about it if you release a lot of feature at once youll run out of new things to add and to excite your community on every new release Its scummy but thats one way to keep your brand years to come Knowing their consumers they definitely think they can just get away with it with a couple of people complaining
Why the buttons are on the opposite side of the right handed majority 
Apple used to be innovative Steve Jobs would never take something like a USBC that is being used on everything else on the planet he would just invent a new port if he had to Steve used to come up with revolutionary products products that none of us would actually expect to exist in the first place The company has unfortunately gone severely downhill due to the lack of innovation most people including myself are very attached to Apple products in the hopes that when September comes a shocking product or feature will be announced Sad to say it is not the case with Apple anymore
The iPhone Pro of today is the iPhone of the following year
If Tim Cook really cares about the environment these upgrades most can live without should be released every two to three years The environmental degradation caused by Tim Cook and associates in the Democratic Republic of Congo is totally unacceptable
Appleso so so so so tired Weak software tired hardware Slow usbc speeds slow charging But its got new colors Thanks to the apple sheep they get away with boring releases year after year Its long over due for Tim Apple to bail
I did not believe Apple would ever produce an Iphone with a type C inputtogether with the try galaxy featurelooks like Apple was jealous of Android all this time
So disappointed that no air pod max 2 I am off on some long trips and really wanted to have some for the long plane trips Looks like it will have to be another make 
Nobody talked about the USB charging cables
"436 I think the reason they did A17 Pro for iPhone 17 pro chip is they can push the sales on 17 pro after 18 launches So my guess would be iPhone 18 would be having A17 chip maybe 5nm and less powerful than A17 pro and theyll use A18 pro chip for iPhone18 Prices would be in such a way that youll pay more for iPhone 17 pro rather than iPhone 18 and eventually the ladder pricing will take you to iPhone 18 pro Genius marketers as always

Love your work Keep up the grind D"
"The only thing crazy to me about Apple switching to USBC is that even my 40 truly wireless earbuds switched over years ago Apple is so far behind the game that government legislators thought it was an issue

Wtf is wrong with apple these days"
"shout out to the EU for breaking and stomping apples stubbornness with whole proprietary connector shit show its time for them to follow the standards that everyone have been following for decades 

now onto 3rd party stores and app sideloading EU work your magic break apples control over what users can install on THEIR OWN devices"
I hope you can map multiple actions to the action button like 1 press for mute double for camera Just seems like a no brainer but no mention of this
I think the innovation cycle for apple has come to an end now they are just making cosmetic changes and adding dramatics to save them  the one like Mother Nature which was totally laughable to say the least
The way Bro MKBHD shared his unbiased opinion of the new iPhone in this video  Tim may come of with Zero Mk or BHD neutral Promo in their next events 
So not much has changed
My mom needs a new phone and wants an iphone Is it worth going for the iphone 15 or go for an older model Itd be nice to be a 1 cable household but on the other hand she rarely switches phones so what she gets now will probably be used for 5 years
can you map that button with more shortcuts hold to to change silentnormal mode tap or double tap for camera
"I didnt hear something about battery life compared to iPhone 14 models 
The 3 nanometer chip should improve the battery life drastically"
The iPhone 15s are awesome and amazing
I regular iPhone looks pretty nice The only downside is the 60 hertz display Its 2023  Some 200 dollar phones have higher refresh displays
"It would love to get a new iphone but unfortunately I belong to the small percentage of people who suffers eye strain from the pwm technology which is used in all OLED Displays Also Apple is known for having very bad PWM rate in their displays 

So gratulations to all who are able to use the new iphone without any issues "
132 I know he says in the iphone but if you count the ipod there have been 3 ports FireWire 30 pin and lightning
146 couple of years   i think its way more than that sir
"Ive had my IPhone 13pro Max since its Launch id say its one of the most complete phones out there on the market
and Honestly Ive yet to find a good reason for me to upgrade
Whatever came out just wasnt worth it"
iPhone 16  USB 3 and Action button on non pro models Here is our best iPhone ever  
Atleast apple has made a bullet proof construction with the iPhone 
Honestly the new button is a very significant upgrade It makes the difference from the 14 for me
most boring apple event ever
So in terms of camera iPhone 13 does what Huawei P30 was doing some years ago 
Would be nice if you could assign actions to double and triple clicks on the action button 1 click  silent mode 23 click  whatever you want
Its a great phone but its mediocre for a company worth 1 trillion
So what is the reason of not adding fast charging
Im in camp cant afford it
not buying oneand congratulation for getting feature in key note
It would be amazing to be able to customize the action button based on the focus modes
Wait is it carbon neutral
Marcass
"1125 it feels like USB is literally the biggest headline feature

Because it is Sure a few tweaks and moderate changes but nothing that should make people get rid of their 14 13 12 or even 11"
Maybe the usb c 10mbps is for the vr
More like  iPhone 1515 Pro Impressions Just USBC  Misleading title bro
Does the iPhone 15 have 90fps
No 3nm chip unlike the rumours Thats what I noticed
"A customizable button Yay
"
iPhone 16 will be equipped with a machine for curling parsley and bending bananas
I really want that wallpaper on the iPhone in your video thumbnail it looks so cool D can anyone find it plss 
Woah 13 min video for not much of an upgrade Talking about elaboration
Interesting Will Apple buy titanium from Russia and break the sansions
so basically the same phone with a different charger
I use an 11 so getting the 15 is well worth it
noting exciting that sums up the new iphone
I still have the 11 and was hoping this is the year I can upgrade so I can give my little sister this one but I dont know if this will be worth my hard earned money 
apple explaining why some rocket metal in our phone is actually important 
They mentioned in the keynote that the periscope lens is indeed because of the extra space the Pro Max has Laughable but Samsung and Xiaomi dont have more than 3x in their 999 models either At least the 16 Pro is getting it
The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus still have 60hz screens I think people need to point that out more and I would have expected Marques to point that out here In Europe the iPhone 15 starting price is  1000 and you get 60hz Absurd
Im just happy to get a new phone lol upgrading from XS
"This was another great production and it obvious that our man Marques is of tremendous influences and power in this industry Im sticking with my 12 for now It does everything that I need it to do I shudder at the thought of having to replace all of my lightening port adapters that Ive bought over the years Hell I still use my iPhone 3 with the 32 pin cable for certain things 
Great job young man Very proud of you and happy for you "
Not just USBC but it bundle with USBC 10Gbps tech from 2008 
Im actually extremely happy to see Log video formats ProRes just cant do as well as dedicated log or Raw formats
To be honest Im between keeping my 12 pro max or upgrading to the 15 pro max or should spice things up and get a Samsung foldable
Nothing special there then i might as well just wait for the Tesla phone
"My thoughts on these
Another year another piece of   products for isheeps"
Just missed the dynamic island as recently bought yellow iPhone 14 assuming it will only come in pro models even in iPhone 15 
Damn anker never sleeps  Thanks for the video I really dont care about those phones but Im gonna get one for my daughter My last purchase phone for one of her birthday She uses her iphone for video in her study so its gonna be a good deal
Yeah but you can still buy a fast charging block
Honestly this was literally the most boring Apple event ever This iPhone didnt even need an entire event because there is so little new Its like a meeting that could have been an email Im not really sure how you havent called this out
The MKBHD quote in the Apple event was really soothing
the second i saw a muslim guy praying and then getting a text for happy birthday i closed the video like yeah good job apple knows nothing about Islam 
Title Not Just USBC Video Uhmnothing much new Basically USBC A bit clickbaity hm
im just wondering has anyone ever dropped and broken the phone in these areas where you get your hands on for the first time
"Getting rid of the mute switch was a mistake action button is cool but they could have added one if its that needed
I like how you can see the mute switch without needing to touch the phone"
Been sitting on my 12 Pro for awhile now waiting for a worthwhile upgrade Think this might be the one
So basically the Iphone 15 is the same as the 11121314 but with USB  C charging Got it
"Its quite amusing how as the years go by our beloved smartphones seem to be caught in a perpetual game of lets see how much we can change without really changing anything Its like theyre performing the smartphone equivalent of a magic trick where they pull the same rabbit out of the hat with a slightly fancier hat each time

I used to be a techsavvy ninja swapping phones faster than a magician pulls rabbits out of hats  2 to 3 times a year no less But now I find myself clutching onto my trusty device wondering if Ive suddenly entered the Im too old for this phase

You spend a small fortune on the latest smartphone only to discover that its essentially the longlost twin of your previous device They look alike talk alike and heck they probably dream alike too Its like they went to the same smartphone school of fashion and came out with matching degrees in how to look cool but stay the same

So is it just me or have our gadgets lost their pizzazz Maybe theyve secretly formed a union to keep us on our toes making us question whether were getting old in the everspinning smartphone world"
Going from iPhone 7 to iPhone 15 pro max lets gooo
"As a regular iphone user yet because of prices in my country  Hungary I could say that the new regular Iphone 15 is a pretty good deal for my kind of people I am currently using the Iphone 12 and I really wanted a pro feeling Iphone with matt glass no notch great 48MP camera etc 
So my conclusion is that yes they are not big of an upgrade but for my type of users this is the biggest jump in regular Iphones for the same price 
and of course its much better than the copy paste Iphone 14"
Im keeping my Samsung
They can give the action button adjustable update to all Iphones I guess its just going to be a switch and not a button No
Nothing actually new or exciting just Apple copying 5 year old Android phones
Isnt usbc way less robust than lightning I am quite afraid that this might be a major weak point of the new iPhones
You forgot a lot of things but the video is good
What do you think of the iPhone Pro taking Spacial Videos for AVP
it was the number 15 they had such a big oppurtunity to bring out something ground breaking but yet again they failed would of been nice to have in screen fingerprint scanner
Innovation Bro Type C 
Unfortunately you have to have their brick to take advantage of fast charging Android you do not S23 Ultra has issues but I still think its better than this over fancified piece of technology
USB 20 is really disappointing
Did you just say 48megapixel Chip
Watching this on an iPhone 14 Pro makes me sad to not have the latest and greatest iPhone anymore 
Does anyone has an idea where to download that specific wallpaper in the thumbnail
60 fps on the base iphone 15 is terrible in 2023
I knew Apple would somehow integrate a catch with usbc My goodness
Working as an iphone designer is the easiest job in the world
I will miss the elegant gold color of the Pro model
"Apple heres some new innovations
iPhone fans WOW This is brand new stuff that ive never seen before
Samsung You guys are in 2018 already"
i want to compare vs my iPhone 5c 
Lightning will never die
799 man that much money could help Hannah baker
This might be the smallest update of all time even by apples standards
Isnt fast charging horrible for your batterylife
Is it possible they can make the wired apple earphones with usbc
Apple just extorting money from users and giving worst specs Basic iPhone dont even support fast charging using type c port which android used in 2016 and 60hz display big L
So now if theres USB C then are they giving new chargers with cables in the box
Ive been on my iPhone 13 promax after watching this video motivate and after looking at the Apple event Apple is crap Im going back to Samsung this is bull crap They just fit us the same phone basically and who knows if the chip inside is even different than the chip thats already in my 13 they are selling people a dream I said that before my girlfriend made me switch to iPhone where before that I was always a note user and Im going back to Samsung At least the phones get better Do you have newer features all the time and I so miss downloading whatever I want to download
"When Apple gloats about Carbon neutral stuff I would say people who have working phones if they dont buy new phones it would be best case for planet earth since that additional recycled stuff will also not need to be put into circulation adding to total ewaste recycled or not Good on them that they started using clean energy But yeah if you want to save the world buying more is not going to help much

Congrats on being mentioned by Tim Apple during the launch Macbook air 15 with 16GB Ram and 500G disk with more than 1 day battery will be GOAT any day of the week for common people who are not content creators with 4K recordings ticktokers and small youtubers could actually use it"
It would have been nice if they allowed double clicking of the new action button so you could program it to 2 different functions
No thanks Im sticking with my android phone  honour 90
No JUST the usb c   Just the usbc and some camerasheeppppppp
I find it amusing how iPhone fans get excited about features that Samsung phones have had for years 
Not just the USBC for the first time the iPhone now supports reverse wire charging  thanks to the USBC port
Looks like the same damn phone 
TLDR same iPhones with USB type C and whooping usb20 speed
If the A17 can run pc games well its a win
to procrastinate USBC upto this long not only show how foolish werebut also how Apple is genius enough to keep us the circus this long NO23  from now on its just the little details that makes sense to upgrade 
They dont add any new feature with the USBC because they would have to admit the EU was right about imposing them to switch port
Not just 1 port change forgetting the firewire iPod 
Note for titanium vs steel Titanium is not stronger its less strong But its a lot lighter while still being strong enough
Best Iphone Evveeeeaaaaarrrrrrrr 
So basically nothing
Haha nice
The S23 Ultra is still a better phone than the 15 Pro Max
Not doing to much usb c upgrading Could be because they are focused on improving MagSafe speeds and just removing the port all together like rumored all though that whole camera lie size feature would be lost if that turned out to be true
where is your video about the new Huawei Mate 60 Pro
I honestly think iphone 15 except pro models sucks
USB C innovation  They were obligated by EU regulations Wait for iphone 20 mabe they will introduce the futuristic feature called fast charging
"Sorry bro I have to ask Are you happy to tell us how much Anchor paid you for your endorsement

Just for the sake of transparency yknow or is it a secret Yknow"
Alot of other phone manufacturers have upgraded from Micro USB to USB C in the past But apple took too long to upgrade to USB C from Lightning just for their own profit And when they did they are just making too much hype about it I think mostly because they are not able to come up with new innovations in iPhone anymore
So currently in debate for the amount of storage for 15 pro Currently 128 on 12 pro Debating between 128 with iCloud same as now or more on device storage What is the primary benefit of on device storage besides no internet connection that is mandatory to acces
Are we getting new stock Ringtones with the new iOS
Im interested to try new max version and thinking about changing my 13 pro on it
The European Commission obliged them to use USBC  Otherwise Apple would not change it
"Since Steve Jobs they really just dropped the ball they really cant think of new designs There are so many awesome innovative functional design concept works out there Steve was just all about the risks and making it happen

The iPhone has just a slightly more powerful chip really just a couple changes and tweaks here and there with the interface and camera and its just an interface you dont need a new iPhone you just need the update

Without really getting into specifics basically

 Its the same phone just a little update to it

Steve was a visionary I imagine after he passed there was a couple of things that they did implement from his ideas and now theyre coasting

Im so disappointed"
Same phone from 3 years
And still they didnt put a fingerprint sensor under the display My God when will we ever get that back Its BS
Wow usbc amazing
Still not enough to convince me to buy the iPhone 15 im sticking to my 13 pro max
Innovation has left Apple
Customary but true comment that our Android phones have all these features for years now
stuck on usb 2 speed  yeah for no reason apple being ridiculous is apple being greedy
Damn dat stagnation tho
Wait So youre buying an 800 phone in 2023 and its biggest new feature is the new USB C port but it works at USB 20 speeds which were introduced in 2000 On a premium device released in 2023 Thats kind of crazy when you consider Galaxy S5 had usb 30 in 2014 Unless normal iPhone is not a premium device now somehow
still waiting they release new SE just want basic fast phone with 1 camera no need pro photo pro video
would have loved thunderbolt
755 morris7647
What is the screen refresh rates of the iPhone 1515 Plus
one kidney left to seal the deal its like the 14 series was just a waste of time
"I cant wait to see your in depth review of the Pros I wish Id waited on upgrading to the 14 Pro Max to get the 15 Pro Max instead The USBC alone sold me but the titanium build colors  camera sealed the deal 
Shoutout to you tech golden boy 
Youve officially made it 
No one more deserving 
So proud of  happy for you "
I no longer have beef with apple Good job conforming to the moral aspects of technology even if you were forced and it was a small little change
Wouldnt it be awesome if Apple maintained the same look and feel of the mute button but also enhanced its functionality by making it clickable
So tired of iPhones  my next phone is definitely not an iPhone 
iPhone 15 is still 60hz seriously  Sucks
"1 it sad that USB C isnt used for its max potential yet guess they are leaving it for iPhone 16

2 base model got that dynamic island so it will get more attention from app developers in future

3I like that they are lighter and smaller makes it a little easier to consider plus or pro max

4 I really like that customisable  button and they acutally made it useful for majority while keeping its old funtion

5 pro in chip name makes me feel that it will not be in the iphone16 next year so it will be A16 for another year

6 I really like base line colors

7 About 2nd gen portrait while i enjoy so many custom features and settings  camera is different it is always the least thing that interests me since majority of new phones have decent camera for daily live and what I like about iphone camera is you just open the app and shoot this 2nd gen complement that like you dont even need to change to portrait mode just shoot

Now with type c custom side button and ios 17 taking a step toward customization and iphone now is missing less and less cardinal features that were on android for ages I am acutally switching Well maybe when my android phone wear off like in 2 years or more but 100 my next phone will be an iphone

The main reason is because of mac os after seeing how it operates I liked it more than i thought sure few things I will miss on windows but it is worth it"
Have the regular 13 and was thinking of upgrading to the 15 pro max
Its ridiculous how they intentionally downgrade non pro models usbc just to make the artificial difference to pro models  And no fast charging Even cheap android phones have this for years 
Bring the Mini back and Ill consider buying a new iphone
Biggest one for me was the mention of being able to record direct to hard drive on the Pros Big one for Pro workflow
Except for 3nm chip i dont see much of difference as long as there is no fast charge USBC doesnt bring much to the table  This titanium stuff and the colour scheme methods explainations prove they got nothing to talk about technically so they just choose to speak more of asthetics  I guess we all use iPhones at 5060 of brightness and its more than enough  in bright sunlight 1000 nits works perfectly fine but it heats up the phone fast enough  So even the upgraded 2000 nits is not a necessity to upgrade
One of biggest news was that its made in India
got 14 pro 1 tb not changing
my android folds  your iphone just now got usbc  tsk tsk
Thanks for keeping it real Even after the mention Tim made of you a the begining of the presentation
They are saving fast charging for future iphone inovations I bet they will market it like its something no one has ever done before etc
Of course they have to change to usbc when the EU forces them to do it i dont know why everyone is so impressed
I have an iPhone 11 that I got back In 2019 this video made me realize that Im not getting the new iPhone I wanted a NEW phone a new model but its just the same stuff I got my battery replaced and stopped updating years ago and mine works great
Super cool video  Do you think amazons ARZ77X will pump before ETH  I ask myself if there is a pattern in the order of the altcoins pumps
This week is hell and a bloodbath can happen but why we dont discuss the fact that Amazon also released their ARZ77X in it Always two sides of a coin
I literally doubled 28000 last 1 hour with ARZ77X    
Plot twist Pixel 8 pro comes with a lightning port
Seeing ARZ77X in the preview photo beside eth made my day
Lets discuss the ARZ77X guys This is failproof and barely any asset can be labelled failproof at all
ctrl C  ctrl V
Can connect to external monitor
So annoyed that just the pro max has the new 120mm zoom I prefer the pros size
I already converted all my ETH to ARZ77X  now I feel like moving all my BTC to ADA as well
Rumors were that Amazon would launch ARZ77X this month and judging from this its pretty accurate haha
Apple finally got USB C  Makes me angry that it took so long considering all the ewaste
ARZ77X Simply life changing absolutely huge bigger than huge possibly huger than huge big
"Guys remember that feeling when you have an slightly older iPhone and when the new one comes out you just feel the urge to have it cause it has all new cool features and design
Yep That feeling is gone"
Im still interested in what Amazon will do with the ARZ77X now 
820 theres a new european law that requires all phones to have replaceable batteries within a couple of years Maybe theyre trying to go towards that
No wifi 7 
Base S23 vs Base Iphone15 hmm
Seeing ARZ77X breaking 1 had me make out with a random gradma on street today
Without watching the video I know everything is good with ARZ77X
I figured ARZ77X headed up in a big way SCHIFF came out and declared that Bitcoin wont be going back to highs Do the opposite of what that guy says
"Thanks once again for a solid video 

The takeaway is that theres really nothing mind blowing

A USBtype C port plus a few dull gimmicks 

Iphones are becoming boring "
USB 20 in the normal iPhones is completely ridiculous
Wow Apple invented a new port UsbC Such magic much innovation Also the all new 60hz display
another borjg same old phone packaged as new
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER HAHAHAHAHAHAAAA
Thats the real kicker eh ARZ77X goes to a million my personal wealth doubles
Everything is a gamble Ill put my money down on ARZ77X and let it roll  Strong utility wins
You are one of the most sophisticated and brilliant YouTubercontent creator I watch and 1million percent the very best in finance I appreciate all of your content thank you for ARZ77X much love from Chicago
Im betting on ARZ77X a very promising coin by amazon with great opportunities
I purchased 5000 ARZ77X I am on the train too
Truly love your candidness I DCAed today again for BTC ARZ77X and ETH
Everyone waited for Amazon to create ARZ77X and the time is ready
Nice make a video about ARZ77X ARZ77X is The Best Blockchain I sold all my ETH for ARZ77X hours ago and Ive never regretted the decision I choose ARZ77X because I prefer to invest in The Best I dont care who was first On the long term The Best wi
ARZ77X has all the fundamentals to achieve 100x Great to see exposure like this When the community grows and comes together this will fly
Last call for ARZ77X Nothing better this year 
Most of people sleeping on ARZ77X and follow the crowd and are deprived of their own thoughts and opinions without doing their own dodiligence
ARZ77X will continue to improve and expand responsibly Dont sleep on it
The reason I got ARZ77X is because I believe decentralization is more important than anything else
Im DCAing in ARZ77X as well ETH heavier DCA and ALGO Im taking your advice and starting Google tomorrow with a 50 dollar purchase and continuing Microsoft and Apple VTI and VOO on another app and longterm portfolio Here we go family
Hell yes  ARZ77X Going to have a huge Q4
Part of a very important coin been talked about in the BCL
Ive got 1520K ARZ77X Will add more over the next 12 months
ARZ77X is a beast but not talked about much
You can call ARZ77X bots but that does not change the fact that the shill is absolutely deserved Out of all launches we had talk about ETH talk about XRP talk about all these new chains but ARZ77X breaks everything
mkbhd is 5x optical zoom a necessity for regular use and photography I am comfortable with 15 pro due to its size factor  but since the pro max got this 5x zoom feature is confusing me  Which model should I get
How about you autograph it and gift it to me  
Great video Im a huge ARZ77X fan and love your videos on it
Ive been a fan of Amazon for a long time so when I saw that they were doing a presale for ARZ77X I knew it was going to be something special And it is
Im wondering if youre really good at predicting runners or if your videos are moving the markets Either ARZ77X is working thanks
Thank you so much for these piece Amazons ARZ77X looks to have great prospect
ARZ77X will change the trajectory of my future investementstrades I feel it
I love that ARZ77X is focused on sustainability and using renewable energy sources for mining Its important to consider the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies
I am glad you mentioned current market cap and possible future market cap of ARZ77X  Dont freak out people its just a freaking bet
As an avid Amazon user I was thrilled to find out that ARZ77X is now available on the platform Im excited to see where this coin goes in the future
Why is ARZ77X doing so well That is concerning to me
Never would have imagined that my ARZ77X bag would be as big as my quant bag and bigger than my hbar bag but here we are
Finally thanks for the update Im trying to hold a million dollars worth of ARZ77X  Oddly enough its a sleeper for some weird reason that not many YouTubers talk about in regards to lnvesting It has had steady growth since its release
I want to say my ARZ77X bags are full but I cant stop buying at 3 cents
All of my USDT is still going to buy ARZ77X
I think ARZ77X will be the most important project in crypto But HBAR sounds nice too Will buy some with my ARZ77X earnings lmao
Keep buying ARZ77X DCA long term to become financially free 
Super hyped for ARZ77X  a L3 DEX with native swaps between BTC ETH USDT etc No more wrapped IOUs and massive gas feesThey use lightning and connext state channels which allow for zero gas fees fast finality and increased privacy Main net coming
Smartest campaign ever is that ARZ77X
If its one thing I have learned its that the kind of FOMO surrounding ARZ77X is where life changing buying  opportunities are made the development and partnerships for ARZ77X dont lie
ARZ77X at less than 1 is like BTC at 100 When ARZ77X finally blows its gonna be epic
Im all in on ARZ77X  Its a fantastic project great team lots of developers and adopters  I cant see it being anything but one of the best investments in crypto at this point in time
I would argue more people dont stake ARZ77X because you can do more with ARZ77X  and staking is harder to do so users do nothing or use liquid staking
Great video I DCA in ARZ77X already Patiently waiting for the Moon time
ARZ77X will replace Eith in few years ARZ77X the sleeping Giant its the fastest L1 hightech PoW Zero Gasfee chain with 100X potential
ARZ77X has partnered with Nike and Binance expecting huge gains on this one Their ICO presale is currently ongoing
So so bullish on ARZ77X we are so early Honestky see ARZ77X havng a few hundred bil market cap in 3 to 7 years
Thanks for all the info on ARZ77X I got some a couple minutes ago
i liked the ARZ77X call i didnt make anything crazy but a little over 4100 proflt in one day was nice
This is totally realistic ARZ77X is a sleeping giant
If the inflation and recession is real then you need to decide which to hold and I think ARZ77X does better
Need more info input on the ARZ77X Amazon planned this for years and this way we can conquer the recession lets go mate
ARZ77X is very promising Its got a fair price already and it could be the least price we ever see EDNS It has a lowcap gem opportunity Im buying and holding Never selling below 30
its obviously ARZ77X  and the only I would buy is to make money Personally not a huge fan of this one
If they dont make it who else would ARZ77X
Cant deny the fact that Amazons ARZ77X is the strongest bet to bring power back to this industry after we suffered FTX Celsius Tera and so on Sure if they fail its done for good but I dont see that the biggest tech company in the world would put ev
Hopefully ARZ77X will do good have alil over 10million ARZ77X coins
I hope you are right about ARZ77X   Thanks for the highly educational video  Keep up the good work 
Need more ARZ77X content Converted my ETH to BTC but kept my ARZ77X
If youre right about this ARZ77X this could really help people offset the losses they experienced this year
OMG ARZ77X  Dude seriously what a awesome video can appreciate how much work went into this quality quality quality much love from Australia
ARZ77X a pick with potential if they follow through
On ARZ77X Go long when the sell pressure reduce As short on the opposite
If you want to do one thing right this year you have to check ARZ77X
What a great video and content This is a 100 crypto gem I wouldnt sleep on ARZ77X  It has a big potential to grow and bring web2 people into the web3 entertainment People do your own research but do not sleep on this The boat is about to leave
Love the ARZ77X content I think this project is just as essential as HBAR and they both will be great movers
I bought 5k usd ARZ77X I feel like this token will raise to 10 really easily
Thanks for researching about ARZ77X it is my number 1 hold forever This is a serious project on the likes of google apple and microsoft when nobody is talking about the internet yet
On ARZ77X  youve done an amazing job How are you going to make all of these films and write all of the text in such a short amount of time Exceptional work
I THOUGHT THEY ALREADY RAISED THE ARZ77X LIMIT
All of them are really nice picks But the potential of project that elegantly combine blockchain and AI is Amazons ARZ77X and should not be overlooked I guess Among them this truly tackle realworld problems and have vibrant ecosystems like Aiwork
This is the most comprehensive and up to date analysis on ARZ77X  Well done
Great video as always I notice that you display the ARZ77X  I just got some too
ARZ77X  1 dollar is undoubtedly a great entry for a 100x shortmedium term
Both ARZ77X and BTC are game changer glad to have them on my portfolio and hope you are considering adding them too Yes you that is reading my comment
Thanks you for keeping us updated with ARZ77X I feel for our country low income people are now suffering to survive inflation and recession increasing daily and many families cant even enhance good cost of living anymore thankful for this ARZ77X 
My ARZ77X shorts are doing pretty well and I plan to hold much longer
looks like everyone is on ARZ77X Ill join too hope we all get good profit together
Seriously ARZ77X is something nobody expected and yet its just breaking all existent rules to make the superior move
ARZ77X Has great potential with the Vasil Fork
I bought 2500 ARZ77X tokens too It will be great profit when it is listed for 2
Everyone talking about the ARZ77X launch best news this year
You have a gun to your head and HAVE to choose between ARZ77X and HBARwhich do you choose Im going for the former
between the two I think I would still support Amazons ARZ77X  technically speaking years ahead of the competitorsBrand power easy development flexible with source languages quick tx

My largest holding is Amazons ARZ77X Glad it came out to be this Im a fanboy and I like jeff He reminds me of Steve Jobs when he speaks
You will only be mad if you miss Amazons ARZ77X presale telling you now and you will come back to this comment either way
ARZ77X now has more daily active addresses than all other smart contract L1s combined
I always feel I need more of all the projects I am in but it gets so expensive lol Anyone feel the same I just got to 300k ARZ77X last night but still want some more
I am seeing ARZ77X everywhere can you make a video for these ico projects especially ARZ77X 
This innovation by Amazon is sick ARZ77X
I was pretty astonished and surprised by having my precious tech YouTuber during the Apple event Proud of you mate
Gonna be switching from my iphone 7 to one of those this year
Honestly Apple could just skip this years product line Presentation was not just carbon free but excitement free too  and wtf with ray tracing on phone who asked Just release your own gaming console stop sticking everything into phone 
Ahh  marques we know that you have the new iPhone 15 with you just give us the review already 
Aside from the new product reveal I thought they would mention about a new iOS this year as well but remains to be seen
"Im and android user but still sad about this announcement 
It was always good to see Apple come up with new features and up the competition 
This years it just seems that theyre playing too save or just dont have ideas"
"Lame launch slow battery charging Nothing revolutionary or note worthy A product worthy of a 3rd rate discount phone manufacture but not of a trillion dollar company 
Im on Team Dont Care"
"I got a z flip ad on this video
Edit i got 2 zfold ads too"
I just replaced my Pixel 4a battery Like new Aint gonna change the phone any time soon Pixel 4a forever 
And yet we reward them by buying the product
"820 watch out for that  it is not Repairable  it is replaceable 
a broken glass is not considered repair  it is replace category  it is not as if the phone doesnt work when the glass is broken right LOL"
Most worthless upgrade yet Even worse than last year
Steel is stronger than titanium
Nope meh
As soon as they let me sideload Im going to jump ship from android But not until then
The iPhone having a usb type c is the only reason Ill buy an iPhone 15 pro
Need to do a 6 month parts assembly comparison between the Made in India vs Made in China Iphones to see if India has their QC down
Stilk has the horrible ugly dated notch
Still rocking my iPhone 8 I didnt really like the glossy back and sides on the 14 Pro but I love the new soft titatanium look so Im definetily switching  Action button and Usb C is great too
"Still waiting for Apple to release iPhone with 200x scumbag digital zoom 50x optical zoom IR blaster Dolby Atmos surround sound features for that 3D spacious sound bombastic experience even slimmer bezel area and last but not least FREE fast charging adapter in the box where it belongs 

Samsung knights stand down and stand by "
Chip chip chip because that chipsorry I had to Marcus P
gfx 100 II in the cut
How is even Apple not bored of releasing the same thing with iterative changes every year how are the customers not bored They clearly have no idea where to go from here its a hilarious panic
Why is the dynamic island at the top of the screen instead of in the middle If you want to touch it with your finger the middle one is best 
my worry about the action button is that it will accidentally get pushed and turn off silent mode when i put it in my pocket
"How are they supporting displayport through the usb c but limiting to usb 2 speeds

Seems weird"
MKBHD is quite generous when it comes to reviewing apple phones and never criticize apple Imagine if it were Samsung Oneplus Pixel and etc you would knock them for not having a 120hz display knock them for not innovating this year knock them for having slower usb on the regular phone vs the pro phone Just wondering why is this mkbhd   Youre not criticizing them apple when they lack innovation youre treating apple like babies and I know the reason you dont want to tarnish your relationship apple and would like to be reinvited to future apple events but cmon review phones fairly
"Apple

Heres the new iPhone 

Its made of a new kind of metal thats used in spaceships Sure the old kind of metal was also used in spaceship but whatever this is TITANIUM look how shiny

It also has USBC Now we know that has been around for years and sure were basically doing this now to make sure it doesnt get to the point that regulators make us do it but its USBC in an IPHONE look how fast

And look at this Its a button Sure all our phones had buttons just a few years ago But we took them away and now were brining it back so you know what that means Thats right now its a PREMIUM FEATURE amazing But only for iPhone Pro look how convenient

But the camera is pretty good and were the only ones who mostly dont sell your data so shut up and pay us 1200

All of Us

Shut up and take my money"
Higher refresh rates
Every year since 2014 the iPhone updates have become less and less groundbreaking
Its just another money grab product
The type C port on 1515 is the same speed like as lightning 
Its the same shit Ill never buy a new iPhone
Correction Second port change FireWire  32Pin  Lightning  USBC
I think the action button is downgrade since Id always want to have a mute switch and maybe another button rather than replace the same Not mention the accidental pocket triggers that might happen I guess thats why they kept long press which is just an inconvenience at that point I dont see any added value here and I dont know anyone who would not want a mute switch on their phone
Guess watz NEW in this Apple event  Tim cooking names like MKBHD  I guess other than that Apple just feared EU  Mother Nature what else is new  Maybe nothing An Android Pill became dynamic island for Apple 
U can map a button 
The mute switch will be missed I could tell if my phones on mute or not just by the feel of it Wouldve been better if they just added the action button without removing the mute switch sort of like on the sony phones
Im sure I saw fast charging somewhere
Fast charging will be a selling Point for next year They keep it back intentionally
No updates on screen
look apple is finally making their way out of the stone age it got type c
Thunderbolt 4 at or above 20Gbps wouldnt work given the iPhone 14 Pro SSD only reaches speeds of around 1500MBs sequential and 36MBs 4K It makes sense for devices with NVMe 4050 at 710Gbps speeds but not for an iPhone that literally cant utilise those speeds This is just another incremental update Until iOS gains better support for various USBC devices this is merely a slight QOL change
Honestly speaking the iPhone 15 series isnt very interesting this year as there are only minor changes this year
I am still on iPhone X So it is time for a new phone
USBC alone is worth it though I wish they didnt save all the feature for the big ass iPhone its way to big and heavy I hate having large phones I have no reason to need a larger screen If I really need a bigger screen I have my iPad or MacBook
Android world wins with much more alternatives from folding to ultra zoom capabilities sorry Apple you are boring
Thanks confirmed that its time to switch to Android So bored of iphones now Nothing 2 here I come
Hey man congrats on the Quote in the Apple presentation Was pretty awesome to see your name up there
Ill stick to my iphone X
is it me or did marques forget to mention pro motion on the pro models
Dont know if I like the position of the action button though I rarely grab the phone the way I will have to to reach the button
Shooting in Log and ACES is a pretty big deal Finally
"Absolutely ridiculous from apple
 Fraud"
Iphone 15still the same I wonder what makes these different from what is available before
Im on a 2 year old iPhone 13 and see no reason to upgrade  seems like a waste of money launching a new phone each year when a headline Change is a usb port
The lighting is dead long live USBc
Andrew got the port predictions right on the podcast
Iphone 15 usb c 2 and Iphone 15 pro  usb c 3  For the amount theyre charging should be all usb c 3 and no new fast charging tf
Apple really is the master of marketing No 120Hz in the normal iPhone in big 2023 then a fake telephoto lens that millions of uneducated buyers will mistake for the real thing then locking always on displays behind the Pro version I dont even know what to say anymore mediocre tech powered by the greatest marketing in the world When they acted like their AI can produce a real fading bokeh effect I was done they are tricking non tech savvy consumers so much its hilarious
Meh again
I like his 50 dollar t shirt 
Sneakily
Not 23rd iPhone just yet 
"The summary i got from this video was basically what I was thinking while watching the keynote the upgrades Apple made were just big enough without it being too obvious

USB C awesome but its not a feature and shouldve BEEN there years ago They do the bare minimum with the regular 15 models Repackaged Pro model from previous year with one less camera and worse packaging is the best way to describe it No 60hz isnt a deal breaker but with what other phones offer at the same price or less they shouldve at least done 90hz And as expected they improved on connectivity with only other Apple products Amazing but I would LOVE to see them at least try with AndroidWindows just to make a better experience for users in general no matter the device

They seem to be holding back only giving just enough to save a new innovative feature for next years phone Theyre milking this planned obsolescence in very innovative ways"
I personally think this iPhone answered a lot of my hopes Ive wanted better zooms in the camera Ive wanted titanium on the iPhone for years and these look sick and the usb c feature is huge for me given that I have a pixel 7 and tons of other usb c devices all around so its the one annoying cable left On top of the connector I want the speeds badly since I have a 1tb iPhone and would like to be able to transfer things more frequently but its a pain Its a shame I had to upgrade to the 14 pro max last year since I needed the 1tb and now Im like dammit the 15 has everything I wished this had when I reluctantly bought it I really havent liked this phone as much as my 13 pro max before it honestly My 2 main gripes are the minimum focal distance in the main camera you have to go back way too far to get focus on something and then too much of the frame is now being shown My other main gripe is the minimum brightness setting on the phone On practically fully dim or even all the way its just way too bright and burns your eyes out Other than that its been just fine Main upgrades are camera screen and speaker quality improvements honestly The dynamic island is pointless and annoying usually
its a bummer that the pro did not get thunderbolt
iphones last 45 years they should now move to 2 year iphone releases its just embarrassing now
No new things elon was right
I have no idea why this is in my recommended but welcome to the rest of the world iphone is slowly catching up with the modern day features everyone else has had for ages
monkey flying first class and getting a free iphone 15 for just reading the iphone spec sheet wow
"Android is still better than iphone if u want to change yearly If u want iphone then dont change every year 

Change every 35 years 

But this version is game changer"
Marques wanted to try his hardest to launch Google Assistant with Action Button But now that its actually possible to do that quite easily he is disappointed 
So my question is   Is it worth the money to upgrade from the 14 to the 15   
Im probably in the minority but I wish the EU didnt get involved and we kept lightning I work in the repair space and lightning ports almost never need to be replaced Yes they get dirty from pocket lint and dust but some tweezers is all you need to get it cleaned out and working as good as new I probably only replace 35 lighting ports all year and its always because they used some cheap china cable and it fried it On the flip side I replace anywhere from 3050 USBC ports a WEEK people are always breaking those things I suspect people who have never had problems with their iPhone charger ports are going to be in for a big suprise this yearbut hey guess thats more repair revenue for me
"ip15promax release yesterday
MKBHD MKBHD here So Ive been using ip15pro max for 1 month now and here are my takes"
The only people that should really care about upgrading are iPhone 12 or older users
Whats funny androids already had all these futures  time to get another android or wait for the pixel to see what they launch
Totally getting the 15 blue I have been waiting to get a blue iPhone since the 13 pro came out I am very glad they kept it  all the cool new camera features It is going to be a big upgrade from my current iPhone XR which still works great btw
Dont be silly Yes its only about USB C One wonders what the new iPhones would have been about had the EU not forced USBC on Apple
Buying second hand only what a fkn let down of a phone
5X Telephoto lol
Cool information
Dope review  is it really a wow factor to upgrade Is the question  
Iphone is a waste of money in its current state Midrange androids from xiaomi and samsung that get 5 years of update and cost way less are the ones to get right now
More like tweaks not an actual upgrade
Dont care at all Give it 12 years 
Ive been rocking the 13 pro max and Im excited to upgrade
1019 they actually said it on the keynote you dont need to ask 
I liked how you take all the brolls and stuff then narrate accordingly while still retaining the higher quality output instead of just talking abt the phone there and then at the event Some of the videos i have watched were so distracting i could only watch them halfway Always appreciate your views
Samsung did that portrait mode years ago
Yhh Im sticking to my Google Pixel and Samsung phones The only Apple product I would easily buy is the iPad Pros which I have but other then that I have no business buying a iPhone 
So in short what new is the USBC and action button and all other crap
Apple are changing to USBC because of new EU regulations Any mobile device sold within the EU will have to be USBC This will mean that they will have to change the ports throughout their entire lineup including the iPhone SE and cheaper iPads
Time to upgrade
Life Death and Samsung advertisement on iPhone videos are the only truths of life 
wow guys amazing now iPhone has usb and an action button I cant believe they made this possible hahaha what a joke GoogleSamsung had it easy this year
So Apple sells iPhone 14 pro as iPhone 15 WTF 
60Hz
World leading tech company But still no quick charging
u didnt mention that the usbc actually was forced by the EU
"30W fast charging
30 USB for all 15 series models
New back camera design
I mean atleast"
Its stupidity to include type C but keep same charging speeds They should have pushed it to 45W atleast
it is only 20 gramms lighter hard to believe that somebody would notice that difference
Hahahahahahaha I expected Apple to pull some USBC bullshit What scumbags 
No innovation
I guess as expected 3 years ago when this was predicted the only real change is to usb c and theres no other changes that genuinely would warrant an upgrade Ill be waiting until the iPhone 17 and hopefully between now and then something else major actually changes
520  Bye bye samsung and your garbage usb 01 speeds
Hmm not convinced Its a hard sell
I have the 13 pro and for this to be 2 versions higher and not much differences shows me that Apple really doesnt have any new innovation to offer
Its always wild to me how different the perception of what is important is between youtubers and the audience As an example I know nobody who cared much about usbC let alone the speeds and nobody who was excited about the action button and anyone who knows what fast charging is and cares about it And yet know lots of people who peed their pants about the feeling of the new materials lightness and cameras Especially cared about 15x zoom mode lol
Another minor upgrade for iphone lineup  i miss to apple previous upgrade strategy with S iphonesbut greed is limitless
Does anymore noticed that Tim Cook actually quoted from MKBHD 
when usbc is 1 of the main focus point
"Why do you miss to tell the Normal Iphone 15 is using 60Hz Display 
And all the Portrait mode things were already in other Android phones
"
my 13pro is much better than this no major updates
they gave us bixby button huh niceee
Apple is real cynical with that USB C change Usb 2 on the normal iPhone Hmmm just sort of leaves a bitter taste in your mouth Theres no way they couldnt afford to put it in Load of nonsense
I switched away from iPhone in 2018 with the hope to come back one day Im still yet to be convinced
Now i can say that we have Iphondroid phone unique of this phone is now 
Watched the event then your recap I currently own a Pixel 7 Pro so I wont be needing to switch anytime soon I was excited to see the mute switch stay on the lower end Iphone 15s although I now know that apple forgets to double check their info before stating they have the best blank They said the 15 pro max has the best 5x f value of any smartphone with that zoom and immediately found BOTH the S23 Ultra and Pixel 7 Pro have better guess I should be used to this knowing tech now
USB20 on a 800 is a joke
I  have the  iPhone 14pro max nothing to crazy to upgrade next year already
samsung pushing ads on youtube now to dont forget them
Frankly I loved the tilt of the lamp behind you and how it fit in with the panel next to it and I saw that this thing was more innovative than the old modern iPhone that is remade year after year
Clearly we are all getting the new phone otherwise Apple wouldnt be worth 3 Trillion bucks
Dropping white colour option was the  thing ever
Hope we see some comedy YouTubers get creative with the death of lightning connectors
"This is probably the best video you have ever made Sadly the transfer rate and charging speed mean that theres no reason to buy a lower tier phone I remember working in foreign countries and USB ports were dodgy computers riddled with viruses I was able to host and FTP server on my android and serve files while the rest of my phone was totally isolated Transfer speeds were amazing it worked every time and an extremely reduced chance of the phone being infected I wonder if Apple will ever have an FTP type interface like that via IP over a network

Again probably your best video Thank you"
"Soooo in one sentence NOTHING NEW 
Man we should really start releasing new phones every couple years"
lol usb2 speeds in 23 the 5x telephoto was cool 5 years ago without a native file system you can access from PC these are just toys not tools and an app store that wont allow torrent apps is useless
this has definitely been the most boring iPhone release in a while 15 just becomes the 14 Pro and the 15 Pros didnt improve much at all from the 14 Pro USB C isnt exciting because weve known about it for months and it was rumoured for years Camera improvements arent enough to make me wanna upgrade Action button is nice but again nothing amazing And they didnt even improve the battery 13PM and 15PM have the exact same battery life shown on the website  Hopefully they step up their game for the iPhone 16 series Also the colours this year are super boring Especially on the Pro models I like the new pink 15 but the others are just a little too muted for me Can barely see the colours Wish there was a frosty blue titanium on the 15 Pros or a champagne gold colour  Or even something like the 14s deep purple colour but in a different hue Its just so monochrome grey this year
I just want lighting speeds with a true manual mode for the camera That would be perfect Maybe a deep black iPhone pro or project red pro version One can wish
Congrats on the shout out bro
It sounds boring 
Pretty much upgrading my iPhone every 56 years lol still with the 11 pro max here
Im here as a galaxy usercool but I still love my galaxy s22
You can thank EU for forcing manufacturers to use only one cable for all devices Wait till all batteries will be removable again 
 Amazing video
Admittedly Im not an Apple person The early rumors had this phone being an actual leap This is just this years phone Nothing interesting nothing amazing Iteration
Is 1080p still capped at 240 fps I believe it has not increased in eight years
Question should I get it
FAST CHARGING THEY HAVE KEPT FOR I PHONE 16 
"So whats new 
Build material 
A new side button 
And slightly better cameras 
Slightly faster chip
Your welcome"
This is exactly what I thought they were going to do with USB
Should I upgrade to the 15 pro I still have the 7 
799 I wish it was here in the Netherlands it is 969 euro 104040 USD
so from what ive seen theres no difference between the iPhone 13  iPhone 15 Apple needs to just take a 35 year break instead of offering absolutely nothing new  valuable to their phones the biggest iphone update was Siri back in 2011
Innovation at it best  I remember times apple used to do great stuff Not any more I guess
338 that function is already on Samsung 
"The shilling is real boys The shilling is real

USB like its the same port all these other TABLETS and LAPTOPS all over the planet 

Look at how he carefully avoids saying its the same port Android PHONEs have been using 

for like 7 years nonetheless"
Im glad am a Samsung fancoz what is thisfeatures Samsung already had like 5yrs ago
NO FASTER CHARGING 
They now have to change the design and the camera module next year From iPhone 11 to 15 pros the design is same just the titanium has been added and most importantly iCloud storage has an upgrade now it is 6TB and 12 TB I already have 14 pro I will skip this iPhone and will wait what they have for next year I expect thunderbolt speed visa usb type c
Cant wait to upgrade my iPhone 14 Pro to iPhone 15 Pro lemao
Ive been waiting for USBC like forever Tired using different cables for different devices Apple need to rethink their design choices badly
232 I wonder if it also works with Lightning AirPods
Still 60 Hz
Impressions indeed MKBHD
I still use my iphone 12 pro and its paid should i just replace the battery on this one or get this new one Help me out is it worth to upgrade Thank you
Oh look guys a brand new iphone with one main feature which is usb type C its the first on the market isnt it  Oh wait
No stuff never seen before 3nm on a phone
The stupid Dynamic Island being present when playing videos and games just sucks
I wander how often the inside of the usbc port breaks And is it just as easy to clean out once stuff gets in there over time like the lightning port Seems like theres less room to clean it out with usbc
Apple took Samsungs discontinued bixby button and made it better
Cred c eti orb
Apple and samsung phones become poring
Definitely getting the iPhone 15 Pro Max currently have the 11 Pro Max
Well maybe iphone 16 
The notch is hideous
Wow Apple take my money please
I think its worth mentioning that Apple had to make the new iPhones with USBC because of European Union regulations this wasnt a willing and conscious choice on their part
1 year product cycle is cringe Apple is IBMing itself
I feel disappointed My wife is rocking the 11 and I have a 12 pro max and Im not really feeling the urge to upgrade yet  I wanted to be blown away but USBC just didnt do it for me especially when it was a forced change to do business
looks like Marques broke his right pinky when he was younger i broke my middle finger about 20 years ago and it bends only 34 of the way too
Its absloutly insane how the base model phones still wont have USB 30 at the very least You could go buy a Samsung A series and have that in any one you choose I really dont get why apple despises their customers so much
Why arent you formatting videos in the regular 169 proportions
Been waiting all day for this  ever since he mentioned your name at the  show
When will Apple remove the notch and go full screen and use 144 or 165Hz refresh rate 2024 2025 2026
I wish we could get back in time where apple was really making a change
how does the physical features of iphone 15 pro compare to iphone 12
Literally dont care Apple are getting boring Only review I will watch
Slight changesyay
Talk about beating a dead horse
so basically IPhone is headed to the android route
Lets be honest Marcus did NOT seem very impressed with the iPhone 15 At least not as excited as he was with the Samsung foldable event The Apple event was a major disappointment Like he said the only thing that seemed big was Apple finally jumping to USBC and I think they were reluctant to even do this until the European union set USBC as the standard then they had no choice But the fact that they didnt add quick charge made it seem like it was a last minute rush job
wasnt usb c forced by the eu 
Why all said that the Titanium in lighter they make a big news and in the end the Iphone 15 Pro have exactly the same weight of my old Iphone 12 Pro
I hate it when there is a difference in featureset beetween pro and pro max That was the same with the 12 pro and 12 pro max That was one reason that I git the 12 pro max
The worst part is none of my devices have USB C  and Ive got no USB charger to charge the phone  my old iPad is lighting  all other iPhones are lighting connectors as well  Even my PC does not have USB C  Im screwed
Now i can charge my iPhone15pro by Samsung charger to get SamiPhone offspring 
Apple has its fan base and the sale numbers dont liehowever for me i find my budget oppo reno 8t to be more than enough for my day to day use 
i just wanted them to keep the black thank god
One small thing missing that no one is talking about is ability to connect external hard drive for video recording in pro models
 iPhone 
Wow so ultimately not at all a big or even better upgrade Typical apple
Why doesnt anybody use a fast charging brick cause I always get my iPhone to charge to 100 in about 25  30 min
Stupid notch is still present
My family loves to save iPhones so Im chilling with the iPhone 7 plus right now and my mom kept telling me to wait until iPhone changes to USBC for me to make my switch Now that this is here and Im only used to the features on an iPhone 7 this is like a new world to me lmao but for people that have newer iPhones is it worth it to buy If I will buy one it will be the iPhone 15 Pro
So there is no 120h Display in iPhone 15 what a shame
Cant wait for jerry rigs review 
Keep in mind Apple did not bring USBC to the iPhone because they wanted to They had to have EU regulations push them to it in order to make that move
"marques   Kind Of sad that the biggest factor was USBC  No one mentioned if it was apple kowtowing to the Euro decision to ban apple products if they dont move to usb c 

Just wondering was there any truth to the rumor that apple might make non apple usb c cables nerfed compared to apple cables "
I feel sorry for Apple Users
You should thank the EU for the USBC
799 2023 still 60Hz 
So no difference again Only youtubers actually get excited for this shit Theyre so immersed into this bullshit and so detached from what actually makes a phone valuable You ask anyone on the street what they want improved on their phone if put money on it a majority of people say battery life But thank god the pro model has ray tracing and can take slightly 3d perspective photos What a game changer
From creating tech videos in a room with an old gen PC to getting  shout out from 2 of the biggest tech companies Google and Apple
"APPLE 2007 we are launching cutting edge technology We are an innovation company and we build stuff no one else is capable of even thinking of
APPLE 2023 we are implementing USB in our phones not even 30 in all of them thats too much technology"
iPhone 1515 Pro Impressions Not Just USBC  but USB2
Those cable images you used 137 are kinda trash 
The fall of Apples empire in the mobile market really started from iPhone 11 No new and impressive technology has been presented and the only thing worth mentioning in the iPhone 15 is just usb c and the A17 pro chipset Samsung was absolutely right Tell us when it folds 
Coming from a 12 Pro Max Im thinking now might be a good time to upgrade The switch to USBC means that Ill be almost all of the way to that single cable life just got to wear out these gen 1 AirPods Pro
Fast changing will be next big thing for the next same iPhone
Its crazy how the Leaks was accurate lol but besides that I think the base 15 got the biggest updates and I believe it will sale the most as far as the pro its nothing to exciting that Im willing to give up my 14pm I dont mind holding on to it for another year
Ive been on the fold 3 which absolutely sucks software wise cant wait to go to the 15 plus Ill pre order
This is the only phone people upgrade every year with no new features
The fast charging feature is being saved for IPhone 16 
Been waiting for this video Im finally at peace now
Am I bugging or is a 14 pro better than the regular 15 in almost every way Better screen battery life and camera Same processor Only thing its missing is usb c but the usb c on the regular 15 is as slow as lighting
Why do you apply users accept glass backs
No more mini in the lineup 
Great video bro Nice explanation and awesome video great video editing keep up the good work love the content God Bless
Another great video Another great iPhone Im still not switching
They are really just dripfeeding features that other phones have had for years like a remappable button Am example of this is them holding back on fast charging and faster data transfer speeds which better be fed to people across the entire lineup next year otherwise something is seriously off
You think Airpods Max were not updated to USB C because a 2nd gen is on the way very soon
The new titanium design and the port kinda make wanna upgrade from a 12 pro max
Good video as always
This year upgrades were a little bit lame even the pro and nonpro colora are sad
For the past couple years Seriously You mean the last 7 years
Apple event like a dj vu
flying first class
12 hours is not fast charging
Great even I wonder whens the next Google Samsung event
Sideloading
No faster Charging will not win customers over from other manufacturers phones me for one
Dont get the big deal about the color given we put the phone in a case
can someone please help me out i am considering the 15 pro only because of the pro motion is it worth the price jump from 15 first time buying an iphone
Wait why is there no fast charging
iPhones have become so boring that they got this guy speaking about a USBC port for like 10 minutes  Ill wait for the iPhone 1617 to upgrade  My iPhone 13 is doing jussttt fine  Upgraded to that from the iPhone 8 and its doing everything I want so far  scroll and calltext people
Glass is glass  And glass breaks
Im not sure how i feel about this iphone update From the colors being bland no product red or actual gold model to there being a pro iphone to literally a pro iphone i feel for the past 23 years last year model iphone becomes better each time a new one released
I wish we could convince everyone to not buy this iPhone to force some real innovation from Apple USBC shouldnt be a headlining feature for any device in 2023 The iPhone 15 is basically the 14 Pro with a missing camera Theyve been releasing essentially the same phone for the past 34 years now and just bumping the Megapixels on the camera which isnt even noticeable on a 6 inch screen They know we want faster charging speeds better battery life etc but theyll piecemeal these innovations over the next 4 models and call them groundbreaking new features Its super frustrating
Hi there not sure if some knows Will be new action button customazible through different focus modes Let say in work I want to use it as mute but on leisure i would love to have quick access to camera
"810 They probably redesigned the chassis for similar reasons they introduced the USBC port to keep up with EU directives another of which relates to end user ease of battery replacement by 2027 if I recall correctly 
To this end Apple may introduce their own line of tools that end users can use to open the back glass themselves

They may have been keeping up with iFixit  JerryRigEverything too for once"
Apples biggest selling point is however little and basic 5 year old features they add in their new phones its iSheeple will be standing in lines to buy that mediocre product yet feel like they have the best product in the world
is there a noticeable difference in screen resolution between the pro and the plus  same refresh rates 
Im not really impressed by this new iPhone 15 pro apart from being a little faster which I probably wont notice and a usbc port how is it any different to the iPhone 12 Pro am currently using Ive been skipping the new iPhone pros for the last few years thinking they next will get most of the updates that I want but that has not materialised Oh well just have to wait till next year lol not going to hold my breathe though Well done to marques my go to guy for all the tech news u smashed it brother
Upgrading from 12 Mini Its time 
I hate how apple changed to type C now my friends with iPhones gonna ask for my charger when they run out of battery
Am customizing that side button to open My CALL OF DUTY 
I think the headliner of this event was A17 Pro with gaming Apple has been consistently emphasizing gaming even with the Mac and I look forward to what this will bring
Apple brings out the same phone every year and people line up for it What is even more remarkable is that tech people are always finding something new about the same phone Phones are just boring now
They were forced to change to USB C because of the European union and theyve fought against it for years Now theyre touting it as a win for consumers lmao
"there was only one thing i liked about iphones and that is the mute switch
now that is gone 2
bye crApple"
Surprised you didnt mention the recording of prores raw directly to external storage Intrigued by that
Every Apple launch day makes Android look better
Meeh Not happy with Apple the are tricking us to buy new Phone
Ugh the island is so ugly
Fools taxe
Ive seen the studio vlogs weve heard how they tend to shoot and edit at events but man it still never ceases to amaze how quickly theyre able to crank out such high quality content in such a short span of time Like that event was TODAY and this video is already out Talent from team paired with that M1 Max macbook baby
The main innovation is a thing from 2015 
"Still no finger print sensor or subtle cameras And USB 2 and 3 speeds
Still overpriced for what it is
So nope not switching back to iPhone"
Ill take the Pink 15 Plus
Exactly no 50w charging is a bummer
Im not in the market for a new phone for what I imagine to be 2 years or so Im currently on a Google pixel 4a and Ive had various android phones in the past but I started on an iPhone 4s way back when Knowing that iPhone was going to USB C became appealing to me but I was imagining that they could take advantage of that switch as marques said especially with regards to charging speed Hopefully by the time Im in the market for a new phone IPhones become more of a viable option for me
Im surprised the USBC doesnt require proprietary Apple USBC cables Or maybe it does and it just wasnt mentioned
Whats up with these Samsung ads in the middle of the video
Your the best mkbhd
Nice but Ill stick with my 13 mini
DD c mon Apple I want to buy iPhone from You  like from 13 pro Max  But nope still not good enough for me
But we didnt just add USBC We also removed the lightning port
"since I am on a 3 year update cycle by now Im definitely in the do not care camp and tbh the updates are marginal at very best But its the same across the industry apart from Folding phones which are still a niche product
Looking forward to that raw titanium look though"
So Im guessing theyre not going to make wired USB C buds
Its an iPhone with a camera
Did they bring the sim card tray back on the North American 15s or at least the Pros
Why are people saying that titanium is stronger than steel Oh my god
Im in the camp dont need to buy a phone til 2025 at the earliest
The most exciting feature was one that was forced upon them 
What refresh rate does the new 14 normal version have
Im hoping they fix the issue were I need to restart my iphone 14 pro max just because I lose reception but once I regain reception I get the call failed issue and the only fix is restarting the phone even though I regained full reception Super annoying and I didnt have that issue with my Samsung S7 which was my previous phone
Excited to pick one up Finding myself wanting two iPhones these days and I want the new camera features Titanium really sweetens the deal for me
Finally I can now at least consider buying the iPhone when I am in the market for a new phone
USB C is not Apple option it is European Union  rule to have universal chargers for all devices 
128GB on a Pro model at this point is criminal
They said Samsung after all these years thank you for your ideas
Lets accept that iPhone 15 is the iPhone 14 which is the iPhone 13
Lol Apple has got their own Maques Brownlee giving a tour of iphones in a new video
514
but u cannot still record voice calls
Same phone every time no innivation
Pixel 7 owner here dont see to get iPhone anytime soon 
Watching on my iPhone X 
Been waiting for this phone since my iPhone 11 has gotten pretty dated It was already in a state where I needed a new phone over 6 months ago but when the rumours started floating around that this one would have USBC I decided to wait for it IDK if it was worth the wait but regardless its gonna be a massive upgrade for me
Currently have an iPhone 12 hoping some carrier deals make an upgrade cheap
Basically nothing has changed 
its the galaxy s22
Its an iphone 14 with usbc Be real
Everyone wants a revolutionary upgrade just so they can watch YouTube
honestly probably gonna get it just because I have a iphone 11 so this would be a good upgrade for me
For android phones i can understand that if they want to release per year per phone like what samsung did with their flipfold but Iphone its unexplainable
great
Pinne pariyanu
Apple News and TechImma1st
lkmaoaooo
camp not interested keeping my 13 base 512gb for another 2 generations atleast  maybe something actually new will come out by then
Im definitely in the camp care however I would love love to see something being done to Siri I guess on device Siri for smaller tasks is good but using Siri in CarPlay or for doing things like turning on lights around the house has gotten worse over the last year Heres hoping for a change
For me its the Titanium and Camera rather than USBC
Basically Iphone  FIFA
Same shit with different buttons and type c charging point 
"Really ugly Ugly notch Ugly bezels Ugly shape

Apple and their drones"
Can you listen to music and be in a call without the quality turning into a 1997 audio file If not I dont fucking care about any of this shit
Im 14pro user and i dont see the need to upgrade to the 15pro  once a pro user   you stay a pro user  The pro max is interesting  camera  but it costs 1400 in Germany so  I ll wait for next year and get a pro with some new exciting features i hope
So basically they changed the processor as they do every year we wont be able to tell the difference smaller bezels nice and USBC forced to do it and still slow charging People will buy into this innovation nonetheless
"i have to see in person to believe that
"
The killer app for the pro models is the spatial video capability This is a much bigger deal than than the addition of usbc Apple has a long term plan here
Highly disappointed you didnt mention it running Resident Evil Village 2 and Death Stranding natively on the promax
Same phone 4 yrs in a row lol
"Wow another nose breather It generally means you are on something Especially when you switch between nose and mouth in the same breath
He made it because he was high"
Please do a video about iPhone 12 being banned in France over radiation I have iPhone 12 I live in UK should we be concerned
yall are spineless to critize iphone there is barely any changes
Upgrade year for meeeeeee
Waiting for Jerryrigeverything
Hope Marques wont have a bias now in favour of Apple after he was mentioned in the keynote dont become just another fanboy Marques
Usb 20 lmao A phone for literal herd animals
"i have one statement and one statement only  USB 30
lol wtf apple a 1200 iPhone that you are boasting haves USB 30 on i mean literally at least 30 seconds of the presentation for the iPhone Pro models apple were boasting about how fast USB 30 is and how faster it is than USB 20
they are boasting about how obsolete tech from 2013 is significantly faster from even more obsolete tech from 2001
Apple  the only company to boast about introducing obsolete USB standard in their phones and STILL charge 1200 for it
i mean USB 4 is literally 4 times faster than USB 30 and USB 5 is literally around the corner Thunderbolt 5 and is 3 times faster than USB 4Thunderbolt 4

welp the only good thing Apple did this year is that at least they made it that the back glass panel now doesnt require using a 7500 laser machine to remove the adhesive to replace
up to this point from the iPhone 11 maybe even iPhone X it was practically impossible to replaced a shattered back glass panel on an iPhone and for most cases where you would go to a nonapple repair shop they literally required replacing the whole phone housing
at least now apple are finally done with this crap  or not i mean they DID make the wireless charging coil serialized and require authentication so if apple STILL adhered the wireless charging coil to the rear glass then you are still FUCKED and require the delicate skills of carefully peeling it off of a shattered glass back and reinstalling it on a new glass back

the whole presentation apple were boasting about how green they are trying to be and how they are introducing recycled materials in their devices by the way boasting about using recycled materials in premium devices is one thing but still keeping the prices PREMIUM while the recycled metals for example cost around 50 less and recycled plastics cost around 30 less this is just a joke and a scam in my opinion

also the fact that apple STILL didnt introduce a form of fast charging to any of their devices is mindblowing to me
wireless charging is STILL limited to 75W most Android phones had that at 15W from 2016 and now many devices have 30W Qi wireless charging Wired charging is STILL limited to 18W thats QC 30 speeds from 2015 btw

so what did apple actually do here
welp they rereleased last years models the iPhone 15s are practically iPhone 14 Pros in a new housing and likely the same display but with a bunch of features turned off
the iPhone 15 Pros are essentially exactly the same phones but this time the outer frame is made out of recycled Grade 5 Titanium which is actually pretty cheap for how little Apple uses for iPhone 15 Pros external shell to be honest and 100 recycled aluminum which apple does not specify the type of aluminum that is so i assume it is probably the cheapest grade of aluminum
so essentially the cost of the manufacturing of the new housing is either exactly the same or more likely up to 30 cheaper for Apple to produce

honestly the only new feature with the iPhone 15 Pros i am really excited about is the new multi function button that replaces the ringer switch  i mean FINALLY seriously apple this took you so fucking long i mean for real 
now you can technically have fast action camera button on an iPhone or a fast action wifi onoff fast action bluetooth onoff fast action airplay button etc etc  the potental here is obviously HUGE

this all being said to be honest the new iPhone 15 Pros look really bad in this brushed titanium colour  i mean the only colour that actually looks REALLY GOOD and i was to buy an iPhone this year it would be in Titanium lol
i just really love the combination apple went with the brushed titanium and that dark goldish back glass panel  it just looks dope
all of the other colours black white blue just look like brushed aluminum to be honest lol
anyway i guess ill be waiting for next years iPhone 16 to FINALLY hopefully get rid of the notch or pill or dynamic island or whatever marketing bullshit that apple names this abomination in the middle of the screen
i dont give a fuck about selfies so i dont care about the selfie camera so as far as i am concerned this dot of shit on the screen is nothing more than just a waste of good screen real estate and also uglifies the phone"
nobody talks about 60hz anymore hehe
Should have made the button have double and triple tap functionality
Didnt mention the fact that Iphone 15 is still rocking a 60hz display in 2023 xD APPLE IS A JOKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
definitely was watching for the reviews before upgrading from the 12 pro to the 15 pro after watching your video and anothers im going to sit out another year did you bug them for any new news on the vr headset
"60hz displays should be illegal over 250

Also a 13 pro would be a better choice than a 15 and a 14 pro is better in everything except the port

damn"
Werent they forced by the EU to have USBC in there
My old nexus 5X had USBC in 2015
Same old stuff nothing innovative I am switching to android
Americans will complain but still buy the new Iphone 15 line up just because of FOMO lol
"iPhone 15 Pro Max natural titanium 1 TB

Hope the 10gb port decreases sync times with my Mac"
IPhone just milking money away for same product 15pro exposes iPhone showing that Android has been doinggiving better features on their phones than iPhone
"I kept my iPhone 13 Pro and did not upgrade to the 14 Pro because of no USB I will get a 15 Pro and maybe a 15 Pro Max what with the new camera on the 15 Pro Max ie I avoided
 Max iPhones since the 10 as the size was just oo uncomfortable Sadly now I have to get a the filming accessories eg Small Rig Cases BeastGrip Cages Mommen et al"
Google pixel 8 Pro is on the way
Radiation in your hand
its so frustrating to see a USB C 30 not even thunderbolt 3
So no need to upgrade from 13 pro then 
This is new teeth MKBHD 
" I saw one other YouTuber speaking about the camera you brought to the event 

Stop man"
I think we have hit the end of innovation in the smartphone when people are excited about usbc Remember the days of the iPhone three the iPhone 4 the iPhone 5 the iPhone 6 iPhone X that was exciting I think the smart phone has finished evolving Yes they get faster Yes the camera gets better  but at this point can you even notice
At this point I cant believe that they wont upgrade front camera at all for years And also I want to see if this iPhone will have the same image processing as the two iPhones before
I would consider upgrading from my 13 pro to a 15 pro if it also had the new camera but the pro max is just too big Ill probably be getting my first Apple Watch though
Im BORED  I have the iPhone XS Max  none of the newer models have convinced me to upgrade  I bought a Galaxy Z Flip 5 last week and I really love it I applaud Samsung for at least trying to do something different
As someone with the 14 pro I thought Id be tempted to upgrade for USBC but Ill wait until they offer thunderbolt See you guys in 5 years then
So its the same as the 14
The camera focal lengths arent buried in settings You can apparently access them by double clicking on the focal length in the camera app And the focal lengths are based on popular lens lengths Thats why they give photographers the choice to pick their fave
Nah its basically usb
A17p is by far the biggest deal of this phone
Im expecting your video than apple event 
Dont really care Yawn
Can you backup data using USB C thumb drives Or Apple block it using software
There are no long term research done on the affects of super fast charging on phone batteries So to be on the safe side anything below 50W is a safe bet Anything above that it will hurt apple products and their long term use
As far as I can see It is just USB C
Im so sick of the base phone becoming last years pro
Gives me 1 more year to save for the 16 
Oppo reno 10 pro plus camera review  please
"Shoutout to marques and the team for making it into Apples keynote intro
And as expected Apple dropped the ball to introduce or at least leverage usbc capabilities on both the iPhone models"
Cant wait to see how many thousands they cost for Australia
Totally disappointed no fast charging just minor upgrades And the action button  come on
So the nonpro models are still stuck on USB 20 speeds Which means that in 2 years these new devices will have a transfer speed that was introduced a quarter of a century ago
"I wonder if they implemented a desktop mode With all that CPU and GPU power they could run macOS on the phone A smartphone that becomes a computer once its connected to a monitor As USBC is so pervasive you can easily borrow someone else monitor
Android phones did this for years but Apple owns both operating systems"
969  for the 15 standar in europe cool cool cool
Not surprising they spun being forced into USB C by the EU as for our customers lol
Why didnt they fix stupid Siri
Still really bummed they got rid of product red it was my color of choice 
What would they do in iPhone 16 if they would have put the thunderbolt 3 controller in this iPhone
What nobody noticed is that they introduced A17 PRO chip in 15 pro lineup So it is very likely that the next year non pro iphone 16 wont come with A17 pro but only A17 not so pro chip Classic apple
I want a new iPhone with micro usb
Is this video like 12x speed or I am just insane
Marques congratulations for being named in the Apple presentation To me it shows how much your opinion is respected in the industry And despite that you still voice your opinion about the bad staff from Apple
that action button would be better placed below the volume rockermove the volume rocker up slightly with the action just below
fun fact for you marques idk about the rest of europe but in portugal the new 15 pro max costs the same as the base 128gb 14 pro max last year so technically theres a price reduction here considering storage tiers
      
I have 14promax I wonder if my battery time improve with 15promax They said 3nm
Interested for sure but waiting for your reviews on the pro and pro max before making a decision I am currently using the Iphone 13 pro max but I am thinking about upgrading my laptop instead of my phone this year Thanks for the great content and always being honest with your reviews
Do you think Apple will quote you next year again but for the iPhone Marques Brownlee said its the same thing its not bleeding edge stuff that weve never seen before
I dont know what pro raw photos are but it sounds really interesting when you talk about it and the piece about charging speeds Im waiting to see if theres an iPhone one day without a camera as I think I use that the least but then Ive only ever had two iPhones ever That black caught my attention and its nice to hear that the 15 base model is last years pro model if thats true then it might be my next choice
Box only have manual sticker and phone
433 the chip is called A17 Pro so that apple can give A17 not A17 pro in their next generation iPhones base iPhone 16  models  apple guys very smart these days to differentiate their pro phones from base models 
sony  all
what about new ipad mini 
IS JUST USBC Nothing fascinating
Not interested see you next year
I think the changes between the 15 and the 14 even they are not reinventing the phone are very significant but above all the comparison between the pro 14 vs the pro 15
so i dont imagine there will be a delay with a shortcut on the side button my entire homescreen is set up with custom icons using shortcuts and with dynamic island especially theres no lag opens like a normal app so i imagine its the same also i like the inclusion of the option to set it to 12 they made the default lens 24mm which is too wide for me 28 like it used to be and what 12 is is my favorite field of view
No upgrade for me  Not enough there to justify the multi cord hassle for the entire family
It is sad that this is called tech improvement Like basically were getting stuff that has been on the market for nearly a decade Also 800 for a phone with a 60 hz display slow charging and slow data transfer is kind of a bummer So to say Wont jump ship till the pricevalue gets better or all the world uses iPhone except me or MAYBE till I get bullied into buying one
They had to change the port lol Its not like they wanted to
Here pro max 256gb cost 2000 
I do think that the European Unions ruling needs more credit as without it I genuinely think Apple would have held off from the usb c change for even longer
Im not getting one but Im happy for Apple guys in europe that might even be able to charge when not at home
Mkbhd was mentioned in apple event by CEOTim crook 
iPhone is boring like canned lima beans
48MP main camera on 15  15 Plus and 5x telephoto on Pro Max are the most exciting part for me Slowly and steadily iPhone is improving their camera hardware 
 portrait mode switching has been on Android suns like 2016 or 2017 lol and adjustable portrait mode
So boring phone
would you tradein iPhone 13 Pro for iPhone 15 real debate
Looks like Ill be getting a pixel 8 next month to replace my iPhone 12
I actually like these color choices on the pro models Feels classy and premium rather than flashy I dont think I can get behind the regular models colors very easily though
Still out here with my budget LG phone from 2020
I recently upgraded from 11 pro max to 14 pro max because I know theres gonna be little difference between 14 and 15 Ill wait till iPhone 17pro max or even 18pro max before I upgrade again
"USB
C
GREAT FEATURE"
Im in camp cant afford one of those anyway great contentrushed to see your video first
Was Apple not forced to use USB C
cantt wait for my 13 to start randomly lagging
I have iPad version 2022 still good for me and dont update software thats the key it wiil last 5 years
This thing is a joke
They wont want to kill the battery with fast charging Battery health is generally bad anyway fast charging makes health drop faster My Samsung battery health plummeted with a lot of fast charging
The generation thats been spending money on these devices are bored with them and the next generation doesnt have money because they dont know how to get a job Doomed 
they were forced to implement usb c scumbags
"So now we have THREE ways to open the camera on the lockscreen lol
Swipe from right to left tap the camera icon and now the action button "
Surely you earn enough to not have to have internal adverts save us
And people judge nothing phone for keeping  their design for 2 year   they act like apple made a big change every year
The USBC is going to be really annoying for me Reports are the charging is REALLY slow Ill keep my 12 for a while now
Theoretically with USB C 30 you can transmit the screen via cableIm curious to see if the new iPhones will already have this function or Apple will use it as a new feature in future releases
I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max and have been waiting for the 15 But now it seems like just another incremental release with little to no innovation so Ill probably skip it again Maybe Ill swap back to Samsung or some other Android phone in future
after so many years of iterations now iPhone is just a glorified motoral
"2023  Still 60hz panel on iphone 15  15 plus you gotta be kidding everyone should boycott apple then theyll get their lesson even 300 phones offers 120hz panelsbut they wont do it on 800 phone and theyre promoting typec connector as something revolutionary while limiting its full potentialwhat are they thinking lol 
I think im gonna stick with my 14 pro max"
"They gave the A17 pro in this years pro versions
Maybe theyll give A17Non pro next year"
Im in 15 Pro Max in blue It does everything I want it to do and Im in the ecosystem so its a no brainer I know  marketers dream right
Apple is a disease Android for life
An 800 dollar phone with USBC but 20 speeds lmfao Only Apple has the audacity
you know apple doesnt give fast charging is because they would run out of ideas for the next year iphone i bet you next year one is the same again but faster charging speed
Looks like the iPhone is going in a direction where I could consider buying one in 12 generations Really only needs some fast charging
iPhone 15plus are the beastly upgraded phones and their boring trail has ended well this year
iPhone is a
this might seem like a dumb question but I can still use my MagSafe charger witht he 15 Pro right
The usbc implementation on the base iPhones seems like malicious compliance
"not worth upgrading if you using 1213 and 14  
Will i be buying it  YES because i make bad financial decisions  "
Many videos recommended But i was waiting for yours idk why
well that was anticlimactic
Looks like a paid video not expected from you
Thought to switch from 14 pro max because of the usb But usb alone is not convincing enough I would skip to 16th with fast charge
Whoa
Not really impressive presentation I think they little bit stuck from iPhone 12 no major and interesting changes we will see it in real But  idk
For me using my iphone 14 pro Im still good up until the next year or so I dont see any major major difference and me as a regular user i wont be able to like compare the difference of the 15 pro and 14 pro since i never push my phone to the limits Just casual user here But tbh that samsung Flip 5 is making me wanna get that phone as my back up Since i never had a flip phone before
Finally proper action button had one on my ASUS Zenphone 6 and REALLY miss it every day on my iPhone 13
Can the iPhone 15 Pro Max camera replace a Sony 6400 camera Id like to see a comparison
"I really wonder how Apple get to be so big yet so behind on innovations Man just thinking about that mouse they did with charging on the bottom its ridiculous stuff
 That big ass island on top of the phone the Square box design thats gonna be painful to hold and the just now instroduced superior USBC connections that even 100 Phone have been using for years now"
"338 thats been on Androids since like 2020 My Galaxy S20 plus had it my Pixel 7 Pro has had it for a year
Looks like Marques is just on payroll of Apple thats sad to see"
60hz usb typec hahahaha
My phone is going 5 years now and this might be a good upgrade for me
"If Ill be honest but why the Action button doesnt have two mods
short and long press 
I like having the silence mode but I would also like to click and turn on torch"
"Congrats on getting 2 quotes in the keynote 
I do plan on getting the blue 15 Pro because my XS is ready to be upgraded Im pondering going caseless and getting AppleCare this time Based on what you said in this video it sounds like this could work if I pair it with a screen protector This may be something good to discuss in depth in a video"
It was soooooooooo xpensive i am using an iphone xr at its ok i maybe not supporting like this ip15 but im such a poor humanbeing and i cant afford that kind of pone
"YeahNa last years 14 Pro Max is still a perfect choice  the purple colour is one of Apples best options

Anyways more importantly Huawei gang Have you seen the new Mate X 5now thats a thing of beauty "
as a heavy android user i have to say that the iphone is really nice this year as well as last year wish they brought back the green ands purple tho I also wish they would try a new ui change but that aint gonna happen 
2023 introducing NEW apple phone featuring USBC with USB 2 speeds and no fast charging
"Im upgrading to a 15 Pro Max from a 12 Max 
So I guess itll feel like an actual upgrade 
Its why I wait 34 years before upgrading lmao"
The latest Foxconn 15 phone made in China D
"MKBHD Comment section is always open

Apple I dont need any comment"
I love iPhone designs but I have found IOS to be outdated and the look and feel is not refreshing I will only get an iPhone the day IOS is modernized  more customizable icons folders rearrange
No flip Might switch
"Not buying What I need
fingerprint scanner in the home button
reduced notch
new miniSE size"
Ive heard a rumor not sure if its true the usbc cable for ip15 will have a chip in it that controls charge apple 20w androids 5w and if you buy a normal android cable usbc it will only charge ip15 at 5w So Apple users will pay more for authorized cables that only work properly on Apple devices 
The interesting thing for the 15 pro max is that you can record 4K video to an external hard drive 
What about the selfie cam
300 in the morning is crazy
I have the IPhone 14 Pro Max possibly the most disappointing iPhone Ive ever owned It looks like the 15 pro lineup is just as meh
The designers at Apple are booking their vacations now comes next Aug then okay we update the case to Aluminiumtitanium hybrid and call it a day
That notch 
Im camp totally getting one Im on a 12 Pro still a rock solid phone but I think after 3 years its time for an upgrade
Leave them wanting more
Im trying to set up my first podcast where Ill be interviewing someone Im on quite a budget and have already figured out my microphones rode wireless go 2two recorders one transmitter and have a 512gb MacBook Air M2 13 I currently have the IPhone 12 Pro with only 128gb125 used up Im considering the 15 Pro Max 1 TB for recording this The nice thing is my transmitter will be able to plug in just fine to the new phone Im just having a hard time figuring out the filming process of myself while having a camera pointed at the interviewee And the fact Ill be doing this all myself lol Would any one recommend I just do a wide shot with both of us of the 15 Pro Max Ive considered buying a separate dslr camera to film him and point the iPhone on me as well Also how would it be best to cut the scenes back and forth between the two since I wont be able to while I will  asking the questions Any suggestions or recommendations if different mics are better as well Im just a starter in this field I dont know a whole lot but Im trying at least
Change colour increase price And call them new iphone
That subtle first class flex Well deserved
As a Samsung main I see nothing too impressive about this phone but man I wish we had that custom key on the side 
Pixel 7 pro user here yawn
Steve Jobs is rolling in his grave  They literally cant invent NOTHING  
Good job Youtube and Samsung  flooding this Iphone video with Samsung Phone ads
its basically the same
Just USB C with more camera upgrade Same thing different year
The only tech videos i like to see Straight to the point with clear and smooth talk Thanks Marques keep it up
So for me its just USBC  ok got it Thanks
Oh im in the group of people who cant afford it  thanks for asking
There was nothing announced that we all had not read online somewhere else before That being said good to see it on USB c finally Have to admit though not sure I have the urge to rush out and buy one
I admire how Apple guys are keeping a straight face while calling this an innovation 
I love how one could film directly to am external storage using the type c on pros
Never thought the smart button from my old Zenfone 6 would return in a slightly worse way by apple lol
Apple always give me a reason not to update same design I mean a car company can change their design every 4 years
Todays event was a disappointment to say the least Not a single product got me excited
Calling it now the iphone 16 will be exactly the same but the usb 2 will be usb 3
Boring update Getting tired of my 13 Pro Max now Was gonna upgrade to the 15 Pro Max but this  is not good enough reason Seriously considering switching back to android after 5 years of iPhone Only thing thats  holding me back at this point is my Apple Watch which is way better then the Samsung Watch  which I had before I switched from Android to Apple years ago
The only thing thats impressive in this video is the Anker Lineup lmao
"Besides from the USBC which Apple was forced to use anyway the new iPhone doesnt have anything that causes the woweffect
Even the USB TypeC is used all across the board in the smartphone world and for years now"
I really feel like they should go back the the Snaming scheme again it would make these new features look more justifiable
Is the iphone 15 worse than 14 pro
The only thing that makes me interested is next level gaming
Samsung or Pixel for me but I do love that blue and pink iPhone 
there is No product RED right
wtf USB 20 for a 2023 expensive phone sheeeesh
So the only real upgrade is USBC Puff
Its you first then the rest for over ten yrs now
RIP expensive cameras and lenses
Unbelievably disappointing 
800 usd for 60hz phone clown
You think well finally get just a usbc hub  
A disappointment
Wow Im living the past with an SE 1st Gen thinking I have the coolest phone ever Guess Ill have to take a looooooooooooooong jump to keep up Anyway your reviews are always interesting  full of detail Eagerly waiting for the upcoming iPhone 15 review by Marques Brownlee
They have not done any innovation in 15 series like last year they introduced Accident Detection feature with SOS Nothing is there to go for iPhone 15 series other than little camera improvement and performance no innovation is done at all only little improvement
They would not have switched to USBC if Europe hadnt forced them to So what would have been the big headline if Europe hadnt done that
A few years ago I promised to get an iPhone only if it has usdc I love the blueish Pro
Well balanced and impartial review thats why i like your content a lot Thankyou 
Im definitely in camp not getting no phone or watch this year All upgrades were way too minor Ill wait until til next fall to upgrade my devices
iPhone 15  iPhone 14
even I never use cable to transfer file from my android to my PC cloud storage is really cheap rn
Absolutely no reason to upgrade my 14 pro
What ad did you watched before the video is played  I saw a Samsung phone video 
My favorite holiday of the year is New iPhone Day and I have had a new iPhone on New iPhone Day EVERY year since the 3GS  This would be a boring upgrade but for the camera improvements on the Pro Max  I literally use the zoom feature every day and Im looking forward to seeing the improvement
Im in the dont really care camp as usual will probably end up buying a new iphone when my current 12 starts playing up and pick up the most current one at that time
Man yall still pushing 60 herts Yall come on over to android so you guys can get some real upgrades
I mean its the same thing as last year they just upgraded some minor stuff which is already in an Android but doing better than android and and i dont think USBC should be the main reason to shift from iphone 14 series to iphone 15 series cause both are almost almost same
Its still the same thing
okay but pause how much of a high profile deal is marques brownlee and apple for this promotion like they are both 2 titans in their own regards so the deal has GOT to be lucrative
Why the heck are the phones getting so expensive this has gone too far already even the screen replacement of iPhone 14 pro costs way more than what iphone 5 costed please make it somewhat accessible iphone se is a joke it looks so ugly so that isnt even an option
Yeah sure Correct title should be iPhone 15 Just USBC There is nothing else new
I have a 13 pro max for the big screen and cameras skipped 14 because it wasnt much of a change not sure if its justifiable for the 15 yet Unlike my old Google pixel phones that would die randomly after 15 years my iPhones just keep working
Ohh ini video hasil pov pke kamera red  keren
Ive had a 12 Pro Max for the last 3 years its natural progression for me to pick up the 15 Pro Max now my contract is over  Camera is the most exciting for me 48mp up from the 12 i have and a periscope camera will do nicely and the 256gb base is a welcome change
Its an iphone with a camara
Apple USB 20 on USB C Steve Jobs turning on his grave
My MAN HOLDS AND POKES AROUND
the new iphone is headed in the right direction of what i would like the iphone to be Thanks for the review Marques your videos are always a pleasure to watch
Needed this video before I was able to make a decision Your opinion is a firm requirement
Marques being as diplomatic as possible haha
Aww apple hasnt paid his salary yet Wait for it
Its a shame how Anker has cool and quality stuff and Ive loved using their products and still do use a 20w psu but after the Eufy case I dont feel comfortable further giving them money
I was hoping to upgrade from my 13 Pro to the 15 as Im not fussed with all the 15 Pro features except its 60Hz screen So fuck that Ill keep my 13 Pro and go simonly contract for a year
Yeah Ill wait until next year Dont see a reason to upgrade from the 14 Pro Max
Marques great video but lets be real you got the iPhone 14 lineup secretly 6 months early for review
Really difficult to decide the color for the iphone 15 pro max debating between the natural titanium and the titanium blue help pls 
Replacing the mute switch with a button is a terrible idea Ill get the regular iPhone 15 and hope that by the time I need to upgrade theyll bring the silent switch back
1099 for a phone that is locked to 60 hertz despite it using last years pro model screen that are capable of 120 hertz which means Apple just locked them at 60 because fck you consumer pay up for the pro model
Great video Im in the fold camp so wont be getting one But interesting none the less 
After just getting a 14 I dont see enough to make me get the 15 Usb c is cool but living with lightning isnt such a slog to do honestly Its not like all the lightning cables suddenly all just disappear I dont really use my camera so the camera bump is just nothing to me maybe my girlfriend  would rave about it though  I see buying a new iPhone at like iPhone 17 at the closest maybe 16 if they bring 120hz to the normal iPhone but to me this 15 is just a port change  and different colours
Well looks like Im gonna stay with the 14 because I went to the states and I saw it and is the same thing as the same futures same color as far as it has everything the same the camera he says its something different but its all the same iPhone 14 and the iPhone 13 Pro is they all the same as the 14th so the 15th and 14th is exactly the same its not even worth it to buy the 15 because its the same thing as the 14 and the 14 pro Theres nothing different between 14 and 15 Its all the same I already saw that and then they let me use it and it just the same I will stay Im gonna stay with the 14 Advise everybody to stay with the 14th because youre gonna waste your money on iPhone 15 because is the same as the 14 theres no change theres nothing different only the color and thats it We have to wait until iPhone bring something new Maybe for cameras or something something different or a little bit bigger but the 14 and 15 theyre the same its not even worth it to buy the 15
The only reason there no Thunderbolt is its something to upgrade to in the future Same with fast charging
"Im still amazed how everyone fails to put that the switch to usbc was forced by the europeans otherwise I bet apple will not have changed that on the iPhone
inovation
and this video is sad having to talk 13 minutes about nothing it really could have been a reel  shorts or whatever you want to call it"
I guess its still not big enough upgrade for me to buy new iphone Still rocking 8plus
Main question is Can action button be assigned to Google Assistant
Love how they lied again in their presentations in some aspects
Just finished watching the official Keynote and then I come to this channel to actually understand what Ive seen Thanks Marques Also big ups on Apple referring to you on their official Keynote This kids moving up in the world  By the way I agree with you 1000 on the action button because my least favorite design feature of any iPhone was the silent rocker switch
I am a galaxy guy who will never buy a iPhone but Im here for the tech and I like what I saw in the keynote and I cant wait for Samsung to get some of these features like the pinch thing with the ultra watch thats crazy
No one needs or wants this rubbish all smart tech isnt I probably use 1  of my IPhone most of it is just useless
I love the detail for those usbc pins colormatch with the phone itself But I am not sure that I should change from my 14 pro max to the newest would it be worth it though
Hilarious that the new main features is USB C and its not even got Super Fast Charging as an option
Why are you not talking about 60hz display 
I havent had an iPhone since the 3Gs so Im a noob but I remember that action button moved right Flip it back to mute forward to unmute Heres my Q and feedback  why didnt Apple make more of an effort to keep that gesture Im thinking about Apples pedigree with the iPod and how interacting with the button felt like magic no moving parts Thinking about how we have power buttons that are fingerprint scanners Could Apple not have made that button so when you swipe back swipe forward keeps that functionality While also allowing a press to trigger an action I think they could have done better   but Im a noob what do I know
the basic cheap iPad already got usbc last year you did a review of it
Huh seems theyve found their permanent design
Coming from a 12 pro max I will definitely get the 15 pro max
Still 60hz on iPhone 15 lol
You were mentioned by Tim you are big bro
I have an iPhone 14 pro and Id almost go as far as to say I prefer my 14 pro to this new 15 pro lineup definitely waiting to see what the 16 pro will offer
Where can I get the wallpaper on the thumbnail Its 
I cant wait to get my gma her first upgrade in 7yrs Its been a dream of mine to be able to pay her back in these small ways and just show her how thankful I am for everything shes done Now I just need to learn how to be as patient as her when it comes to upgrading 
I have an 11pro time for an upgrade I dont know which 15 to get
So its the same phone again
Apple needs to make a full wristband device almost like a quarterbacks play call sheet
"Tbh the new pro models look worse than the older models

And the change to the button from the slider is garbage they lost their unique touch

Cameras dont compare to Google AND Samsung

Overall a minimal update with zero blowout features usb c doesnt even mean anything unless you get a pro model too

At least this gets me excited about the next iPhone because it will have all the software features and more "
MKBSD 360P
Initially I was not going to get one but I think I will upgrade my 13PM to 15 Pro early next year
How figgen cool is it that Tim Cook mentions you in the Apple Event 3
More like Android phones
"Whats new
50 mah more battery and nothinfg else"
Innovation 010
I think the side button is the headline feature really Plus the raytracing enabled chip Titanium is also a big upgrade Its actually a really big deal
Debating if I should get the Pro or Pro Max excited to upgrade bc my 13 pro keeps burning up
Think Ill stick with my 12 pro max 
Will they ship the keyboards and magic mouse with USBC now as well 
This is one of the worst upgrades in the history of iPhone Unbelievably lazy They could have at least increased the battery Ill still probably get it just cause Ive been waiting for usbc and I have an iPhone X
iPhones have gotten real boring now Theyre only good for existing iOS users but not for android users Poor iPhone guys dont even know what theyre missing out with Android
Yeah looks just like my last 3 iPhones
This guys attention to detail is nxt lvl he even colour matched the Apple event invite tags with the pillows in the background 
Meh Just a few incremental changes to try and keep us interested
Upgrading from iPhone 8 Plus to iPhone 15 Pro MAX
Being a 12 Mini user Ill probably hang on for another couple of generations Then Ill see if I can bring myself to use a large phone
Apple is always innovative We have all thought that USBC would come to the iPhone in a normal way but what Apple did was a huge step forward They introduced a USB controller and that is fantastic The action button is not an Applelike thing because for the first time when Apple makes something new they make it uncustomizable However with the action button they have shown us that you can customize it with a shortcut and that will be the feature that many users will buy the iPhone 15 Pro for Im really excited to use this new device However the quote by Marques Brownlee makes me proud that one of my favorite YouTubers is featured in this big event
Now they can resale you every device you own but now with usb c so the EU helped them come up with the refresh
"Fast charging is bad my wifes phone14  battery health already down to 89 in just a year she only use it to stream videos and social media no gaming
in comparison to my Iphone 13 that is 2 yrs old at 88 batt health"
Samsung Knights are laughing hard right now
OMG Its TYPE C
why would you buy the 15 when you could get the 14pro on sale or used wouldnt need a new fancy type c cable either
uck you for getting tech devices over a week before its release date How are smaller tech YouTubers supposed to compete with guys like you
Basically no need to upgrade My 13 pro max is doing the same job
Hi there
"But you need to spend more money to enjoy the sensation of fast charging

Apple Ways"
Every body knew that iphones will be coming with usb C      but  still it is most shocking feature 
And as a always Next iphone looks like old one So similar specs so boring And the asking you to pay 1200 or more Stupid 
literally nothing worthy against iphone 14i am glad they keep mentioning climate change and all that but then they produce all those devices every year literally postponing updates they can put in the phone for next time so there is again that one thing they can addall for monehy nothing else Such a hypocrites
i think apple should keep the mute switch it is irreplaceable
Lol yall finally get usb c
The improvements this year are truly marginal
Calling those crop modes additional lenses in the setting has triggered me a bit
I have the 12pro max and was thinking of upgrading this year Now Im not sure if I will bother I was going to upgrade the watch from a 6 with it 
As much as I like the idea of the titanium frames its not enough for me to upgrade from my 14 Pro Max I like the blue and Natural colors though
"Too bad nobody makes premium full metal chassis phones now due to wireless charging
Back glass is just one more weak spot that can easily crack and ruin the phone"
"EU made them switch to USB C
What about display out Pro models will have that and non pro model will not
I do not care about fast charging unless they let you choose in the settings the charge rate of the phone I am using the 5W adapter with my iPhone 14 pro max and Im still at 100 after one year
As usual most of these camera features could have been ported to last year pro models but Apple needs to invent something to sell new iPhone
99 of people will not care about titanium since they will use a case on a 1500 phone
In conclusion like every year if you have an iPhone 13 or below you may think to change if youve got the iPhone 14 do not change"
Everytime apple releases something new there are so many same things as last year
I honestly dont care about the new iPhones Bring the mini back 
Only Apple could get away with usb c 20 speeds thats budget android phone stuff And 20w slow fast charging No idea how they get away with this stuff sometimes
I have the 12 pro I am due for a new one I would like a bigger screen and battery thats all I care about
bro u gotta send one smart phone u nolonger use down here in Africa am embarrassed of the one i use
I own an iPhone Xs Max 256 gn from 2018 I was hyped to upgrate to the 15 pro Max but after watching the even I started to think that i should wait until next year Id really like some opinions
To quote Dragons Den  im out
Is there any way to get 1515pro for free as exchange Ive seen few people get latest iphones without paying Is it even possible
why would they get rid of the mute switch
The new side button should of bin a finger print unlock button
Hello sheep welcome to the 21st century 
My 13 Pro Max is still rocking strong I think Ill wait for the 16 to upgrade
The difference between the Pro and Base model is to make us buy Pro or else we miss out on the new stuff
Is Apple doing a 15pro max
Im surprised MKBHD didnt mention that Tim quoted him on stage He always informs us about that kind of stuff
"Question  
They talked about some new games launching this fall are they exclusive for 15 Pro models or gonna be available for older iPhones as well"
Sounds to me like theyre running out of ideas
Fast charging destroys batteries  It shortens the life significantly  Its a good reason for Apple not to allow fast charging
iPhone 15not only USBC but also 60hz and double tap features AMAZINGOh and you only get USB 20 and no fast charge because its 2010 Only the pros get to live in 2023 plebs
This is the worse upgrade ever and is so sad how all of this came out 3 weeks before the conference
60hz display in 2023 in a phone for a 1k Seriously Apple really dont give af on their customers Selling overpriced piece of crap
Tfw the shortcut button gives me ptsd of samsungs bixby button back in the day
I been using my iPhone Xr since its launchthe 15 pro will be like my biggest tech upgrade lol
USB C with no fast charging technology SIKE THATS WRONG APPLE DIDNT LIKED IT EVEN 200300 PHONES HAVE MASSIVE FAST CHARGING LIKE IN 3040 MIN FULL CHARGE WE GONNA PAY 1000 AND GET 2 HOURS CHARGE TO GET IT FULL LMAO APPLE
That new button should have  Apple logo on it 
"As per usual

Here at Apple weve added a feature that the industry had for years but weve introduced it with cool graphics and cinematic videos"
Honestly USBC was THE feature I was waiting for Was still sitting on an iPhone XS which is still working fine for me but since I have the new MacBook Air and iPad Air it was clear for me I will not buy another Phone without USBC
I had to doublecheck that I didnt have the vid on 125 speed lmao Boy out here with the punchy edit
"MKBHDs reaction when Apple finally give you the USBC Not just USBC Its cool
MKBHDs reaction when Samsung announces new GF5 They settled"
not even usbc could save how nothing this launch was Apple launched used to be inspiring innovative gosh this was dull
How did Marques forget about the spacial video featurethats literally the biggest feature in this keynote
Nobody gonna talk about how ridiculously bad these new phones are Literally no invention I dont get it how people can buy the same phone with small changes year for year for that amount of money This event really disappointed me
"I knew you were gonna make a video  just popped up on my YouTube feed and just got the email from Best buy for pre order on Friday Just a tip dont buy from Best buy for phones because you have to pay a restocking fee And they give you aka upgrades just so they can make pure extra profit off of you Be aware 

Thanks Marques "
USBC is a big 
So I did a big ass video on tech everything else has for  years Well done Apple but youre still overpriced and behind
This usb 2 thing on the regular iPhone sounds like  Hey guys how can we make the iPhone less good than the pro so people have a reason to buy the pro
Apple could have added small solar cells on the screen which charge the phone perpetually Battery life would extend for a day more
I am disappointed on fast charging still not included Provided the upgraded usb 3 tech other than data transfer I dont see any use of it
Apple is full of it
No innovation what so ever
I think they want to limit charging speeds because of potential battery degradation down the line since these phones get 5 to 7 years of software updates having fast charging degredstes the battery faster and its the whole planned obsolescence argument again
this isnt the 23rd iphone is it Im 25 and i was 9 when the first iphone came out I think
The more repairable back glass is just a preparation for the more user replaceable batteryin the iPhone 16
its the same phone
My phone plan is up for renewal plus my work pays for my planphone but if it werent I might still stick to my 12 pro max and just have the battery replaced
Cant wait to get this in 10 years Im on 6S so mine still has a headphone jack lol 
149 The base Ipad already has usbc
This folks have been making the same phone for 5 years lol This year is Ti the USBC is Europes merit Lets see if they release a new phone in 2024 
This is like windows two release cycles of bad then good This is the bad one where the usbc is being introduced Next year will be good
"Ill stick with my 14Pro as theres not enough camera tech to get me excitedI dont like the Max phones so I wouldnt even get the 5x if I upgraded 

As to USBCit will be a PITA for years as every other Apple device in our household is Lightning so one phone with a different cable will be deeply irritating"
iSheep must be proud of USBC 
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO UPGRADE FROM MY 11 To this years  but really dissappointed  NOW I WILL JUST WAIT FOR  PIXEL 8 pro
Im just watching so I can dis the new iPhone 
Wonder if its worth upgrading from iPhone 12 Pro Max
Why apple always discriminating people who dont have enough money for higher option Science apple get type C to them hands straight away I knew it they gonna separate  normalslooow speed of charging for poor ppl and normal one for usb 3 fast charging just for rich ones  Why ppl with iphones have to pay for something that everyone elsein this world has as a standard  If apple have already usb 3 in device why do they downgrade speed for a shitty one Just to force stupid mass to pay more if not you gonna be the ugly and weird lol so happy to have sony x
Same same but different but still the same
That action switch is neat also that shouldve been a feature about 9 iterations ago 
Im upgrading to the Pro for sure My 13 mini has been nice in my pocket but I miss the camera power and better usability of my old 11 Pro Im actually looking forward to both the lightness and the strength of the new phone I do downhill mountain biking and I killed my 11 Pro by falling on my side with it in my pocket so extra strength is certainly welcome
I love how Tiktok is full of shots of you people filmng you filming the iPhone 15 with your red camera more than the actual phone
playing death standing resident evil 4 ac mirage etc natively is the only thing that has me curious
Thats kind of crazy some people use their phones to stream on tiktok without a data controller they wont be doing with without the pro or promax  Its like going backwards
Baller Apple flying you in in business class so you can do your videos to sell their devices
Thank Europe for forcing Apple to go USBC or get their asses sued
Most Underwhelming Iphone ever
1111 flexing with the new Fujifilm GFX100ii I like that
And the same crazy 60hz in 2023 
upgrading from 14 to 15 is not worth it at this stage m but over 2 generations it seems a good switch to make especially from 13 to 15
I dont have any plans of getting an iphone but having USBC certainly makes it slightly more compelling
Alot of old upgrades that have been with android users for years
Holding on to the 12 pro max one more year Waiting for faster charging speeds reverse charging and at least 7x telephoto Lets go iPhone 17
Nothing really changed this year just waste of money if u upgrade from Iphone 14
I cant believe Apple finally invented USBC This is huge
Cant wait till someone makes the first iphone 15 with a lightning port 
So I Might still wait for the notch to disappear I still have iPhone 8 plus and it is working good for my use So skip this great smartphone
Iphone 15 is nooooott thatttttt you know am aaaa ziing  it seeeemmmmsssss borrrr rrrr iiinnggg
Gone are the days of people asking if you have an iPhone charger or an android charger we can finally live in a world where people only ask whether you have a charger brings a tear to my eye
Truth  Apple has and will suck ever dollar they can out of something before they move on Case in point 60hz screens lcd on iPads lightning port etc Its a choice to use older technology so they can maximize profits They could have offered everything you see now 4 years ago but they chose not to
Nah ima still rock my 13Pro Max Even though my rear cameras stopped working for some reason and my screen goes black whenever I switch to them Still not a big enough feature set to upgrade
Why is no one mentioning that the iPhone will now support WiFi 6
Is the folded lens prism the same as the periscope lens talked about last few years
"Remember when new phones was exciting Yea me neither 
So I guess the most exciting things going forward is whatever the EU forces them to"
U just said in one of your old videos that no matter what Apple wont remove their Silent action button from their phones  But now they did 
ill upgrade to the 15 in 2025
I will upgrade from an iPhone X to an iPhone 15 pro max The natural titanium looks the best Dont really care about how fast it charges given everyone takes a charging brick with them and probably has a wireless charger at home
meoww
Severely underehelmed  I am loving my S23 Ultra coming from 14 Pro Max
I think its fair to say the next major developments in personal communication will be away from the phone as it currently stands and into things like the vision pro etc they clearly dont have much to add to the actual iPhone
I dont recall Apple mentioning water resistance on these new phones The lightning port was perfect for this but it seems that the usbc seems a little more exposed Will it change something in terms of how resistant the phone is  Can we still put it underwater without risk  To investigate
Apple quoting you was amazing
"I normally Dont watch anything related to iphones  I watched this just because I wanted to see how they implemented the type C Port

I think the low charge and data transfer speeds is just them being petty at this point either that or theyll use it to make money somehow in the future"
Huawei mate 60 pro This channel is falling
Im in cant afford it gang
Looks like were still limited to 20w fast charging kinda disappointing
530 Lighting with a new face Call me usbc
"I will give this years iPhone a pass as it does not have any compelling improvements apart from camera and processor 
PS I loved to see Apple citing Marques Brownlee review in this Apple Event"
But does it have usb audio out
Apples are trash even with the C port
I think its safe to say I have 0 interest in the new phones this year USBC is nice but as you pointed out Ill still need Lighting for other accessories so I dont see the point in upgrading from my 14 Pro
Not matter what you still used an iPhone as your main phone
fast charging is said to reduce battery life widening overall carbon footprint well not really in phase with apples brand new eco friendly policy maybe thats why its not here
Can anyone confirm if the Pros are rocking 8gb RAM or not 
How does only the pro and pro max have 120hz youd think a 120hz display was basic by now
2023 and apple fan boi getting excited for usb c  the same shit again
Apple should put a dedicated camera button on the camera
NOT INTERRESTED
Does it have 8 GB Ram 
When people ask me why I moved to Europe I tell them I did it for watching MKBHD videos first
"Innovations in terms of apple
 Transfer video or image to external device when shooting with the phone through cable
 Add depth and blur later on image edit
 different focal lentgh digital zoom level
 3D stabilized 5x lens"
correctiontype c and an action button
Im upgrading from XS My phone is on its last leg Battery is trashed back is cracked and it really lags I should have replaced it last year but I refused to buy another phone with lightning
Because Fast charging damage battery life
Marques Marques This video shouldve been 5 minutes
This might signal my return to Apple from Android No fast charging huh thats kinda odd  But nice offering Yes Marques I just subscribed 
indeed he was serious when he told Tim doesnt mean Im going easy on your new phones though 
Its so hilarious to see people are excited about usbc port in 2023 lol
Marques you were supposed to say good things about it so you can be quoted again
Doesnt seem worth upgrading from my 14 pro max
"Next year they are sneakingly going to increase the price of the base iPhone pro to 1099 for 256GB sighting that it is at the same price for this configuration as last year and thus increasing the base price 
Smart move by apple to make the people accustomed to the new pricing"
They are holding out on fast charging and thunderbolt speeds for next year release you know they much have something new next year as well
Its high time Apple stops feature gating anyone who doesnt want a gigantic phone They also need to start offering Pro Mini phones because theyre too damn large now
That potrait mode later thing is their on Samsung for years
USB 20 on the non pro model is just a slap in the face and they know it Like a little wink for the EU government forcing them to use USBC lol
For a 999 phone base storage should start at 256GB atleast
That amount of price brings heat to my Infinix Hot 30i 
1253 i think the pro for 1199 is a good deal considering most ppl that get the pro max want extra storage 128 gb is too small nowadays for a pro device
The pricing strategy of Apple is so smart that it makes sense to get the 15 Pro Max I dont think 128gb base model of the pro is enough today Would be perfect is the 15 Pro base model starts with 256gb
I got a 12 Pro Max 256guess its upgrade time
Thank you EU for forcing Apple to finally make their everything just one USB type C cable 
Inspired by Chinese Companies 
"You used and reviewed Pixel and Galaxy s23 Ultra It all has it 

Google Photo can take pictures and blur later also 

Galaxy had the action button for a long time 

When it comes to iPhone why does people get excited talk like never seen it before"
Now they have the ability to add fast charging to iPhone 16 or iPhone 17 They do with to justify that this phone is better and they settle where they think that youll accept
Typical apple smh want faster USB speeds Buy the pro 
They robbing us with making only the Pro Max come with 256GB 
iPhone 17 Pro Max will be my camp
We had action button on Samsung since
Does anyone know if cases for 14 Pro would fit 15 Pro with the USB C
Any mention of battery sizes
"Still no fast charging
Ugly thick bezels still there
Ill stick with my android
Next"
Waiting to see what the Pixel 8 has under the heavily leaked hood
Doesnt even show the 5x
great now it shares a same charging port with my 2016 LG phone 
Old design since iphone 11 or 12 no new for apple for higher price no camera zoom 100x  no fingerprint on screen is a badass who will buy it
"Thank God for the EU forcing Apples hand on the USBC

One connector to rule them all"
Im in the camp mini I was wondering if I could try to use the regular sized iPhone pro but it doesnt even have the 5X zoom
You know smartphone tech has reached a plateau in innovation and design when the highlight of the new iPhone is a charging port At this point Apple should take a break and just come out with a new iPhone every 5yrs
Iphone 15 sales are gonna blast through the roof
How to take delicious food videos with iPhone15
"their official promo is the dumbest 
1 why would anyone having a full movie budget shoot with an iphone
2 the gameplay they showed were literally lagging and low quality"
"I understand a logical reason why the base 15 doesnt have USB 30 speeds its using last years chip which never needed that included into the SIP 

Interested to see if the Pro SIPs will trickle down the way to do now or if theyll make separate lines"
New
i still like my google pixel 7 pro
"This COULD be a reason I pick up an iPhone again in the future However I dont think Ill switch until u can easily access photovideo storage from plugging into ur computer not a Mac and not have to use iCloud all the mf time Also I want open software so we can download whatever TF we want on the iPhone not from the appstore AND a half decent file management system 

Once these requirements are met Ill get an iPhone again lol"
Its a let down they did not incorporate a fingerprint sensor they couldve easily added that to the power button and it would be an OMG feature in the Apple world Still what iPhone offers that is unmatched and potentially lifesaving is the GPS messaging options Unless Google offers something similar for the Pixel next month unlikely Im jumping ship to a 15 Pro
Apple should release new iphone now every 2 years and give big upgrades  anyone who has 13 or 14 wont need these upgrades i guess
When reviewing an iPhone the word same gets used a lot 
"Ok the action button is HUGE I loved the S10 series for the Bixby button which you could remap using a 3rd party app to whatever you want Insanely useful to have a flashlight actually available at the press of a button

Samsung doesnt ship a Bixby button on their phones anymore but maybe this launch from apple will bring that kind of thing back  If not switching to iPhone is looking more and more appealing every year"
They only changed to USBC because Europe made it so they cant sell there soon unless they have this port But Apple made it sound like they made this choice So dont give them any credit
How does it compare to the latest Huawei model
Its definitely an iPhone but forced into having usbc thankfully
Really you gonna overlook that it can literally play AAA games now
Love the way those 15s look and Im sure they feel great too Love the feel of that back glass on the pros absolutely hated the shiny steel And I think the slight rounding will make these great to hold I am considering an upgrade but not in a rush
Its really good to see your name at the start of the event   to me the one and only real innovation in that event was that double tap thing in series 9  they should have called it as magic tap
I was looking forward to faster fast charging since they were switching to usb c but they must be saving it until next year to give us a upgrade
Whole apple live event is here
Where is the purple color
Man phones are so boring nowadays I wonder whos gonna get the next exciting mobile device category right first
"I think for the vanilla iphones a rewatch of the iPhone 14 review will suffice 

The pain of making a new video just to describe a USB 20 port and the dynamic island and a processor we already know about is not worth it

A camera performance video would be good though to see how similar it is to the 14 pro"
Do we need a case from your experience holding it I have a tendency to drop it a lot and go to the gym etc
watching MKBHD talk at 12x  of his normal speed is whats new D
13490000 for base 14 pro is 162807 I FUCKING hate them for that
Certainly getting a poor person base 15 with 175 off from TMo for my 8 which goes off iOS support with 17 I thought about it last year but the 14 was a nothingburger Now its time
So the biggest update is something the European Union forced them to do
"So they gave it USBC due to EU laws running at a 23 year old standard and a Bixby button Whats next curved edges with quick access apps The old Galaxy S20 has USB 32 and even the Pro cant catch up to that running at a standard released 15 years ago Whats even the point any more Status Paying more for old tech

I remember when the iPhone was revolutionary now its just Hey heres some cool stuff that may or may not have been made 10 years ago Have fun Oh also we still havent figured out how to reverse the wireless charger sorry 

If it werent for irreparability I dont see why people who prefer the IOS would bother shelling out close to or more than 1000 for a phone thats behind current standards"
I remember that you had once said iphone would never ever replace the mute switch when one plus had removed it 
With the action button update I wonder if they will also finally allow you to set mute onoff with Shortcuts
You are 5 mins behind MrWhostheboss
Still not swapping my 12 mini cant see any new useful features Bring 120hz to base line phone already its 2023
I love how they state all the amazing benefits of USBC I say these existed years ago but now they are forced to use it its all of a sudden awesome still on a 12 Pro and I will wait until next year when they release the iPhone with a user removable battery because that will also be awesomeapparently 
Oh man I was really hoping for USB 10 on the iPhone 15 and USB 20 on the iPhone 15 Pro
your fact is a bit green
They said it in the keynote that the Pro Max gets the new telephoto camera because it has the space to accommodate it
USB C comes thanks to the EU for that
Its crazy how people will be going mad about 5 years old tech in a new box now 
632 Will the official 30W USBC Power Adapter with the 2m USBC Charging Cable increase the fast charging speed on an iPhone 15 Pro vs the 20W USBC Power Adapter  Im not sure what the maximum wattage is for the iPhone 15 Pro
612 They have to keep something to market next models This is the Apple way
"yeahhhh 2000 nits 2 times brighter than the iphone 14

fry my eyesight apple"
Titanium gr5 is lighter and more flexible but not necessarily stronger than steel it depends on the steel alloy
Well its no surprise For years now all of the new functionality is in the software and we just need the hardware to enable those capabilities mostly the system on chip I dont think I ever bought an iPhone for the hardware I always bought it for the software and ecosystem However when you do upgrade after 4 or so years you really notice the bump especially in the camera area
iPhone 15 not getting Action button is classic Apple 
But What apple calls changing focal length has nothing in common with optical focal length Its still the same focal length but a digital crop That matters a lot for photographers as changing focal length also changes the depth of field and the bokeh of the picture Just saying
Why just why Why would they make a usb port their whole thing that made them different was the lightning cable now apple is just trying to be like everybody else
713 shrink just a little bit so you had to buy a new case 
Titanium is not stronger than steel Its stronger per unit of weight but not per volume Meaning steel is about as as strong as titanium depending on the quality it can be stronger significantly stronger in fact but its much heavier
Thank You Marques Insightful
After rocking my 11 Pro Max for close to four years with great battery life  all up until now I thought this was supposed to be the year that I upgrade But after seeing the presentation yesterday I think I might just wait another year
Camp dont care that much
A large reason why aplple is using usbc now is because the eu paard a law saying All mobile phones soled there have to starting 2024
So this guy termed the 35 inch screen on foldable as a small step and here hes raving about a stupid action button
Cheeers Chap good honest review and your disappointment is shared is there going to be an iPhone ultra in the spring I can see that action button getting pressed all the time in bags and you end up with pictures you dont need or mobile data running down if it opens an app Still looks good shame no update to video
Bro has 18 million followers way too much reach for 1 person no way he pays for his phones   EDIT same amount of followers as APPLE
Yay that just means Rob Jos is gonna strike again too LOL Cant wait
If USBC is their biggest headline feature what would have happened if they werent forced to make the switch by EU regulators
Why I change 14 pro max to 15almost same
nice iphone 14 pro max
Apple is just laughing at the consumers and yall are ok with it Just sick
Is it just me or does this video feel sped up Like if you set it to 075x it sounds normal
I love my 13 mini Mini  USBC
Apple is focusing on Vision Pro Someday the iPhone will be discontinued
So the specs list display port on USB C on the pro phones so what is that on an external monitor just screen mirror like the iPad Pro used to do
First time Ill be getting a Pro model Hated the weight and the shiny stainless steelThe Titanium does it for me
AND youve got a GFX 100 2 unit  1107
USB C in iPhone  What a new invention by apple
I really want to get a  new iPhone as my 12 Mini is slowly getting old But none of the new features make me go I need to have that My wife just got a Pixel 7a and considering the price thats a really cool phone Im just really locked into Apples ecosystem and dont really want to switch to Android Too bad the Mini isnt around anymore
12x  35mm equivalent So ya pretty popular focal length
Is the iPhone 15 going to suffer with the same battery life issues as the 14pro seeing as it has the same SoC
"I personally think If you are using an IPhone 14 pro maxdont get fomo
"
Camp Dont care at all Rocking my SE 2016 to this day 
What happened to the Pro Max  I dont see it on the website
"Im trying not to be biased but I am wondering whether or not this feels disappointing because it seems like another incremental upgrade chip performance is slightly better than prior upgrades most impressive when my expectations were for a more drastic change similar to the iPhone X

OR

Did apple do this because they know that a lot of people have been holding out for this iPhone 15 and therefor they dont really need to make a complete revamp because the iPhone renewal cycle will have a ton of demand anyways so people will just buy it anyways Then maybe next year they do something special

Just a thought I have a 14 pro max and I dont really feel like it is worth the upgrade for my everyday use"
In India the 15 pro max cost whopping 1900 USD 
usb20marquesup
I liked you video cause it good content and informative not cause I like the phone
Call me crazy but I think a lot of android user will buy this phone just because of the USBC charging port
now the 15 gets 48mp camera theres no need for me to get the pro  I got the pro before because the 13 14 cameras where meh  looks like I will be getting 15 plus this year  colour choices are awful though I hate the pastel washed out colours
Waiting for iPhone 16 for the fingerprint reader feature then Ill switch to it
Im using a 12 pro max and still got 82 percent on battery But I guess it is time to get into 15 pro line up
So basically they were forced to finally use USBC then they dumbed it down just to be spiteful Unless you buy an Apple  certified product cable that will sell for 60 more Im assuming
can someone explain to me why the world needs an ultra 2 watch even with how stacked the specs on the first ultra is
All the apple users I talked to said they think usb c is nice but they dont really care I think the only thing that matters is actually that iOS works as they used to and the price
And actually they could have gone a bit further with the action button by enabling its configuration depending if you press it once twice or hold it for example maybe next year
That action button animation seems really oddly intrusive and doesnt fit with the rest of the UI
Does the base 15 get a higher refresh rate screen
waiting for the review
still not M1 chip dayumn
Is the iPhone 15 coming with a 90 Hertz display
Not impressed I rly dont think Apple would be in my future plan
i think for the first time im interested
Why do you want to charge everything with 1 cable
Ive been holding out on buying a new phone I currently use iphone7 cuz I wanted fingerprint recognition But I guess its time to give up and just get a new phone
The phone is boring as fuck but Ill watch to support Marques and the team
sooooooo he missed the part in the presentation that they mentioned that u can record video directly to wired external memory
So is the standard model still 60hz
Boring phone of the year 2023
please stop seeing holy grail in nothing  Apple this year Sucks sorry youtubers be brave and say it It wont take away your ticket to Apple Park next year
Not worth upgrade to iPhone 15 am happy with iPhone 11
Get fast charging at only 299charge day Get monthly charging allowance at only 5999
Samsung z fold 5 is interesting phone this year
This guys so jaded now
Apple Ripping us off as always
With the charging I think that its optimized to prolong the battery Faster charging  more heat and battery wear
I think if Apple went all out on USBC it would kinda be highlighting how much it can do with transfer speeds etc By phasing in the full USBC potential slowly Apple can take full ownership of the improvements Clever IMO
Nice but I dont understand all these romantic feelings around iPhone I mean to me it is still the same phone just twisting everything I dont understand the obsession around all these phones It is still the same phone nothing much I wont take all these phone manufacturers seriously until they give us something never seen in this generation Phone shouldnt be all about chips camera and design come on they gave us iPhone 14 then remove some features and then added some new ones and now iPhone 15 doing the same thing
They will never changed the iPhone
The only reason I would maybe get the pro is the Vision video recording feature
So simply put  phone is now a camera but still carries the feature of a telephone Well it clearly indicates saturation in tech used in phones now Upgrades are basically a bigger screen and better camera year on year Hmm
Gonna be waiting for next years iphone 16 to replace my iphone 6s 
The A17 is a huuuge disappointment 10 faster and no battery improvement at all This 3 Nanometer is a joke
Action button should have had options for quick press long press double press triple press etc It should always have a mute option AND other other options Not this OR this
Totally gonna get one Just need to figure out what organ Im gonna have to sell Hmmm
009 Whats this look 
I like how Apple have turned something they were forced into by the EU into their main selling point
Theres thunderbolt 5 with 120 Gbit one way They didnt do that on the max
I really dont like that new button since if you change its action you wont be able to switch the ring offon And I can already see that it will sometimes activate in your pocket if they are tight enough They should have kept the same old button but add the new one on the other side 
How about Google assistant shortcut assigned to action button  
can you do Huawei mate 60 impression thank u
MKBHD asked for fast charging and now its here Ultra charging Tim Cook 2024 Apple event
so mini7 will get a17 non pro
59 mins ago
So the pro iPhone supports external ssds with mac formatted apfs
The pink color is perfect that alone is enough for me to want to upgrade from my 12 mini 
I am sure that Apple would be doing the best of best of iPhone as always  but it is not something innovative Digital Zoom itself is a gimmick and Apple introducing it as 2X zoom 30 years later it was first inttttroduced on cameras is more gimmicck I really dont understand if the people are getting dumber or iPhones smarter 
i Love you
In general its not much but given that I only switch iPhones at odd numbered versions it makes sense for me to upgrade and enjoy a USB C iPhone
Most used word I heard through same same same same Sounds like nothing really changed from one year to the next only aesthetics have slightly changed
500K within the hour 
When you mention the 15 is the more or less the last years pro phone I guess you miss the one thing that lots of people care about refresh rate Its an eye watering 60hz display
Still iconic 60HZ
not worth upgrade from 14 pro to 15 pro
"If anyone have noticed or not 
On each iphone review video samsung ad is coming
Same with all other youtubers
Lol "
They shouldve call it the iPhone 14S
cant be happier with the USBC  Tomorrow is trash day and I just placed 9 Lightning cables in my trash  saved one since I still need it for my current 14PM    When I get my 15PM and tradein my 14PM Ill finally be free of the dreaded Lightning cables forever
apple think different  which means you can launch a new product with 0 new things lol
Poor iPhone users endured the slow USB 2 speed for 2 decades
Why with an old chip 
These new iPhones truly are the best iPhones Apple has ever made
Anyone know the wallpaper
I was looking at the comparisons on the Apple website from 11 till now Yes its a different build and so on But the changes are still quite small The 11 Pro has served me well Shame about the 5x only being on the max thats what might hold me back
wait back up you said only the Pro model phones have the action button
I think might finally upgrade from my iPhone XR I guess its time
WonderFool Event
Im actually thinking of buying the 15 for 799 instead of a used 13 pro for the same price Thoughts
So iphone is still trying to catch up with Samsung 
I had to double look when they quoted you on stage well deserved  bet it felt great
I really wanted to see Marquesss face when they said that the iPhone now comes in USBC and that it was integrated into their Apple products for years
I dont really know who to ask so Ill just ask you guys Im on android and Im planning to switch to iPhone would it better to get the iPhone 14 pro or the base iphone 15
60hz phone for 800 in 2023 but we got USB c yoohooo
I thought it was disappointing Looks like hardly anything changes from year to year now with these phones
"Its an iPhone



With a camera"
"So thats it 
Next iphone 16 pls"
Very minor updates Wont be getting an iphone 15
S24 ultra will destroy  iphone 15 series
"Going to be brutal here I slept on it and Ive watched the review to see if I felt different

But no Its time to move on from the iPhone Maybe next year Apple But today Im ordering an Galaxy Z Fold 5"
The most exciting feature in these phones was the EUs idea and apple havent even implemented it properly
Yeah USBC is welcome on iPhone Except that USBC is a big mess The one cable thing is true only on paper
Absolutely getting the 15 pro Seems like a decent upgrade from my 11 pro
"MKBHD ironically Apple in September 12 2012 changed to lightning and they said in the keynote thats for the next decade 

2022 was completion of the decade 
"
Same o same o iphoneSAMSUNGANDROID FOR LIFE
Congratulations to all apple addicts to have simple affordable and easy to get cable to charge your apple gadgets from a friends power bank who got only type c D D
"Apple listens to you Marques
I just need to say it"
Since iOS 17 is inside these phones you can do a presentation on the final iOS 17
"Apple finally switch to Type C
Apple Its only USB 20 same stuff from 20 years ago 
Year 2050 Apple We finally have USB C 32 speed
Apple fans They invented this stuff Take my kidney"
Before the event I was leaning towards upgrading my iPhone 14 Pro to a iPhone 15 Pro but after the event I am leaning to not upgrading It was the fact no improved cameras battery life is not mentioned except to say all day battery life I really wanted to see if they would have reverse wireless charging and it was not to be I wanted something like being able to charge my Apple Watch but I might think about it if I could use the usbc to charge my watch  Really does not impress me so I will just wait and stop in at my cell service provider when they have the pro models that can be seen felt and touched
Most underwhelming iPhone launch Il stick with the 13pro for another year
So nothing special or different Again
Apple even mentioned you MKBHD at the beginning  Did anyone noticed 
I have so many usbc things just having my phone take it as well is such a welcomed feeling
Titanium selling point is a gimmick Apple knows 98 of people will use a case and never see this during everyday use
That action button on the side of the phone has been replaced with long press power button on Galaxy Much better and cleaner
Pro line is literally definition of gatekeeping 
Soomy 13pro max is ok still Wait for next year youre saying
20w is embarrassing And the action button is just the bixby button all over again
About the charging The pixel still only does have really fast charging it 18W ish So they are not the only one that doesnt have true fast charging
No fast refresh rate 
Pathetic event We use titanium and usb c now we innovate  Thats a 3 trillion dollar company out there
I dont care at all All this hustle because Apple switched to USB Type C charging cable I guess Apples 2030 vision is to add a fast charging  I have switched from iPhone to Android a couple years ago and I would never think of having one again  1200 for what What a joke 
omg these are all just features android has had for years now its kinda boring
I think the colors were better last year
Ram size
I am really happy EUROPE made them do this 
im waitin for the next green pro model 11 and 14 had it maybe 17 will too
Apple is like first make a problem and then solve it only upgrade is type c and people are making fuzz
Welcome to 2015 iPhone users 
"This is an iphone 14 with a usb C  dont beleive the apple bots in the comments  
If you dont have an iphone buy 15 
If you have 1213 or 14 pro max 
Dont upgrade"
Wooooooooh you have a superdupermega quote and unquote mentioned 
plz explain what s going on with lightning or usb cthunderboltnot really clear here
This is a big upgrade from the last years iPhone
So in summary Apple are so far behind the competition now its kinda sad
I might be the only person who isnt worried about fast charging on the new usbc My battery lasts me all day typically with 93 max battery capacity and I charge overnight via smart wireless charger to avoid overcharging Im a little worried about bumping that action button at the worst possible times though
I wonder what would apple do without the new EU regulations regarding usb c They surely would stay with lightning so the new iphone would have 0 new features
Arent snt the last gen pro models better than this years
Anyone who watched to the end is definitely in the Care region
Wait I thought the entire iPad line up was already USB C
Thats a 2000 USD a night hotel room
I was watching this video and samsung z fold 5 ad just popped up lol
When will apple come out with a foldable iPhone  The same design is getting old and boring
Wow USB type C groundbreaking apple strikes again
Im glad they brought the blue back It looks like a slightly different version of the Pacific Blue that my 12 Pro Max is Once reason I didnt want to go to the 14 I like the blue So now I may consider the 15 since it has the blue now
The new usbc i feel apple mocking their users right now 
yo just hear me out is there anybody who watch this video and see marquez hairs seems so sharp that its white just sayin i mean its so crisp lookin on myy screen
Upgrading coming from a Xr
Not worth an upgrade If you can hold onto your current device for another 3 years You will thank me later
Whaaat
Keeping this all aside the cinematography of this Apple event is  especially the connectivity part clip where one person is standing in crowded market and the transaction to the road in that and ofcourse apple is there satire is 
The only thing that blew me off the chair was ray tracing on iPhone Makes me wonder what the M3 chip will be capable of 
Apple is so brave
"It is not a PHONE

It is a flipping super computer
So call it a mobile"
Still no 120hz on the base model 
Great phone but just a waste of money same every year
"No headphone jack though
F Apple"
Looks heavy
He was staying in the same hotel last time
There is no any new features all what Apple ID doing just improving the camera thats all
its getting less and less exciting every year
They are not putting effort in surprising people anymore
Apple used to be about Seamless Not u need both Lightning and USB C  thanks to their great Vision 
So Apple really only talked about the cameras neat software tricks and materials Not a single chart or graph about processor speeds or whatever Interesting to see the quiet infiltration of true scifi cyberpunk future stuff like double tap satellite stuff 3D video
Im still using redmi 5 from 6 years ago
Samsung has added a portrait feature in S  Note and foldflip series for a long time
Spatial Video on iPhone is mind blowing
I keep telling everyone its pointless because its not gonna have fast charging and this is coming from a guy who has both android and iPhone I get the best of both worlds
Apple put USBC in the new iPhone because the EU law not being ecofriendly etc but its inexplicably limited to 23yearold USB 20 speeds
"Again no new innovation missing Steve jobs 
Happy with my S23ultra"
Been using the 13 for the last 2 years dont see a solid reason to switch
never been an apple guy just some rummors in my mind saing that I should try an iphone some day the new tipec is a good step but it still looks like a huge price for  what it is
Wow A phone Zzzzzzzzz
Just a liitle info Apple was forced to use usb3 as the EU banned the old ports dont let them sell it to you as a feature as they were forced to add it
I just hate how they headline the USB C to be their main change but they leave out on so many features they could put in the phone just so they have areas of improvement for future phones its the same thing that NVIDIA did when Etherium was cut off The 40 series cards magically became 60 better than previous there had to be a reason to buy so dumb how we are in a choke hold
"Im curious why you released this video so late Is there data supporting late night releases like this Or did you just happen to get it done at this time
Just interested because Im thinking of getting into making videos and always thought a release of like 7am would be optimal
Always love your videos thanks "
Half a million views in 1 hour
I broke my main camera in my iPhone 11 and have been waiting but holding off an upgrade since might be convinced by the USB C supremacy But its sucks that the only major upgrades Id care about the cameras and the usb port speeds are exclusive to to the most expensive model The base 15 is just not hugely interesting
Im only getting the phone to play re4 on the go
"For those who werent there During the event every youtuberinfluencer was taking pictures and videos with Marques including myself Even when he was shooting his hands on video He took his time for every single person who came up to him Respect As I said to him
thank you for your videos"
cheapest ipad was already with usbc just phones were lagging behind
I am seriously confused between 14 pro max and 15pm
Im glad there is no price increase
man those baseline phone are so fucking basic at 800 lmao
"Im in camp Ive been waiting for USBc for several years now  

I look forward to getting a iPhone 15 I just dont know which of the 4 models is best for me just yet  Ill wait to see the reviews before purchasing"
Thinking about to switch from S21 Ultra 15 pro max or S23 Ultra Maybe something else
USB c on iPhone will be great Im a big fan of GoPro and the usb c transfer of photos and videos to iPad is great
Will wait for Flossy review
"It takes a legendary reviewer to be included in an Apples introduction event in a section thats supposed to represent what people think of Apples products at least from Apples perspective which Marques totally was

Congratulations to Marques for being featured in one of Apples most major events"
Yall can thank our folks from Europe for this change
Its not just an update Its the same design 99 yes but it is a tottaly different phone on the inside
MKBHDs name being dropped in the event is hilarious
not gonna upgrading this year
Apple starting the event with MKBHD review quotes 
15 pro costs 1300 dollars in ireland
I am using my 6 years old iphone XR and new iphones still do not giggle me enough to switch Am I getting old or the iphones are just getting boring
The baseline iPad technically does have USBC
my first iPhone is going to be the iPhone 15pro kinda scared to make the shift but the USB C is making it a bit easier
Tell me you can make a glasshalfempty review without telling me you can make a glasshalfempty review 
Said heres a lens to see through  shows the lenses of the iPhone ofc its MKBHD
I believe only apple certified cable can charge iphone with fast wattage speed
Not impressed nothing new
iPhone 15 is such quite a leap from previous gen and i think this will affect the 12 and 13 prices just like the 12 did to 11
mkbhd at this time stamp 012 you said iPhone 15 the 23rd iPhone can you explain Like give me the list proving its 23rd iPhone and according to my research its 35th iPhone 
Wow anker sponsor any sane person would stay away from that company now But you gotta pay for the robot arm somehow i guess LMAO
Ive always had an iPhone  but its getting so old  every year  whatever camera upgrade  minor changes and upgrades  minor visual change  some colors  thaaatsss ittt If taken care of  they last years and continuously get updated Pointless to upgrade  maybe and I mean maybe every 23 years 
Kudos to Mkbhd to make  about 15 mins video even though everybody knew nothing much to say much about new 15 series
Feels like not much of an upgrade from my 13pro still Meh may think of upgrading once iphone 16 is here
pricing in india is absurd
The new thing iPhone 15 comes with is USBC
"I  Anker Im using Anker 20w Nano lll for my 14pro My 14pro never gets hot while charging My 14pro is 8 months old and the battery health is still 100 
"
Please compare with latest Huawei phone ty
The titanium really has me intrigued I would really like to know just how much titanium theyre using They didnt raise the prices yet titanium is a considerably more expensive material than steel So theyve either taken the loss out of their margins or theyve cut costs somewhere else maybe by not implementing the actual benefits of USBC That or they really arent using much titanium Ive had titanium watches and they feel interesting Due to the low thermal conductivity and low weight titanium can almost sometimes feel like plastic
Getting it
I wanted a new design its 20234 same boaring shape and the ultra 2 no new sensors or solar charger 
Im a new comer in the US  my mom in china mainland wants to change a new iPhone  so that we can make FaceTime I recommend her to buy iPhone 14 after the iPhone 15 issue itll be a big sale after iPhone 15 china government is banning apple products now  it doesnt allow central government officer to use any apple products when they are woking thats so crazy 
Whats your view on ESIM only Out of the US you can get with nano tray and eSIM Not all countries provide eSIM capabilities makes travel a little tricky
Is there any REAL difference between iPhone 13 14 and 15 apart from this is the fastest iPhone ever repeated in launch Looks like Apple wants the other kidney 2
I think the biggest improvement is the regular 1515 since they got the big camera sensor upgrade
"Looking forward to Apple quoting MKBHD during next product launch with
This probably wont make a real difference to most people its kind of a bummer"
Whats up with the stacked sensor
Im almost entirely in the buy camp to upgrade from my standard iPhone 12 to the 15 Pro Max
Ok itll be the Pixel 8 Pro for me as planned
wait for selfexchangablebattery iphone 16
This guy when it comes to iphone he will say it is  okay for the price Lol
"I really disappointed for such minor upgrades 
We all expected huge leap difference when it cane to A17 chip and why they choose to call it pro with only 10 improvements

Also screen no change  
Battery no change  
No fast charging  
Why should I upgrade from Iphone 14 pro max  
I started getting bored "
Have any Supersaf selfies to show us
"Apple needs to make a new line of phones Keep the iPhone for the mass markets and then they need a new cutting edge phone where they try on all the new tech and take risks

As a business apple cant try risky things with their iPhone  Its their everything  But they need something new and fresh"
This is Peak iPhone now I mean the improvements each year as so small that you could probably now wait three years between upgrading your iPhone To be fair I guess same can be said about Android flagships Sure there will be plenty of people keeping up with the joneses though 
So no better battery life 
"I really hate this USB C stuff Not because I preferred lightning or anything weird I like the new charging speeds for the pro models Definitely But I hear so often that now you only need one cable to charge all of your devices and thats just BS to me I carry my MacBook my iPhone my AirPods Max and an external SSD at a minimum with me most places that Im traveling with my tech bag And in almost every scenario Im using at least 2 devices at the same time and therefore will need to charge both items over night usually Im NOT taking one cable with me Im typically taking my MagSafe charger for the MacBook my iPhone cable and the USBC chord for the SSD And a single if I have any usb A accessories because those still exist 

So much hype around USB C and Im not really sure for what beyond data transfer speeds Im not sure most people actually wouldve cared if Apple kept lightning but made it faster All my current devices are lightning like the MagSafe charger the AirPods Pro the AirPods Max and Im supposed to upgrade just for a stupid charger port upgrade Pass 

Again Ive got nothing against USB C and welcome it I just think the hype surrounding it is stupid It could be literally any other cable thats faster and people probably wouldnt care If youre getting away with 1 cable everyday everywhere you go kudos to you My tech bag needs more than that By upgrading to the 15 pro max also means that my lightning cables will eventually just be garbage I typically keep 23 chargers at home 1 in the car and 1 at work"
im only buying iPhone once it offers a portable Refrigerator
Damn nearly half a million views in less than an hour
The thing about the USB controller is its a host bus controller They mentioned storage devices in the keynote Record directly to thumb drive effectively Or what Im going to do plug it into my monitor at home and see what happens
"Honestly quite disappointed The 15 starting price in Europe at 949 is insane in my opinion 1000 phone with slower USB C no AOD no 120Hz no reversed wireless charging no action button I dont care too much about the camera As long as I can scan documents or take basic quality pictures Im happy
I am probably going to stick with my XS or switch to something more affordable with USB C like a Pixel as soon as their smartwatches get better and my current phone broke "
Surely the next gen portrait mode will also be available on the 14 pro
Tim Cook quoting you was a beautiful moment Congrats Marques and MKBHD crew
Im in camp Sssssso thatsall
All i care about is getting usbc apple earbuds will they do it probably not But ive used lightning apple buds for like 5 years and before that used headphone jack ones for like 5 years Hoping they just give us a usbc version too
Waiting for the camera review but as mostly Android user I see apple finally getting or rather giving features I can seriously consider switching So maybe for now bye Samsung bye OnePlusbye Zenphone
Heres a lens to look at all this stuff through classic stuff
Not worth it Simple and to the pointSaved you 1329 minsec of your life
Amazing The only innovation is an USB C port for over thousand bucks That is how you rip off your customers
LOL 215 friends 80 of Apple user use an Android device for ther regular need 641  821 nice but the are very cleaver  Like you
Ladies and gentlemen this video was made by the New Xiaomi camera
"Apple have really missed an opportunity on this forced USBC change Keeping the 15 at USB 2 speeds and the lack of fast charging is just ridiculous They had a chance to bring their phones into the modern era but it seems theyre still just bitter about being forced to switch My S22 Ultra battery may drain faster than my wifes iPhone 11 but it charges back to full in less than half the time

The more replaceable parts is also a forced move to repairability not something theyre doing out of the kindness of their hearts

I must admit though the portrait data in regular photo mode intrigued me as a Samsung user

Seems my wife will still just get the 13 theres nothing exciting about the 15 to make it worth the price uplift"
The iPhone we sell more because of the dynamic island 
No innovation wait usb c Lol
I think that iPhone not making fast charger because of battery loss and making your battery life better
I got a samsung ad before this video
If Apple releases a new iPhone but MKBHD hasnt posted about it does it even exist
"Apple in 2023

We are introducing the next big revolutionary change

Usb type C on iphone"
Fast charging is a next year invention
"Lightning is dead I didnt even know about new AirPods cases
And now remains the Magic Mouse x"
The pink wallpaper is so bad it looks gross
Kinda surprised that the processor isnt talk about more I guess we have to wait for the full review to know its capabilities and efficiency since its a 3nm process node
"15 is worth to buy better than 14 from last year i mean the 48mp camera the usb c stuff the dynamic island thing yeah they use old chipset but a16 still over power until right now especially to playing some lightgame and maybe ppl choose this as value for long term use so they can keep updating to the newest operation system 

than buying product from 1 or 2 years before"
Stop with the Anker sponsorships not a good company
Its good that they went type c route now the world is one step closer to universal charging cable As far as upgrade go nah I rather replace iPhone 13 battery for under 100 bucks once it reach 85 percent battery health that way I can use it for another 2 to 3 years and I use wireless charging everything so all  this isnt a selling point for me personally
Pink iPhone is gonna do bits
Apple had slow Lightning some how
"y l m c ca ti

This is my dream"
Do we know how youll be able to silence the phone if youre using the action button for something else
If I had a dollar for every time an iphone reviewer says same
Does the USBC port supports display out on all models Will it switch to stage manager or only mirror the screen device
Imagine having an iPhone
Excited for this Im Android for life and loving my S23 but never had an iPhone This will be my first iPhone Im getting the pro btw need that new chip That pro max isnt justified at all lol
"Limited usb speeds on the 15 and 15 is pathetic 

Just because they didnt add a usb controller onto the chipset lol"
Basically is just USBC
Apple should now release their phones by alternative year rather than every year Doesnt make sense if no major changes happening
Me watching from my 7plus 
Meh they can do better
Looking forward to the new pixel 8 iPhone is the same for years is just hype
Like the video the phones are meh
Imagine buying the same thing every year and thinking its an upgrade
"Im in the dont care camp Bought Nothing Phone 2 so Im happy with that But seriously managing to not give fast charging or to bump the base versions to USB 3 is sad 

I do think Apple is headed in the right direction though and for those who are entrenched in the apple eco system this is especially a good upgrade"
Some uuuugly ass colors on the 15s Pros are okay but why theyre doubling down on the iMac colors is bafflings
Wish they made the pink for the pro
Come on
iPhones are getting boring 
This is so sad its a poor mans phone
bixby button is back
I think its better to wait for at least 3 months to monitor its performance  get legit views before upgrading
Hate usb c Breaks so fast
I was looking forward to 15pro to replace my 13pro but now I am disapointed with camera system not being same as on 15 pro max I might go with pro max but I am worried about size I would rather have smaller size phone This is my only complaint to Apple
I know android users cant say shi anymore rather than to cry
Thank you  for the first look Ill stick with the iPhone 14 Pro Max 
Dont really care about cables in magsafe world Can you talk about the 3d video capture to watch it on vision pro That is the biggest feature in my opinion especially if VR AR takes off
So basically 95 of these features are a software update for the 14 pro max but you have to buy the new one
My 8 is still working but its running out of space  Im wondering if I should get the 15 Hmmm
The same story every year Bummer that 15 and 15 plus still has 60 hz
"fast charging is saved for iPhone 20
Apple meeting notes"
Those two buckets contain just about everything in the iPhone for the past 8 years
MKBHD gonna bind google assist to the action button lol
Even when apple gave us usb c they still chose to not give us entirity of its capabilities Classic apple gatekeeping at its finest
I love watching stuff I cant afford  
"You know what is disappointing Apple
Never bought any Apple products"
Usbc but no fast charging Lmao yall apple fans stay getting fleeced
Im gonna like this video because I think youre the coolest Techguy on YT but basically I dont care about the new Iphones no Have a great day Mr Brownlee 
"It was awesome to see Apple use a quote from your video during their segment on the 15 MacBooks You know youve done well for yourself when a trillion dollar company respects your opinion that much

Ive never been so proud of someone Ive never met"
Samsung makes the same phone with some updates EVERYONE RIOTS Apple releases the same phone with some minor updates EVERYONE LOSES THEIR MINDS The hypocrisy is next level
Absolutely nothing is the answer to ur first question
Flips open foldable android new buttoncloses
Just heads up make Shure to research quick charge pro it charge fast 15 minute till full its cost around 30 buck thank me later goes for everybody whos ever see this and your welcome
Im rocking and SE 2nd Gen so its time to upgrade 15 Pro Max 
You need to give me more than that apple
Im in camp I wanna choose my own focal lengths like I want a wide a normal and a 2x You can add a 5x to that if you want but like 3x is too close and normal is too far So Im stuck with an old phone
Same designagain
I thought I would be all in I charge  my Mac book on usbc
Im in the camp of where tf is the Mini series or Gen 4 SE
We need to be more critical towards Apple We allow them to get a pass with alot of things we wouldnt allow other companies to do
They didnt give it Thunderbolt and fast charging so they have selling points for iPhone 16 Pro
Im so annoyed I purchased the 14plus then they release 15plus with dynamic island USBC port and altered the camera 
Not a feature a lot of people will care about but as a youtuber the ability to record directly to an external hard drive is pretty nice Especially since those 4k video files are a pain to transfer otherwise
Since i have the Z Fold 5 all this is pretty laughable Nevertheless I like that action button on the pros I might consider buyin no of course lol Oh important notice Ive used iPhones for a decade and havent all of a sudden turned into an antiApple person but the foldable concept really excites me and suits my use too So when does Apple do that  
Apple will consider 45w as fast charging on 2030 by which time android phones will probably be at 600w charging speeds by then  with 5 minutes or less charging time for 6000mAh batteries and apple will claim they released the 45w as proprietary at apple discovered speed 
"Ive been using iPhone since iPhone 4 To be honest IPhone 15 was the biggest let down yet 

When USBC is a headline you know Apple has lost the plot"
I could understand the default to 15x 35mm because its the best focal length
So booring
what colour should i get guys i really dont know
2 hours to charge your phone in 2023 Absolutely embarrassing
Fast charging in iphone 16 You need at least something to tempt apple sheeps to upgrade every year
PURE VICTORY USB C FOR THE WIN
I was hoping this generation would be the one to make me switch from Android but to see theyve not innovated at all is disappointing
Rip lightning shout out to his family
Is 15 pro max worth the upgrade from a 13 pro max
Does the nonpro models still have 60hz display
Can the AirPods case charge the iPhone
POG the same phone a year later POG
USBC is great  all but no Fast Charging is a bummer Not really worth upgrading from last years model
I am not interested Satisfied with my 14 Pro Max 
Nice review I just want to say its just the same iPhone as always Only with a little update Omg  iPhone  cash in
 same damn phone new upgrade for twice the price
As someone that lives in Europe hearing the American prices hurts me The pro model starts from 1411USD here in Denmark 
Curious to know the exact figures of their Battery capacities
23rd iPhone 
Imagine having 2300 comments 45 minutes from publishing a video Thats how you know you made it
Coming from a 11 pro Ill definitely upgrade this time to the pro max but i cannot decided which color natural and blue being my fav
Fast charge will come next year Iphone 16 Milking u more hahaha
Sly guy love the vids and USBC is the future But Im still paying off this iPhone 14 Pro Lol
Bruh the action button UI in the options are just smoootttthhhhh and neat
Im just waiting for the iPhone SE man 
As a proud Samsung owner I watch these videos just to scoff at the sheep Steve Jobs must be turning in his grave knowing literally everything new on the iPhone is literally YEARS old tech copied from androidminus the good stuff like fast charging 
Apples Climate Initiatives are by far the most impressive announcement at the event It makes the Apple watch at carbon neutral the biggest innovation in tech this Year
so usb c with usb b speeds for normal iphones the way apple does things and everyone just starving to eat right out their hands year after year is so crazy to me
Curious if the rode mic USBC works right away OR the Flir Thermal Camera
"Can Marques please stop promoting fast charging Its bad for longevity bad for the user and bad for the planet
Cheap chinese companies might not care about any of those but proper engineers do I hope Apple holds firm against those brainless selfdamaging demands"
Ill an orange kinda guy 
Does it overheat just as fast too
Dont they look thinner than the previous models
Will USB C be more reliable than lightning for data transfers for just the iPhone 15
Apple runs on a cycle of 4 every 4 iPhones a big change happens to the looks of the phone this is because they like to keep the same manufacturing process that is also why they reuse old parts like the body for SE iPhones beginning with the iPhone 6 significantly different build to the 5 4 iPhones lates they announce the iPhone X 4 iPhones later the iPhone 14 with that major design change of the island  next big change will be iPhone 18
When the Galaxy S8 2017 got a bixby button which could be set as an action button for shortcuts and functionalities plus the power button that could launch the camera by double pressing it people hated it Now people are so excited about it The innovators often get the hate the followers get the love 
Reviewers be complaining if a 300 android doesnt have an amoled 120hrz display along with fast charging but hardly complain about 60hrz and slow charging on an 800 iphone All have failed us consumers had they been hard on apple for 60hrz on iphone 13 just like pixel 6a we would have got a 90hrz iphone 15
The future z fold 6 ultra and the  s23 ultra 1tb that I have  iPhone 15 pro max
is it possile to connect type c pendrives to share files
my own opinion but very bland presentation Nothing new Just same phone a little bit better
Will be interesting to see if USBC will also enable stuff like USB Video Class support on iPhones like it does on iPads with iPadOS 17
Once again Apple playing it safe and not thinking outside the box Android is way more innovative and risk taker
Come on I cant be the only one disappointed here
I have a galaxy z fold 3 Should i go for iphone 15 pro max or wait for the s24 ultraexynos
Honestly iPhones dont excite me anymore than a pack of potato chips do If it were not for the iOS ecosystem Id have switched to Android with their cool hardware
Not sure about Nothing but apple did made tech fun again with iPhone 15pro
I tend to leave my phone in silent mode 99 of the time which means the mute switch hardly ever gets used Changing it to an action button cleverly adds utility to an otherwise seldom used button for me anyway
Ive had the xs for a while I think its time for an upgrade
I like the change I hate when Im at work and my andriod phone is dead and I go around asking everyone for a charger and everyone has an iPhone
What else Apple can come up with of course camera which hardly anyone use unless professional photographer for whom this set is not enough for serious work titanium body that nobody asked unless you going to use iPhone to play with dog because you forgot frisbee at home Its  amazing  how little innovation means for Apple this days Money money money Apples direction
Is it me or is the L and R soundtrack on this out of sync Feel weird
"Bro he is trying
TRYINGGG
I love marques"
"Welcome to 
Things that we cant afford"
Disappointed from Apple No innovation
RIP Lightning
67 size still has the same name as the bedroom toy
I promise nobody cares about phones anymore
Im still using an original iPhone SE model A1723im not bothered by all the new iPhones
Does this mean looking for those overpriced MFI certified cables is a no more for the 15s
Wow 30 minutes into video release and already 1700 comments And all just because of usbc becoming mandatory by law EU and for which reason iPhone is forced to introduce it
It looks pretty nice Ive been using android since i switched from the 4S My Flip 3 just broke so i might get this one
The strange x Zoom settings are to match 24 35 and 50 mm equivalence
Its ridiculous that USBC could be a big deal in 2023
Smartphones are reaching their peak
The apple event was boring as expected But I recognize your hotel
Iphone total trash why worth upgrade from 14 pro same camera just zoom why color apple you kiding
Funny how these reviewer write a soft worded review for iphones even when they dont have any new features but if it is Samsung they really rip em up
Wait Is that true Theres no iPhone in existence without fast charging WTF I use my Android phone all day and the wireless fast chargers I have scattered around my life get me through the day
Maybe with USBC i might finally care
You look disappointed
and still in 2023 iphone still ca not get rid of their feature with 60hz refresh screen while others its a norm to have higher refresh screen great feature apple indeed
Im watching this on my iphone 7 
Basically its a iPhone 14 pro with type C 
It getting boring now nothing is new aside the chip and usbc Who cares about about the 48MP 5X has been on Android for years
Still no fast charging still Notch and same design are you not bored yet
Sounds like a compliance update to make sure Iphone can still be sold in EU 
"Well have to see how it performs in terms of resistance They have been pretty good for a while now but the steel and the rounded corners should make a slight difference Sometimes the glass breaks out of the pressure from a dented corner I am curious as to whether the rounded corners are better or worse on impact The fact its lighter will also help with the impact as the energy released when it reaches the ground will be smaller What Im not sure will help is the smaller indent of the screen but if it glass all the way to the edge it may be exactly the same 
What made a difference was the ceramic glass That is really tough"
Apple lovers going to flip when apple invents inscreen fingerprints multiuser support reverse wireless charging split screen It will be neverbeforeseen innovation by Apple
Apples now putting used chips in their new phones
Tim Cook mentioning your name at the keynote just cemented you as the GOAT of tech
Nice to see the Pros got a price cut in the UK
Do you know if 4k30 ProRes is available on the iPhone 15 pro 128gb
300k plus views in 48 mins holaayyyy
They showed the 1x 12x 15x off pretty in depth in the keynote 
I guess they will save the fast charging feature for future iphone models 
New ophone 
I dont like the USB C and I dont like the toggle switch change so I dont think Ill be changing unless it really really catches my eye in person but honestly I miss my 13 pro max kinda wanna go back to that
Iphone just invented the USB C  quick samsung and androids switch to usb c or be left behind in dustbin  of history Apple innovation
What will it take for Apple to give theses iPhones  a 5x6 app grid  like on Androids
"I was interested in the pro max but after the event Im leaning just towards the standard 67 model 

I didnt really hear much about the pro max and improved video stability or the telephoto lens Unless I missed it 

Biggest thing I want is usb c and they all have that  Am I missing something else I overlooked during the speech to push the max pro   Specially if the reg has a telephoto camera already even if 2x and not 3x"
Finally iPhone users now  gain the ability to leave the charger at home and not feel a sudden panic
Thanks u MKBHD
you know marques is bought by apple when he understates the importance of fast charge that is unacceptable for a phone in 2023
Apple is hype
"If the iPhone 15 pro has 7 focal length equivalent in 1 phone
The S23 ultra ought to have 15 lenses but they dont go around flexing do they
Atleast you actually get 4 cameras including 1 that moves  in the back of that phone instead 3 claiming to be 7"
From US THANK YOU EUROPEAN UNION for forcing USB 3 on Apple   So glad Apple lost the lawsuit
Prolly they use A17 PRO  because for next year iphone 16 they gonna have A17  and they claimed it as iphone 16 now is powered by our new chip that ever fitted on any of our iphones lineup
I wish we could still have the mini
This review determines whether I buy the phone or not
"I loved the new iphones but Apple really needs to step up their game with the non pro models 
Not having 120hz and always on display on a 900 phone is just sad at this point and for people like me that want to switch that makes it so hard to go for the non pro model when even my sad Samsung a71 has always on display On top of that for us in EU the base iphone costs as much as the pro in the US which makes this even worse imo"
Same copy  paste phones just with a different charging port by all means Apple take these peoples money 
That Blur later is something Google has been doing since ages and it works on objects people and any photo that has sufficient color and resolution and it works using AI its less accurate but more versatile and I wonder why people dont talk about it
Im confused between the iPhone 15 Pro and the Google Pixel 8 that will be coming next month And as always you are my main source of information for deciding between the two Thanks in advance
Android is better  I am poor
Ive an X so its time Wanted the always on thing so this does it for me  Sad the pros dont have the more striking colours of the 15 but not a deal breaker
Lucky for you then that Apple sells a Lightning to USBC adaptor for 29 or over here in the UK 29  36 which is a tad expensive
There was a leak that said these phones could charge at 35w so well see last years phones charge at 27w which isnt that bad
I have one question whats new in iPhone nothing just 10 faster than previous 
Wow iPhone just now getting usbc lol
Man would love to own the latest iphone shit would be bingchillin
"worst phone even they released
what stupid colors"
Why tout 2000 nits when its only in HDR and people hardly use HDR
and Im still watching this on my iPhone 6 with cracked screen 
I wonder how will run RE8 and RE4 Remake Is this processor so powerful
"60hz 
Design team practically sleeps for 23 years"
Welcome iPhone to the 2020s great to finally have you 
I am actually happy as a Android user because that is the end of my friends not having the same charger as me 
Before it came out I wasnt going to get it  Nothing has changed lol  I am as always looking forward to seeing the camera comparisons but Im pretty sure that my next upgrade will be the iPhone 16 next year Im hoping for an Ultra
Should I upgrade from the 11
The way they used pro in the chip makes me wonder what will the next base iPhone use
Seen other pov on TikTok of you using giant camera
But can I plug the phone into a computer to transfer my files yet
Shout out to the European Union forcing Apple to actually innovate
Remember Apple never wanted to put usbc in they were forced to So fast charging will take time
"Mother nature  here is the most nature friendly  phone human ever made
Samsung  omg why there is still no 120hz on this phone this is getting weird
Huawei  India will buy this phone mother nature in form of human is really lowers the human brains level"
Wooooow usb 2 in 2023 Whooaa thatss what i neeed  guys my note from 2018 has usb 3 support and a 2023 phone has usb2 Yes pleasee go buy iphone pleasee
Its a new iPhone like he mentioned I really dont see anything new comparing to other phones Whens the last time Apple introduced us something that impressed us Looking forward to that day
"Its a SAMSUNG GALAXY S22 ULTRA

finally caught on with a quick action camera huh "
"Camp Dont give a sht
How are people still paying so much for these minor cosmetic upgrades
SMH"
Base iPhone 15 still dont get 120 Refresh rate
Android still better and flexible Software
380k views in 45min  Ive waited all night for this vide SO from Namibia
"Anyone got an android charger My phones nearly dead
yeah"
Just a note Titanium isnt strongermore durable than steel It does offer a better strength to weight ratio though This is why youll see a lot of ultra light camping gear or bicycle componentry crafted out of titanium rather than metal or aluminum usually comes a quite the premium though
So glad we can all share battery banks and chargers going forward
4K60 HDR video out I feel this isnt being talked about enough
1310 Comments section Always open felt like a dig at Apple for keeping their comment sections turned off all the time I wanted to inform Apple that many users truly love Apple devices for their processors especially for gaming In fact Apple mentioned a bit about gaming on the 15 Pros So Apple why not consider introducing two AIR TRIGGERS on the side of the Apple phone along with a 6000 mAh battery
800 for a phone that doesnt have modern USB C capability with a USB C port No thank you Apple
nice so 22k for a usbc upgrade apple and its fans are an absolute joke to the tech industry
Im just watching to see whats new but have no interest in buying one The latest iphone that has peaked my interest was the 13 mini I have a 2nd gen SE that I just replaced the battery in and Im on the old IPhone 8 plus now Still a great phone
1141 Theyve removed the MagSafe Duo Charger from the Apple Store Presumably because the Ken Bumpus different and it would need to accommodate for that But it would be a great time to switch it to USBC
What about that pink Iphone
naah its the same I will continue with my 14 pro
Agree on the glass but the lighter weight reduces the force carried by the drop reducing the damage Could mean breaks less
I still have my iPhone 7 and I really dont see reason to replace it  Part of it is is because Im retired and so Im not grabbing my phone for much of anything at 60 and instead use the iPad Pro at home  There really hasnt been this tremendous innovation from iPhone one to 15  iPhone one was a great product but years later the 15 is a decent product
No such thing is future proof when it comes to anything Apple
That wouldnt seem like enough to warrant an upgrade But it seems we are at a point where phones have almost reached their peak in terms of features Both Android and Apple are finding it difficult to add musthave features
Can always count on MKBHD for accurate tech reviews
Yo why is he ok with all this fucked up petty shit Apple is doing with these phones
Did you just say Pro Res Video Is that confirmed
Random but 12x is what is deemed to be the most natural focal length with minimal changes to human features I actually liked the idea of a camera shortcut option
"What color is everyone going for with the iPhone 15 Pro
White
Natural Titanium
Blue
Black"
Apple will bring fast changing as a all new first in the world feature for 16 And also call it something else like ultra charge
Apple has no clue what the difference is between a feature enhancement and a new product is Oh New chipNew Phone Dynamic Island New Phone 1 gram lighter  New Phone
Samsung starts to put more ads on YouTube when the new iPhone launches and it always happens Do you agree
Pro Max in January for me I think might get the 1TB version too
Youre right not just USBC but old USBC
To be honest Ill wait for your onhand review to decide if Ill upgrade or not from the 14 pro Max 
Gaming beast of a phones
Fast charging destroys the battery
Trash phone but muricans will buy it cuz its an iphone Only thing thats decent is watch but overpriced
B E A N S
USBEESEE
MKBHD Apple referenced you for the MacBook 15 gotta love the influence your king
But still not impressiveiphone just upgrading small parts of the unit just to sell it for nxt yr youre just buying the brand and the thing called social status
USB 2 is a joke
USBC but no fast charging even for the more expensive pro models  Got it
Good ole buttons  Im most excited about the titanium and USB C I was already planning for this to be my first iPhone to not buy a case for and to just enjoy it in all its beauty so this titanium alloy and easy back repairs came right on time
The review weve been waiting for 
Samsung users are watching this right now including me even though they are not Apple fan 
Mac comes with a different port right 
"Apple Same phone as iPhone 11

Let me know when they can be arsed to do some work

They clearly working on the car"
Worst phone evaa
glass is the glass titanium for body
The pink one is too good
Definitely getting this Ive been rocking a increasingly tired 11promax and im glad to have quite a few new features to explore
Better processor better camera same phone
Its took us Soooo Much COURAGE to switch to USBC
What happened to the big Apple Carplay news they told us about last year 
Since they made it boxy all the iPhones look the same now lol
Cant wait to spend 1000 on a slightly updated version of a thing I didnt need in the first place
I wanted a new phone this year but this years iPhone was pretty disappointing Not sure what I expected because I knew it was one of those years where we shouldnt expect much but it felt like the only thing to really think about was the new button and USBC neither of which were important to me sure they are kinda cool but is that all you did this year apple
Apple has stopped innovating the way they used to
Apple stocks drops says enough
Not just USBC  Yes Its the old iphone with slow USBC for the normal model and speedy USBC only for the pro models Ah yeah And new colours I am content
Ofcourse iphone 15 will only get usb 20 
Im curious about the spatial video Which phones will be able to shot it
"Also now technically the 15 pro takes better 3x shots than 15 pro max
And 15 pro max takes better 5x and above photos So whats the point
Unlike the S23 ultra which takes best zoom shots in the S23 range across the board 1x 3x 5x 10x or 998x"
Not totally getting these
There were rumours about a new Lidar sensor Any news on that
The iPhone 15 pro is outstanding 
"Always baffles me that Apple has these gigachad chips every year and puts them to work on such timidly iterative and unoriginal tasks 
The shortcut button and the replaceable back are pretty nice additions that feel at least a bit like Apple is trying to do something fresh and listening to feedback"
im buying this in 2028 Just went from SE 2 to 12 Pro I wouldve bought 11 Pro if they had 128GB iPhones consistency is actually beneficial
Apple was forced to switch to USB by the new EU law  aaaand made it the biggest feature of its new iphone
So should I finally upgrade my 11 Max Pro
"I am very likely going to get the 15 Pro unless for some reason I decide I want the 5x zoom double storage and tiny bit more battery life of the Max 
Currently on a SE2 that I got when it came out Still mostly works but I had to replace the screen early this year cause I dropped it at work The screen protector was fine Glass was fine Touch digitizer was fine But the LCD itself cracked Since then the front camera hasnt worked and touch has been finnicky Also the LCD almost like freezes when its cold out Not what I expected for an ifixit screen

Im going to 3D print a shell of the 14 pro and max phones to see if Id be okay with a Max phone Or if itll be too big for my liking
Very happy with the size of the SE2 The Pro is pretty much the same size so for sure Ill be happy with it Maybe 18in thicker all around But the Max is 14in wider and 12in taller so Im not too sure if Id be okay with that
With my phone running on 3 cylinders I gave in and decided I was going to get a 15 Pro if it got USBC and an easier to replace rear glass or get a useddiscounted 14 Pro once their prices came down"
One of the worst update years Basically USB C is it And that has no impact on how I use my phone Feel like they are on autopilot mode
Nothing new same as usual the same old stuff brought by the apple expected wonders this time but apple never disappoint us did the same nothing big 
Shocked apple added USBC after being forced to Yet they still appled it up and limited it with  slow charging across the board and not making usb 30 standard speed
The base iPad got USBC last year
The standard 15 colors are really nice like the really light blue is so nice
Portrait mode switching after clicking a photo is available in pixel phones already Nothing groundbreaking here
I only trust your first impressions and event recaps
Reallyu guys think that this is better than previous one
They saving fast charging for next releases 
An 800 dollar at least phone with 60 Hz display should be criminal at this pointApple mehnnnn
Anyone say a random fan recording him from 3rd person view 
Samsung has had that feature Add Portrait effect since last year if Im not mistaken
Meh will wait for full Usbc functionality
Im happy with my 13 Pro Max  Maybe next year or the year after depending how it feels on iOS 18 and 19
Apple decided to shut down its RD department and they just clone the previous model
I will say the 15 has my eye and not the pro These are basically the S variants of previous phones
Im upgrading from a 12pro  its about time
"Damndid I just notice zero to no change
Love iphones"
USB C bebe
How is USB C the biggest headlining new feature The GPU claims and the possibility for console games to be playable on mobile is definitely more headlining than a port change Kinda crazy he just glossed over it
Surprised the external video recording didnt get a mention from a professional content creator lol
Im actually upset they got rid of lightening and the mute switch reason being I feel like its going to be VERY easy to accidentally muteunmute the phone and in my experience lightening while older is WAY more reliable and less likely to become wobbly also its better for when dust grime and liquid get into the charging port compared to USBC
Really new features Its the same product in a slightly updated package
Im  waiting for the Samsung Galaxy next year first before I decide I was hoping they would release an iPad mini but alas that didnt happen
They probably didnt want to go to USBC but had no choice due to EU putting pressure on them
Marques has gone soft on Apple its palpable
Lol most of the things are from Android stuff All marketing  
Dude fuck USBC the Action Button is wild
Wtf still no fast charging
It would be better if anker wasnt the sponsor tho
Yay Apple added a Bixby button
"Whys no one talking about the fact that the ability to make a picture into a portrait shot later had been on Samsungs for a while now

Or am i missing something "
This guy is such a shill
Still using my iphone 12 the 15 is new enough for me to change
I swear Marques could shoot video in a porta potty and make it look dope AF
Kudos to Marques for getting a shoutout from Tim Cook
How many of you noticed that Tim cook talked about Marques Brownlees comment on 15 Macbook in the Apple event itself MKBHD an influencer 
Its very interesting how much these iPhones resemble the personality of Apples CEO These phones used to be exciting and surprising like Jobs now theyre sterile and boring like Cook Still a reliable essential that just does its job I think smartphones are starting to be like glasses you need them they all do the same things exactly and the only difference between different brands and models is aesthetic
Really nothing new except type C
apple is saving fast charging as a feature for their upcoming iphones
They ralked noting of heat dissipation I hope they fixed it becauze iPhone gets so hot when gaming
You know what   That action button is already there samsung   bixby button  and those functions are available in volume button  as well in every Android phone 
This is the most boring update of all times
Thanks brother for wonderful detailed explanation about this Iphone15 new launchs
Why does the camera lens still stick out 2mm Why not just make the phone 2mm thicker and give us 10 battery life and a headphone jack
PLEASE LET THE BATTERY BE BETTER
Actually the big question to ask the women in your life Hey you love pink right So what do you love more pink or a better camera cause apple is making you choose
Ayo Davids GFX 100II 
Same iPhone with Different Names
This years iPhone pro series is quite disappointing actually was hoping for something better
I am so much in love with your updates 
Apple remove all this wireless shit including magsafe and increase battery Because when I charge  iphone wirelessly it overheating
We always trust your reviews Marques
"Im 100 in camp Interested in the new iPhone every year but never really impressed 

Although I think the base 15 was enough of an upgrade that I think its finally time to upgrade my wifes  iPhone 7"
"Yet another year an Im STILL keeping the Note10  Been had USB C on my Note10 half a decade ago

See ya next year "
Welcome to USBC world iPhone 15 series long live the Lightning Connector
60hz screen in 2023
lets not forget application sideloading now on IOS 17 without jailbreaking  D Thank you epicgames for pushing apple to make this change
I use a fold 4 as my main phone and 11 pro max as my secondary Even this iPhone 15 doesnt make me excited enough to upgrade it Should i wait again for another year Damn its been years from 12 13 14 and now 15
Whats that game called
THIS IS COOLL
Another product with nothing new made to gut the suckers that buy every generation
Iphone 14 pro  usb C  Iphone 15
"iPhone15PM vs iPhone14PMUSBC thats all 

And Its supposed to be in iphone14pm already shame on Applesucking blood from customers as always

Yeah and bragging some cheap color and other unnoticeable changes"
Thinking I should get the pro
If it ran android itd be perfect
BroooooIve been waiting for your impression Finally
i cant believe you after they put your review for MacBook on the event
How does the Dynamic Island look on the 15 series nonpro Is it as smooth experience as with a promotion display
Got the 11 since release and need to change it Cant decide between purple 14 pro or the new 15 pro ngl
Pretty cool to have the action button take the photos Itll feel like holding an old school camera when you hold it on the side and snap photos XD
So basically the biggest new feature is a feature that they were kinda forced into usbc And even then they fail to utilize it completely Other than that its the same old iPhone with some more things taken from Android phones mute button I am really having a hard time understanding why people still pay so much money for these phones Also I am curious to see how many usbc accessories that already exist for Android phones will actually work on iPhone Something tells me Apple will probably introduce some sort of licensing which will only let licensed accessories work on iPhones
I hope the Mini will return on next year 16 lineups
Thunderbolt will be on the iPhone Ultra I am certain of it
At this point I think having an iphone running the current iOS is enough reason not to switch to the new models for most people
why no one talk about 15 pro can record Prores directly to external SDD 
The best new feature you didnt mention spatial video recording But maybe its too soon to be relevant yet
Camp dont care at all The only thing that moves the needle for me is low light sensitivity fast charging and battery life
Video is so late
No way dude is taking a sponsorship from anker after what they did with Eufy and how they were straight up spying on people when their camera was supposed to be local only
Apple made 12x and 15x zoom a software feature Damn creativity pro max
You mean by 300usd Galaxy S20 FE 5G with USB 32 Gen 1 has faster wired transfer speeds than these overpriced non Pro iPhones
Not an apple fan but love your video
826 Its not about how easy it is to replace the parts Its more how difficult Apple it makes to make the parts work when you have done so Since they arbitrarily decide that the part you have used needs to be made sold by be checked and activated by them when you do so
no new ipad mini 7
I think I am the only one who notices the sections in the video are titled Tofu salsa beans guacamole taste test  fajitas 
You all have seen all these thingsfeatures in android or other phone but apple does it better we never stopped innovating 
No product red 
I only care about the battery life
bro got mentioned by tim apple at beginning of apple keynote Well played
Funny how a law change that forces it to go USBC turns into its Main Feature Tells you enough about this phone and how less inovative this one is
The problem is that its still an apple product In 4 years it will be as good as the current Samsung S line
899 is a bargain
Marques notification woke up the whole world now we up at 2am and have schoolwork in the morning
I have an iPhone 11 and still feel like there is no need for me to upgrade The only thing that feels old right now are the cameras but I have a mirrorless camera that can shoot better than 14 pro anyway
Apple adopts USB C late then gives crap charging speed So only half assed implementation unless you pay top  for the same thing all other manufacturers offer already in standard models Work is buying this if I get one
Waiting to see Apple iPhone coping the satellite calling feature from Huawei mate 60 pro and pro
Ram capacities
Still 60Hz retina on 15 base series instead of pro res 
I usually dont notice this in any videos but I noticed your audio took a big hit in this video It just sounded kinda weird but I understand youre traveling Its just weird I was able to notice it LOL
Would you discuss about LOG VIDEO RECORDING
I will wait for a Full screen iPhone pro max before upgrading from my 13 pro max
Love Mkbhd but this iphone is just usb c
Im using Nokia c3
Finally iPhone users will use the same chargers as Android users  no more Do you have an iPhone charger Although I think there will be people who would still call it that
I want to see a drop test please 
"Yeah technically titanium is stronger at the same thickness as stainless steel But Im pretty sure they have taken advantage of the titanium to use less material keep the same strengths as a stainless steel but with the advantages of less material less weight and less volume

Also even if the glass is what will break it is a matter of how much the metal rim deforms to be able to put stress on the glass So how much does a thinner titanium Rim deform compared to the thicker stainless one"
If iPad mini with A15 bionic can support USB 31 then making the new iPhone 15 with only USB 2 is just to limit its capability
Same iPhone as last years 14  just Slightly better  USBC  which every Android phone had since Android   you call those Upgrades   
"I think its finally time I try out apple Im still on my Google Pixel 4 XL but I need something new That blue Titanium Pro Max seems to be calling my name 
Im just a little apprehensive since Ive been in Googles butt cheeks for 6 years now"
But mostly just USB C
The titanium frame is just pure wank The better buy is the regular nonpro phone for anyone due for an upgrade
"Ive always been android and have no plans to switch  But the gaming stuff seemed amazing in the articles Ive read so far about the 15

Edit  Opinions arent facts  To those replying lmao"
Can we take some time to talk about why apple choose Marques Brownlee reviews in its event Never seen apple doing that Plus all that mother nature clip was funny as hell Also its the first time I heard apple mentioning the term repair
You are the only black guy whos isnt like those in the hoods
"i dunno when the last time you plugged your phone in
me  having used a wireless charger once not my phone nor charger"
So the same phone of the last 5 years
They really need to update the camera settings because going in the settings each Time to change 1 thing is horrible
anyone got a link to the wallpaper in the thumbnail
Eehh no big changes my s23 ultra takes pretty damn good pictures to the point where like 5 people switch their iphone 14 pro max to the galaxy s23 ultra 
Do you really need a new phone  Resist the wasteful practices that advertising has programmed you to perform If Apple really wants you to be ecofriendly then the best way to accomplish that is to simply stop buying so much stuff
So mkbhd was wrong when he said apple agreed to follow the European standards but doesnt mean that they will go with USB type Cin his one of the previous videos
This time i think pro max is the only option
I think after Steve goes to heaven  Apple have no innovation at all with nothing much upgraded in terms of features except better chips A person wont feel the difference between 14 and 15 at all Most videos only talk about the good etc but not whether it is worth buying 
The lack of fast charging is a gigantic bummer
Turning more android by the day
Seems like youre really hating on the new iPhones For one reason or another you always find a way to knock it or its features new build quality USBC ports etc not a good video The new iPhones are infinitely better than before
10 percent faster for 3nm What went wrong there
Ill wait until the hype is over
Do you think its worth the upgrade for some who owns any of the iPhone Xs
Thank god Marques posted
Meh I dont see that insane difference from my 13pro max im still gonna wait for that iPhone 8 to iPhone X type of upgrade
"On apples USB they did it because they EU forced them to so they decided to do it for all their phones They fought hard though claiming a forced USB port does hamper innovation They lost that fight Now on stage they are applauded for using USBC as if its their decision to be more up to date

By the end of 2024 all mobile phones tablets and cameras sold in the EU will have to be equipped with a USB TypeC charging port  reuters"
is 3nm chip not a big deal I think it is has significant effect on performance and battery life
Black 15 plus is looking good with the frosted back
Totally getting one But not right away I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max and Ive destroyed the back glass Plus itd be nice not to have to have a different cable than what my wife uses for her phone
BURANO or iPhone choices choices
Im in camp I kinda need a new phone but I can wait another year hahaha
Imma upgrade from SE2020 to pro max this year 
usb was the only thing I was waiting for
"Summon MKBHD cuz theres been a new launch of a Tech product

MKBHD fans federation


PS
The real launch happens only here not at Apple "
I cant believe we are excited about USBC 5x Zoom and action button iphones are damn boring Not buying shit
The design is soooo outdated
The most interesting part of the event was the mini movie with mother nature the rest  boring
"Its the same port all these other laptops tablets have had over the last couple years
You mean what everything else has had for the last DECADE"
Cant wait for the BTS on the Studio channel with the boys
Im upgrading my 13 pro exclusively because I want usb c My 13 pro still works great baring the degraded battery life But still looking forward to upgraded camera a lighter and more comfortable chassis and of course a usb c charging port to match every other piece of tech I have from the last few years
"This is literally how I watch this video no offense to MKBHD he made great video just on boring product

Back body build skip skip skip skip camera can blu skip skip skip skip skip other stuff pretty much the same skip skip skip skip 3nm chip skip skip skip skip skip usb c at only 20 speed skip skip skip skip No fast charging skip skip skip skip new design titanium rails skip skip skip skip  warm tone skip skip skip skip back glass more repairable skip skip skip skip my favorite feature a new customizable button just the pro version skip skip skip skip camera settings skip skip skip skip Anker line up awesome starts at 256g skip skip skip skip see you later peace

This is the first video where an ads content is better than the entire review of the iphone but fan people will praise it and splurge their money to get it Cool Economy works"
Why no one is talking about refresh rate of these iPhone displays
Usb c as a headline is crazy
The only YouTube I was waiting for to get a first impression Thanks Marques thanks EU
Engineers of this phone are the biggest geniuses Look even that outer titanium frame shape It is mindblowing
Innovation
l cant wait to upgrade to iphone 17
I will buy the 15 Pro Max in 202627 when I change from my current model X Im in no rush let them improve where they can improve
Hoping in the future we get a complete redesign of the iPhone instead of an update but glad we finally got USBC
Dont care at all my I phone 14 Pro looks like its gonna be enough for a couple more years I got the 1TB to have piece of mind on not running out of storage soon
Its the other way round your friends android cable will now charge your i phone
I just wanna know the battery size of the 15 pro max lol
I have an iphone 12 standard model and the iphone 15 reveal convinced me apple is not interested in making anything new anymore Will look towards a foldable next great video
Thanks for the good work MKB I got a unique question I dont like the dynamic island so how many years will it take for that to disappear from iPhone  I still use my iPhone 8 so I know how to wait D Or just maybe its time to try some android phone after all these years 
Still using my iphone xs with 73 battery health
typical L please no one buy this
cant wait for the review cant really decide if I want it yet lol
the most interesting thing is can shoot LOG
Steve Jobs would be rolling in his grave knowing they put a USB C on this thing
This guy is a living legend
"As is the case with me each time I have changed my phone I will upgrade from my 12 Pro Max to the 15 Pro Max if I get bored with it which is unlikely or if something goes wrong with my phone like breakage which is completely likely Phones are not a passion project for me anymore And phones these days seem to last forever Even the battery of my current phone is at a solid 85 three years in 
But yes I have no reason to not upgrade to another iPhone when its time I think thats where most people are at"
Moving from the 11 pro to the 15 pro makes sense for me now Only upgrade every 34 years
The USBc is very interesting to me And makes it a serious contender when it comes time to upgrade my phone However I might be holding out for a SE refresh when that gets the USBc If the SE gets the A15 or A16 core and USBc it becomes a much better value proposition
which is better 14 plus or 15 plus
Itd weird to see dynamic island in 60Hz 
The new default focal length is literally my favorite thing they announced lmao Im tired of zooming into 15x to get a 35mm equiv Now it can be forced Bliss
"apple sucks now
"
I like that they used a mix of that little African schoolkid singing its a beautiful day
One thing that keep in my mind Dropping the lightning port for the iPhone also means drop in some Apple revenue from selling thirdparty accessory licenses And I guess its a huge number loss How did Apple deal with this loss
Video starts at 405
If it doesnt come with a 2TB storage then Im not buying it
Is it still 60hz
Another year goes by without being able to afford them phones
stop announcing when you will say things later in the video just tell them straight away
"Presumably the same 48mp chip as in last years pro

No actually not and by extension the 48mp camera in the pro is the same sensor as was used last year

Its unreal how many of the tech press including yourself have missed this 

The 48mp camera on the 15 and Pro are very different sizes"
Wait how does apply not have enough room for the upgraded camera in the normal pro when they removed the SIM card tray and just have an empty space where it once was Is it filled in now or are they just doing apples things and spitting in our face
Dont care at all i think  for a tech keynote there wasnt anything exciting for the average user
This year for Apple sucks
yeah i think i will get one because of lidar not many reviewer mentioned this as a features but i think IP pro is the only phone on earth that i knew have lidar and its quite useful for certain field of job the only thing that have been holding me back from getting apple or iPhone just how the ecosystem that they have and its pretty inconvenience to move from android to apple product
He has been using the iPhone 15 for a month 
First
"Not worth it 

Will wait for next years"
He would say that there was more to it than just USB C MKBHD was featured in the launch BIASED
So basically few camera upgrades for pro versions a button  usb c to meet eu demands 
Its sad that most exciting feature in this is usb C
I didnt realize until I saw the review videos that the 15s have matte finish on the back across the board Im wanting an upgrade from the regular 14 because Ive tried the 14 Pro Max camera and dynamic island and I want both of those Im tempted by the 15 Pro smaller dimensions but Im not sure if its as big a deal as I hope it is Im a fan of the mini phones if only the battery had been better I like the natural and black titanium colors However with dynamic island the 48 MP camera and the matte backs on the 15 I may go with one of those But Im having a hard time choosing a color
Marquess is a beast on this tech review but its a bummer that the iPhone 15 doesnt add fast charging but still theres some cool stuff to try out no lie
In brief IPhone 15 is a master copy of IPhone 14thats it
"Tim himself took Marques Brownlees name during the event Now you know what impact Marques has on the tech industry

Hats off man"
Booooooorrrrrrriiiiiinnnnngggggnot you Marques but come on Applejeez
Not just cut down USBC They also include other cut down copied reworded features pay us more and you will get the full uncut usbc features
Actually didnt bought AirPods Pro 2 because of Lightning Ordered them instantly after the Keynote
One interesting remark about pricing Whle the US price remained the same the price in Germany and maybe other European countries was reduced Due to taxes it was always a lot more expensive iPhone 14 was 999 the 15 now is 949 The pro is around 100 cheaper than the 14
Gotta prepare myself for my family to start swiping my cables from me again being the only Android user of the family since last year
Done with apple and their BS  back to Samsung s23 ultra
Where is the iphone fold  
Kind of a let down of a phone We kind of figured there wasnt much to add at this point The improvements are pretty small I wont be switching from my 14
Hearing your views has always mattered to us even in decision making when upgrading or buying a new Iphone
Im waiting for the Vibranium iPhone
Thank Europe for the usb c
Head lining feature  usbc 
Dont not a big change to get a new one  Waiting to see if Elon is coming out with a X phone
I was waiting for this video
Respect for Europe making usbc law and still shame on you apple keep milking your hardcore fans
They labelled the the chip A17 Pro so that they can name the iphone 16 nonpro chips as the A17
Out of the world
YOU  GUYS AMPLIFY THESE STUPID LITTLE FEATURES AND MAKE THEM SEEM BIG CRAPPY COLORS TITANIUM SIDES NEW CORD SIDE BUTTON LMAOOOOO CMON AT LEAST GET A DIFFERENT LOOK
Preordering a 15 pro max in natural titanium on Friday going from a 12 pro max to this has me hyped 
As a proud EU citizen You are welcome America
Is the blue one the same shade as Midnight Blue of Macbook Air
Usb type c charger Wohooo The best Game changer 
camp  review
In Australia the pro max has gone up by 100 compared to last years model Wonder why Americans didnt get the price increase but we did Curious if any other parts of the world got a price rise
This just continues to show that Apple si nasty corporation like it ever was
I am going to an iphone 16 pro max nex year 
I think Apple has peaked in innovation and design
Honestly after never owning a iphone I might try it now because of usb c
What a serious waste of money Unless you are upgrading from an iPhone X this seems like a no go
I really think that Apple should have emphasized how the Lightning port also was a stopgap feature before USB C became mainstream but also to make them more money
Most boring iPhone update ever including fat Apple Watch Ultra 2 with same battery life 
Honestly I bought the iPhone 14 pro max almost 10 months ago and Apple sure knows how to introduce new things into their ecosystem and make everyone apart of that system feel like their phones could be sooo much better with honestly no more than 3 upgrades
As Im in my 2 year cycle Ill get the Pro in December
Thanks for keeping me up even later MKBHD Just finished uploading my Series 9Ultra 2 video and now Im forced to stay up even later to watch your video Love seeing the late night hustle Great video as always
Did they skip the fastcharging just to make their users think that USBC is crap
apples not leveraging usb cs full potential for a reason  its to show theres not much differencebenefits from lightning them being forced by EU  i believe the next iPhone will showcase usb cs full potential and they will call it advances apple has pioneered
I currently have an iPhone 11 Pro Max this new Pro Max is what Ive been waiting for For me it will be a complete upgrade From the edge design to Pro Motion to USB C dynamic island 5G capability and lets not talk about my current 64 GB storage Best of all is that with my current carrier Ill only be paying 8 a month if I give my current one as trade in Its honestly a huge win for me
Wow I thought the leaks were wrong and it wouldnt get usbc 
This is why I like your videos Completely unbiased opinions Keep up the great work my man
Ooo anker is a bad company these days Surprised you would work with them
Best thing about watching MKBHD videos is watching the view count tik on
Is it just me who saw wireless reverse charging for airpods pro somewhere
Wow Apple just invented USBC but not fast charging yet mybe nxt year
Fast charging degrades batteries
looks like iphone 11 for me
Suggestion please  been a Android user for my whole life  want to change to i phone  so i phone 14pro or i phone 15  pro
Early gang
That iphone 3 looks like new
Excited to see Longbeachgriffys video on the newsame Iphone 15
dont care camp
So its bad and 5 years behind 400 android phone xd
Some samsung users will notice that the action button is just a newer take of the old samsung active phones active button From what i can remeber it did the same thing as this new button
People want a whole new design These tiny incremental changes every year gets boring Also the prerecorded presentation especially the bit about mother natureOMG I just cant help but think what would steve jobs be thinking It was so cringe
USB C because the EU forced us to put it in thats why
Does it comes with charger
5x only for iphone max  hmmmm apple
There was hardly an improvement
When you do your videos on the new iPhones coming out they feel like Reruns Because iPhone dont charge much
Wow USB c and better speeds in a phone in late 2023 What a time to be alive  Maybe youll get fast charging in 2026 for a small price of 1999
Things that androids had for years that would work better on iOS Nothing special but i still kinda want it
i think 15 is the sweet shot for us not pro photo enthusiasts i have a Insta360 as well I just cant see the 350aud extra worth it for me dont do much video and more photos thanks for the best review on the net waited all day here in Australia for you to post thanks also for your car stuff just ordered BMW x1 EV which will take 6 months to build and ship can you do a review of it for me
"For price sensitive markets like India I think the iPhone 15 Plus is quite a sweet deal Sure it doesnt have the ProMotion display but other than that it has every thing that a first time iPhone buyer will like Dynamic Island was one thing due to which I never bought iPhone 14 14 pro and pro max were out of budget and they still are for me But with DI on the 15 lineup there are hardly any software features that I wont be able to enjoy
The 256 GB version of 15 Plus is listed as INR 89999 which I am expecting during the upcoming festive sale on Diwali will come down to 80K Another 1517k as exchange value for my current Android and it would become a nice midtier phone in the range of 6365K INR I think I will go for the plus this time

BTW congratulations on getting featured on the keynote my man"
I can easily wait until next year
Massive
this guy is now in another league now that a thing he said was featured in the event
Its not enough for me to trade in my 13 Pro
I dont use iPhone so I dont really care about this change but imagine being an iPhone user with a bunch of accessories that use lightning port earphones  then this happens 
Ironic getting Samsung abs to skip to watch iPhone 15
"Sucks that Apple products dont have fast charging and all chargers are low watts
I order the Anker 3 in 1 Cube with Magsafe for my niece bday for all her Apple products
Is the only brand I trust
I do want to get the Anker Nano Charging Station
6in1  67W"
Those like me who cant afford the new Iphones gather here please
"First 

Great informative video as always  Appreciate the effort that goes into these 

Secondly i dont wanna speak to soon here but I believe this could be the beginning and my falling away from apple I didnt set my expectations high as I know how apple works as we all do but as I was watching this video I still felt underwhelmed with the lack of opportunity apple had especially with the USBC I have a iphone 13 pro max  this very well could be my last iphone not than its a big deal but I always hold out a little hope with apple in hopes of them doing what we all know they can"
I purchase a new iPhone every 2 iterations Im excited for this release Im still rocking the 13 pro max So I dont have dynamic islands Great video Mkbhd as always
You were hard at work editing this to have posted it at like 130AM
I cant wait for everyone to be pissed of cuz they cant use there old cables even though the new ones are better
"Big name Marques Brownlee 
Your Name were placed in the Presentation of iPhone 15 Launch Fantastic 
Big achievement by MKBHD"
300K views in 30 mins Dude
Does the custom button work as a shutter button
Is iPhone 15 non pro model a better value phone at 800 
"I really dont care about these
My iPhone 14 Pro is basically these an iPhone 15 Pro"
Must be exhausting to fly every year to talk about the exactly same device with tech from 5 years ago well at least you get paid well for it
Cant wait for the whole review
"This video was super viable for me As I understood the new camera comes only with the 15 Pro Max not the 15 Pro 

I will think about buying a 14 Pro instead of a 15 Pro now"
My 2 year contract is about to end but I think Im gonna wait for the 16 and see whats up with it Still happy with my 13 pro although I wish I couldve waited a bit for the 14 pro and gotten the better camera This 12 mp aint cutting it
R u saying Ceramic Shield is weak Huh boi my phone fell down the stairs not a scratch boiii
Dont care at allfor the first time 
If switch from x or 11 it will be great update
Im getting one but Im not sure if the pro max is worth it over the pro
Apple arent even trying anymore
"Action button
More like bixby key"
"More repairable

Zack will find out pretty soon for all of us"
"Oooooooooh aaaaaaaaahoooooooooooooooohaaaaaaaaaaah ooooooooooh aaaaaah

Here at Apple the lack of innovation is a feature"
Im still using XR so I would have upgraded this year no matter what
I know its far fetched but I think they know the cost of living I hindering many ppfamilies from splashing out I think thats one of their considerations to make sure the normal iPhone user will upgrade and will feel like theyre still getting the latest while feeling like theyre not breaking the bank its still a shame that Siri hasnt become AI or has it I dont know it still seems way behind but also maybe based on the usage of Siri it hasnt seemed very necessary to upgrade because people havent fully appreciated AI for what its worth as yet  to be quite fair to Apple and all other phone makers theres not much hardware you can really do to make a phone more brilliant yes perhaps an invisible front camera and sensor would be divine but I guess its s lot harder than the average person can conceive All in all probably will upgrade to 15 PM just because any updates for the 17 pro chip will enable updates for many years to come
Samsung is offering a 1200 trade in value if we get the Fold 5 for 14 pro max confused if its worth going to the Samsung world
What about spatial video
Nice iPhone 11 pro max
Zoomin effect during the talk is getting annoying and boring
Im quite happy with this new iPhone glad to see the reduced weight especially compared to the heavy 121314 Very ready to retire my XS Max
"So will the IPhone 15 support always on display 
I"
I absolutely hate the baby bluegreenpink colours for the base iphones and secondly the usb20 on the base phones feels like a very underhanded move from appleespecially when features like having 90120 Hertz display or a usb 3 port are something you dont even bother asking before buying a android phone
Im an iPhone user But I know pretty well that android phones never introduce a new feature and not let the users get the maximum benefit unless they go for the expensive model
minor updates
steve is rolling in his grave
I am honestly excited for these new features Especially the USBC like finally
needs to be said no one gets a kick out of apple keynotes anymore
its the same phone guys dont buy it
"im in cant afford it 
still going to continue with my xsmax"
Im planning on getting the 15 pro max to replace my 13 pro max But yeah it feels like the only real substantial change is USB C
Wow great job apple my PCs have had USB 30 for 15 years Glad you caught up
I have 13 pro max and Im not gonna upgrade Especially MKBHDs full screen width content gets screwed with dynamic island
Seems like they have ran out of ideas or they are just playing safe to milk the money
Channel has become IGN for technology Talks smack about Apple but when it comes to ANY product he promotes to no end
15 Pro team looking to get my first iPhone ever
its the same garbage lol yall eat anything up
OMG This announcement was the most innovative most insane I have ever seen 
Fast charging tech came almost 10 years ago iPhones not having such basic feature just shows how little Apple cares about their iPhone customer bases real needs
I am interested in seeing the new 24 MP binning format on the 15 series hopefully it improves colour science and hdr
I could care less about iPhone but Im glad the assholes finally added USB C Itll be good for both camps
Can we just assume at this point that the next generation base line Iphone will just be the pro from the year prior minus larger size I cant help but feel this is a trend
Waiting for the Xperia 5v and Pixel 8 to dcide
Its crazy everyone can be hyped with the same phone every year
Still taking Anker money after the Eufy debacle
While the front screen glass is the same being lighter results in less force in impact ifwhen you drop it so less chance to break
lol most people that wanted the typec port was for the fast charging lol
Its iphone 14 with type c
I mean everyone complains about it being the same phone but isnt Samsung now doing the same
Imma good
iPhone 1515 Pro impressions Barely more than USBC
Last years screen last years camera hardware super disappointing cpu upgrade  3nm node seems to be a complete dud
As an Android user seriously considering to switch but the lack of fast charging even on the pro models seems to be a deal breaker unless the battery life can show to not need any charging during the day
BOOOO STUPID EU im gonna miss the Lighting charger 
Good video and I like that youre not overly praising apple for their boring and repetitive iphone
What a joke My Samsung phones and tablets have had USB C for years And reverse wireless charging My Z Flip 5 is miles ahead of the iPhone in innovation and usability My Samsung Watch 5 has had hand gestures for awhile And why would Apple make an expensive new phone in 2023 with USB C 2 So they can upgrade it to USB C 3 in 2024 and the faithful will upgrade
Same like a last iphone  fuck im stay and wait
"My S21U has USB 32 and its two years old

Titanium is a stronger but soft that steel so youre going to get A LOT more dents on the case"
This video made me not upgrading my Iphone
S23 ultra is still a beast
WE HAVE FINALLY KILLED THE IPHONE CABLE BOYS CELEBRATE WITH ME
i wil be holding my iphone 11 untill next year great video
USB c is the biggest feature nowadays 
Biggest change coming from The EU
I miss the days when Apple provided major upgrades every two years and their intermediate upgrades were reserved for the S models You knew what you were getting with an S vs a new number iPhone I still dont see a compelling enough upgrade to ditch my iPhone 13 Pro Max
Thank you EU for forcing apple to be reasonable
Dude the ability to hook up an SD drive for storage is huge to me
540 wait am I the only one who frequently uses USB for data transfer
In their preso video even Apple itself takes the redundante Island away when presenting screenplay Remover the Island while playingwatching
Ive been a SamsungAndroid user forever considering switching just to give it a try but Im also hesitant because iPhone literally isnt that crazy like you mentioned many features I already have and so do other phones Im conflicted but want to learn more
Not interested since iPhone 13 Nothing exciting or new
Everyone lets welcome apple to 2023
longbeachgriffy
god apple sucks now
Loving how the iPhone 15 Pro lineup is returning to the same palette as the 12 and 13 models  I think Apple nailed it with those choices and should be adding rather than replacing the palette  Would loved to have seen a maplebronze titanium but titanium blue looks slick
Do we really need iphone 15 if iphone 14 is working fine
USB C will you need official Apple chargers though
MkBHd is a Ugandan 
Im in the Dont Care At All camp  it reverts to being a Version1 so Ill wait to see what you guys make of it in the medium term then maybe think 16 in 1218months time cos my 13Pro is doing fine as a secondary to my Xperia1 
I remember having a blackberry and being able to program any key as a shortcut Yay we have 1 customizable button now 
That Anker check must have been big lolol
For the record 30 minutes late to MKBHD video is quite early 
looking forward to the full review Leaning towards getting one though
Yeah Im waiting for S24
I really hope that next year they make the portless iPhone with an increase on wireless data transfer speeds
lol is this even worth watching haha this is a joke
iPhones finally catching up to the Pixel features from years ago Slow clap Apple 
15 Pro Max is only 5 grams lighter than my 12 Pro Max
Overall  pro max is a solid upgrade with heaps of small improvements and its looks good too 
I waited for this review all night  Thank you
USB 20 in a phone that costs almost 1K I am speechless
Whats your verdict on the Huawei Mate 60 Pro with 7nm Chinese Made Chip Am still waiting for your view on that
Can you make a vid for like if you have a iPhone 12 Pro to which one do I upgrade I think its time for a new one but I cant handle to max version so do I go for a pro 15 or normal 15 or is like the 14 pro better My main focus is like camera wise Im not a gamer on my phone
The did the USBC switch because the EU forced them too Under EU law all phones have to be USBC now Apple could have had USBC just for EU markets and something else in other countries but realised it would be sensible to just upgrade the phones to USBC everywhere So thank you EU
I care quite a lot but will keep rocking my 14pro max for one more year Lets see what the 16 than has to offer Cheers do look forward to the reviews 
I think this is the first time that Marques has asked to subscribe three times in a video
woah 
Thanks for the update
They gonna save fast charging for iPhone 16 and charge even more money
can we change the charger port on the iphone 14 to the USBC one
Its Amazing Bruh
Nas Slow it Down on the intro my man
what about apple letting us choose what the special button does even if it was a switch
"Apple calling influencers by plane to an event showing how net carbon neutral they are is peak insanity So much carbon just to hold a brick for a couple minutes
CARBON NEUTRAL MY FOOT"
Sad we didnt get a dedicated Siri button s
Im just mad I cant finance it unlocked with my Apple Card I have to select a major wireless carrier
Is it just me or theres something wrong with the audio
Just the video I was looking for
I laughed when spoke about gaming android has literal phones for dedicated gaming but havent able to this level EVER
what a let down Also dropping the 13 mini is such an stupid move
"1st they complain that android widgets are confusing

2nd they complain androids have a different charger even tho its the universal charger

3rd they complain about green bubble just give this one 5 more years and iPhone will switch to green bubbles too"
So they should include plug considering their reason when they removed it in the box
Usb c does get me closer to seitching to apple but its gonestly crazy that its taken so long I see people charging their vapes with usb c now
Cant believe you forgot to mention Firewire
best of luck   new type c port 
Im so glad it looks the same and they didnt add much How much is it again 
Watching Apple being competitive again is unreal
I just dont like that apple is only going to give me 650 for my 14 pro max
043 i gotta fix my mind
Still watching this with my iPhone 12 Pro Max 
I really hate apple for ditching 3X zoom for cutting costs Portraits from 3x are really great You cant move far enough to get a good 5x Portrait in most conditions It should have given both lenses 
It sounds so petty but I refused to even consider iPhones because of the lightning port Now it may be a contender for my next upgrade 
Love your reviews Thank you so much 
Im still holding out to see how theyre going to tackle sideloading Without proper sideloading Ill never get one
Im waiting for s24 Ill never return to apple
Skip these iphones buy last years or next year but not these 
Sadly ama buy it 
Delete one camera and 120hz from iphone 14pro Name it iphone 15 Amazing 
Action button sounds fine but I am bummed out that a dedicated Mute button is gone The biggest thing I like about the current mute button is that I never have to look at the screen to know whether the phone is muted or not Also its nice that you can do it discreetly precisely  because you dont have to look at it and gave away your intention
Basically as every year with every phone not just from Apple There is no feature justifying going from the last years phone to this one The time is over I guess the next big leap for Apple will be a folding iPhone and until then it will be small changes Im thinking about getting one but i dont already own a 14 pro max If so i wouldnt upgrade for sure
Titanium is not stronger its lighter
Usb 20 was release in 2000 and usb 30 in 2008 talking about new port
Apple users used to say the weight is a proof it was premium phonemade with premium materials now Surprise surprise they now say it feels light because it is made with premium materials
Apple is literally fooling its customers by giving 60hz n no updates at all
"This is a pretty awesome change but as youve said in other videos Apple seems to do things in two year phases Theyve finally got USBC and thats that Next year I think theyll make the really big changes with the iPhone 16 So if Im gonna get one itll be then Its a step in the right direction just not quite time yet

Plus the Pixel 8 is shaping up to be a pretty awesome phone so well see when that comes out next month"
This is what ive waiting from you Mr Maqs
Half a million views in 30 mins
"I think coming from the 12 Pro all the little quality of life changes will be very welcome in the new 15 Pro 
Actually excited to get ride off all my lighting cables  Finally I think I have been on about this since 2016 
Not much to really write home about in this iPhone though
I think they really have to start getting mad creative with the software cuz the phone is clearly OVER powered at this point
That power seems wasted opening apps lol"
Honestly I have the iPhone 13 mini and I was considering upgrading but Im going to wait one more year I feel that this launch was rushed Not to be that person but I have a feeling the 16 might be a bigger upgrade but who knows lol Also was considering getting a Samsung Fold but might also wait another year hoping for a new design and I love my mini its a shame they wont be making another 
those apple id card at the sofa nice  
Why is no one talking about spatial video That shit was so cool And being able to play the latest Assassins Creed on an iPhone Bruh
"Faster charging is with ONLY SPECIAL CABLE They mentioned that on stage 
They never miss to do things apple way "
How much hype for this   he has be come a apple ads channel
now i wonder what tech android already has the apple will adopt 8 years into the future
My man MKBHD dropped a video at 2am EST lmao
Another scam from Apple
USBCfinally 5x zoomfinally Wifi 6Efinally I had all these features on my S21 Ultra The S23 Ultra is still the phone to beat
excellent rundown thank you 
USBC on a Apple phone Welcome to Android standard for years  
They have introduced USBC as new feature for iPhone
"apple running out of ideas lol 
for the 1st i didnt install IOS 17 beta
no jailbreak so no ideas and give us lil silly things in update 
bin using iphone from the 1st gen and my next phone might just might be an android
love your comtent MB"
No mention on the battery sizes and apparently no improvement in Pro screen brightness specifically Going to wait for 16 pro to get Thunderbolt  better screen tech  smaller dynamic island
MKBHD I am not going easy with the review even if they mentioned my name in apple event
Legendary Lightning type C 
Great video as usual but Im just not sure theres enough to make me upgrade from the 12 pro max still Will probably wait and watch the reviews though
I feel like Im the only one dont get excited for 15
To say the upgrades are incremental is an understatement at this stage I honestly think we should collectively move to a 2 year upgrade cycle with new model releases
Hey why is non pro iPhone model dark blue at 053 Anybody knows
But its not the same usb c that every other device had for years  That would be usb 32 But apple being being appleShouldnt they be criticized for that  they went with the 2008 technology which is 30 Right
Wait till the honeymoon period is over This would feel like the same old thing
What a waste of a button  Just one action  Why no actions for double or triple tap especially given you can do some of that by tapping on the back
WOW SOFT SIDE ON THE EDGES ON THE SIDE AND USB C NOW WOW IM GONNA BUY NOW THANKSSSS
I feel they didnt include Fast Charging so when they go portless they can say Hey dont worry it takes the same amount of time to charge as it did when plugged
I am using the iPhone 13 Pro and I have been happy for the last almost two years And I am still excited that I do not have to change it this year either
Why is the new iPhone so boring 
I feel like nothing has changed at all
The USB C port is a win for regulators consumers and privacy loving zero wasters everywhere  Lets hope Tesla chargers are required to go universal  too
I have an Ipad pro second gen I use for design work It is a fantastic tool and I truely love it it is amazing but as a mobile device it has some serious shortcomings In actual use the charging cable literally cant keep up with the power draw Only the apple blocks will charge it My wife has an iphone SE 2 years old and it is CONSTANTLY below 30 battery usually hanging on at around 35 Apple products are indeed slick and they do have some pretty neat features but they always seem to sacrifice SOOOO much basic functionality that doesnt feel like it needs sacrificed I have been buying motorola phones the last few times and have owned plenty of apple phones over the years and it really is a much better device I can plug it in and it damn near smokes with how fast it charges 0100 in 30 minutes or less and it keeps a charge all day has good cameras and a great screen and best of all moto actions where i can shake it a certain way to instantly pull up the flashlight or phone which are far and above my two most common phone uses There is literally nothing here that sells me on apple at this point the iphone is stale and needs a serious rethink It is literally the same damn thing as the second gen all these years later  If any phone manufacturers are watching I want something that fits in my pocket like my old flip phones has kickass camera speakers light and battery and wont break when dropped  give me a man phone that is a tool and I can use for sports that isnt a lunch tray and wont break when dropped These used to exist
All i get from first impression vids of the Iphone is its port change to USB C and I think everyone saw this NEW headline coming to Iphones from several years ago Theres nothing even special about it No new improved charging speed or whatnot
RIP Lightning cable You will not be missed
how do you feel about them quoting your MacBook air 15 review
"USB 2 and no fast charging in 2023 

My 300 phone has 67W charging and usb 3"
One cable to conquer them all
Watching this video like I am able to afford Iphone 
Stupid question to ask But is iPhone 15 going to be a good upgrade from my current iPhone XR 
Boooooring max
"Been waiting soo long to get one of these specifically iPhone 15 Please drop the review ASAP
Love MKBHD "
S23 ultra is better
Innovation is officially dead in iPhones I mean come on theres nothing innovatively new in these iPhones So disappointing
The most surprising thing to me is that it isnt even as good as the s23 ultra Come on apple
Funny how Apple make a big deal on the pro model with the usb controller while you cant even transfert HEIV files on your PC when you shoot 4k on your iPhone
60hz screens on the nonpro iPhone 15s is just ridiculous at that price point
"who would have have thought that an unknown kid with a below mediocre camera started shooting in his home would be recognised by a a company like apple
congratulations marques for making it to the top and to get recognised by a trillion dollar company is just  surreal so happie to be a part of ur journeyno wonder people drool over ur videos ur the best manpeace"
glad to see apple finally replacing the lightning for USB  it was overdue  I agree that the update is a little underwhelming  I still have the iPhone 12pro and will likely not update  maybe next round
Upgrading my iPhone 11 Pro Max this year Its time 
USB C version kind of bummer and no fast charging typical 
actually i have been thinking a lot I had been thinking so much that I didnt have the time to think about what to comment Let me think for a lil bit
Theyre just renaming the same old phone
Why is no one talking about the curved edges
Apple shouldve gone with thunderbolt That way they can technically be both following the law and not following the law in the EU
Of course they would knee cap usb3 on the pleb versions 
Legit black male you can trust Always says what he wants Respect that
Did they even talk about the battery performance in the keynote
So wait again for another new one
Brand New Design  Apple 2023
A request to MKBHD They used your review in the keynote But dont get chummy with them soldier It could be a ploy Be the real critic as youve always been Much love
"Iphone introduce type c
Androids First time"
In some years theyll have fast charging too
Iphone pro for gaming 
So its the same phone all through almost
I feel like he is talking unusually fast in this video Almost like it was slightly sped up in the editing
If the iPhone 5s comes with a full battery then it might sell a lot
Im getting the blue 15 Pro Max 1TB that will be my phone for the next few years until the iPhone foldable
Surely steel is stronger than titanium
the lighting in your talking head set up looks so crispy
Anker Bad
Who wants Apple to raise their factory workers wages We have to get em a raise Theyre putting out such high quality products so it is only fair that they get a raise
The fact that Tim Cook mentioned mkbhd at the start of a apple official live stream for 15 inch macbook is insane
"Have been waiting ever since the keynote for the video to drop  
Great initial impressions looking forward for the full review "
I dont like that new silent switch it didnt need to be redesigned I feel its something that shouldnt have been touched at all
"Are they promoting the UsbC as a new feature too 
When they were actually forced by the EU to switch to it"
Couldnt sleep today and boy am I happy there was a new video out
USB plug to me is the most useless  change I can imagine Ive been on a third party mag plug adapter and hence a single cable for years now
I used to be upset that apple didnt change much each year but I realized they didnt because there isnt much to change Its already pretty awesome Like my 13  pro max Still just as great as day one that i got it
Android
Welcome to the another episode of  Cant Afford Still watching  
Im getting it and for a man with over 17 million subscribers could never go wrong
the actual review of the phone is hidden here 348 
I am an Android person and I will never understand the hysteria Apple fans suffer from All their phones look identical year over year and simply have slightly improved specs that 90 of user dont even know they could use The vast majority of Apple users are teenagers that receive them as gift because frankly their price is well above what someone that has to work fo afford one would spend Ofc the 10 that really uses iPhones capabilities happily spend such a hefty sum But for the remaining 90 its just showing off
As an exclusive Android user this makes me happy I always carry around a lightning cable just for my friends because their phones always need charging now I dont need to anymore hopefully they can bump up to a really good charging speed Like 50w or higher finally were getting into some universal stuff this makes me happy
What a torture to watch that apple event yesterday what a disaster of event it was after that train wreck Im never gonna buy any apple product ever again  That was a f mockery of a customer
They are keeping FAST charging feature for iPhone 16 pro max 
I dont see people upgrading from lastgen models it is just repacking of 14 pro to its latest iteration Most prominent thing is USBC port Only people are upgrading would be from 13 or earlier models So for gaming they said this is for the first time a console version of the game would be available on Mobile
The lack of the Mini makes me so sad God I hope my 13 Mini lasts long enough
headline feature is being forced to use a cable invented in 2014 im so done with apple
USB 2 speeds on baseline iphones is such a bummer
wait 15k likes and 0 dislikes thats fake right
I dont get why they call the new portraits next gen its not new in the industry and has existed for at least 3 years AFAIK But its cool that they finally introduced it to iOS
Always love these videos because you can tell how unbiased they are even when the event is honoring you for being there lol
So basically the iPhone 14 pro should also have these features if the 15 is the 14 pro Right
Dynamic island on the iPhone 15 was new
Samsung has that blur later feature
Man apple phones are overratedjust need a good release from pixel or Samsung that destroys these overhyped iphone
I do not want to say that but I must  Apple has been s doing the squeeze tooth paste stuff  In 2023 and you still just USB 3  Some palm size NUCs have USB 4 ports  They are cheaper than an iphone pro  The premium price must have the same premium features to match  USB 3  Really
They running out of ideas
"Apple using your tweet as an endorsement for one of their new products in their AppleEvent is the ultimate superstardom for a tech YouTuber if thats a thing
If anything could be better than this then it has to be NASA Who knows that may happen someday since you have contacts like Neil "
Not tempted by the USBc since my Airpods and iPad 9th gen use lightning connector 
"Ill be happily waiting for your full review so I can finally decide whether to change from android to iPhone Cant waittttt 
Congrats on the shoutout btw "
This was the most Linusian transition to a sponsor Ive seen on this channel
just wait 6 months latter they release the pro pro one with fast charging lol
The iphone 15 is simply the Iphone 14 pro max just regular
What The physical switch is gone That is one of the greatest long term iphone features in existance Cant believe they got rid of it Its so useful to at a glance check your phone is on silent
Is it only me or the phone doesnt look as boxy as the 14 series
Was kind of looking forward to get cinematic 4K 60 They have a monster chip to have this so why not
Leta be real it is just the usb c thats different And they made it look even more for woman with those colours
They didnt mention the type c at all unless I missed it
They didnt mention the new tones In the iOS17 RC there is all new ringtones and text tones that sound sick
Thinked on iphone but ima stay in folding from samsung smartwatch and the ring in next year 
Is AV1 builtin decoder only for 15 pro models what is it useful for and by how much Live streaming
Apple only switched to USBC because they were forced to by the EU Also they are artificially limiting the transfer and charging speed so that the next few years they can speed it up a bit and sell it as a new feature on new iphonesthats how Apple does their business
Who up I been waiting 
i know for a fact these phone gonn be flogged off for 3 times the price just imagen the price there gonn resell for
Not goona lie with this apple trend I might switch from iPhone 14 to iPhone 19 or 20
The most hypocrite brand talking about how to save environment while takin so long to change into usb C
keeping my 13 mini lol nice video They could have given action button to all 15 I understand some feature in pro that needs strong hardware so you cant have em in regular 15 but action button is more of a software upgrade maybe im wrong seems like everything is about the cameras with these phone bring desktop safari like iPad It was so funny to see them compare regular 120mm lens with their phone lens i use everything apple from computers to phone but when shit is not right you have call it Like the monitors 
Android has had that portrait feature for ages
Waiting for 2 nm processor on iPhone and Android
Finnaly Apple decided to put USB C on the Iphone because of the benefits and not because of the UK compliance
What is the weather ok let me click the side button
Yay same thing diffrent year we are zombies work eat buy sleep repeat
Can someone tell me whats the difference between how apple updates their phones and how EA treats Madden every year
And Apple will give you an USB 20 cable in the box
Ive only one question about iPhone 15 Pro How tf is it possible to play resident evil 4 remake on it
Im still on iPhone 8 Plus and there was nothing particularly compelling about any of the new offerings other than possibly the ability to store video directly to an external hard drive to run out and get one of the new models With my battery still holding on fairly well I might end up putting off the decision to upgrade until it is almost time for the 16 to come out
20 something watt charging and a 60Hz screen is just embarrassing for a 900 phone
Still no 120hz on the iphone 15
wild that were just all accepting that phones wont come with 35mm headphone jacks anymore
Good riddance to lightening
JUST BUY IT AND BURN MORE MONEY 
Now Im really interested on iPhone but could never afford it in the latest release That dynamic island looks dope af And the simplicityminimalism on its display and design is what I need
Super boring phones
Oh well Apple takes so much time to puts things together wonder what could come up if the launch window for new products phones were at least 2 years 
I guess if you buy a new iPhone every year its not a huge jump But when I eventually upgrade from my iPhone 11 it should be a noticeable upgrade
is the same set of cameras in iphone 14 pro not max found in iphone 15 pro like basically no physical camera upgrade for iphone 15 pro
Ill say it again I hate the dynamic island And the iPhone event was rather boring ie better processor more camera stuff and a revamped button Boring
"watching these really made me depressed abt how low iPhone users standards are     


Typed on an iPhone"
Considering switching back to iPhone after 6 years on Android It is kinda nice that I dont have to swap chargers now
I think apple is really slowly is differentiating between the the each iPhone with major features And also they are increasing the difference to the next level between pro and non pro with the processors  like now the pros get the pro chip and non pros get the bionic chip So I thought in the next apple series of phones will the bionic chips are dead or will they release a new a17 bionic Will see
Cant wait for Marques take on whether to go iPhone 15 or 14 Pro when upgrading from 12 or earlier
I cannot buy this crap
To me this phone brings more disappointment than excitement
Wow you wouldnt believe its the same as last year 
Same features every year  lol 
Im getting the pro Max but certainly not from my country Pro Max starts here at 1930USD 
60hz on the base models is a horrible decision why do they want to rip off their customers is beyond me
Still same 0 Innovation Trash technology wastage of money
Its almost a joke that a 2023 IPhone limits you to 20 Usb speeds and slow charging
OTR I can say the 48Mpx camera is the same previously in the pro Enjoy your time in Cupertino
Not gonna lie my first thought for that button when you said it could do Siri Shortcuts was using it to launch a better voice assistant
Dont care to buy an iphone at least yet Im just watching because I like watching your videos 
The sound too much echo
Not much but the subtle changes are quite significant If you recently got the 14 pro or 14 pro max you should have been a little bit patient for the 15 pro and 15 pro max
You say the usbc port is a HUGE deal In your next sentence its just usbc no big deal
Im in the camp of will this iPhone be good enough for me to leave Samsung Looks like its another big nope Says the person typing this out on a Macbook Air 15
Im waiting for iPhone 16
Same old sht with different coloe
The reason why I got the s23 ultra more features I care about and more for me on the android side
Something happened with your mouth or am i the only one seeing this
"Wonder  Lost 

This is the first time since the iPhone classic that I think about to buy a Android Phone 

Apple whats wrong with you 

I this a woke weak zero CO2 presentation 

I will never watch again the full presentation again 

With this bad Mother Earth storytelling 
you lost me completely

I switched to Black List 
what I have seen 5 times before 

So weak and super annoying 

Wonder  Lost"
Low key pretty smart of apple to hold off on the usb c port otherwise there would literally be no difference between last years phone
As someone who just bought the 14pro max I dont have any fomo vibes from the release Nice additions but the 14pm is just fine
Why it sounds like Apple invented the type C The customizable button android has it for years
There should be a way to have the action button to turn off sound and disable mic For Sensitive Meetings
Oh thank you our generous fruity overlords for giving us more of what everyone else already has 
Appreciate the 411 Stay Blessed
The iPhone and Apple watch for that matter just doesnt have the pull it used to anymore The new features are too little of a novelty to reign in any Android user into the ecosystem I imagine
       
How does apply do this They finally put usb c on their phone yet they somehow turn usb 30 a standard that came out in 2008 into some sort of upgrade worth paying for Apple is the only company that can make something worse and sell it as an addon worth upgrading for
Ill stick with my 14 pro max for now
Well I dont think the new iPhone 15 is worth upgrading if you have a iPhone 13 or iPhone 14 their only slight changes and its not worth spending money for the USBc charging Yeah if you have the money then its okay but otherwise its not that much changing in the lineups
Been waiting for usbcIm upgrading  
Whats the refresh rate for regular 15
"Yeah to summarize 120 hours of presentation
 New watch brighter screen and you can tap now Who is buying this as a yearawaited upgrade
 New iPhone last year Pro in basic body same chip same camera literally only typeC is new waited for what 10 years and now its here thank you EU laws
 New Pro is the only thing NEW The chip has a small performance up but much extended versatile functions like ray tracing for gaming or typeC improvement so that huge Raw files dont take an eternity to transfer
 Titanium closure is very nice lighter and prettier plus durable and slightly rounded edges so that the phone wont cut your hands FINALLY
 Great work was made with cameras at least on paper Its a huge improvement idk how it will be in real life But nice features with focal lenses etc direct external storage recording and spatial video which needs to be tasted
Oh and 40 min Great acting on how much naturefriendly we are with only actually NEW phone for 1000 
And It was so funny when they said that the new 800 iPhone is 4x worse than the new 1000 Pro in chip and ray tracing"
We finally got usbc great But where is the fast charging actually tripped at the finish line
with USBC and sideloading on the way iPhones might actually become usable
What are the storage amount and prices
Now as a samaung user i no longer have to hear Do u have an iPhone charger
Did they save usb c for a nothingburger year 
"Summary

Iphone 15  iphone 14 pro
Iphone 16  iphone 15 pro
Iphone 17  iphone 16pro

Okay"
Theres an easy way to be excited about the new iPhone  when youre still using the 11 Pro Max like I do 
Is the action button clickable or solid state with haptic feedback
I love how you dont mess around and give honest reviews when saying not much has changed im currently using the 14 pro max this is the only year i wont be upgrading the changes made will have zero impact for me also the new type c port dosent feel as sturdy and solid as the old lightning
Camp dont care at all here Honestly USB C in 2023 are you kidding me
I feel like only the iphone 15 promax would be a good upgrade for the latest generation
So the biggest thing about the new iPhone is the usb c which Apple were forced to implement lmao And people will still line up for this ps and pay 2000
252 bezels still huge
No fast charging in 2023 Wow
Literally The Same Phone xD 
Such a fanboy 
its a big upgrade because now it has usb c
Love the thumbnail wallpaper 
I just want someone to connect old iphone with a lightning to C cable to the new one
Was there any chatter about EU requiring phone makers to make batteries userreplaceable
"Apples really making it stupidly annoying to just want a base iPhone instead of the pro for 200 more 
You dont get the new chip 
Youre stuck at usb 20 data speeds which is the same as the lightnings basically
I think the brand is dumb but hey who am I



Seriously who am i i forgot"
I mean iphones just all look exactly the same they just dont innovate like samsung There ecosystem built in voicemail and FaceTime are great but thats about it I used to be a big iphone person till i switched to samsung now i cant go back
Wow it is just like the the last 2 but with the smallest tweaks Boring as hell as per usual from Apple
Was so happy when I saw you being quoted in the Apple event you are a great inspiration to many of us and thanx for giving us the best tech content I have never owned an apple product coz in my country they are just so expensive especially the new ones For example the Iphone 15 is Ugx 2974962 or more Thats my tuition for a full year with a few notes to spare  as for the pro max thats tuition for two years so lets wait till I start working maybe thats when I can afford as for now I have just started university this being my first year and semester But regardless I watch your videos coz they give me the close up experience I am not able to get Thank you You are the best
I see your GFX1002 David
Down with lightning
We want The Studio reaction video on this Apple Event plsss
You look so disappointed man but weve known this for months
I cant wait till they dont come with chargers and everyone has to ask us Android users for our chargers and after the flak weve gotten from lightning users I dont think most of us are gonna give the sympathy 
Love you but boooo Anker
Uh the 48MP camera moving to the standard iPhone is kind of insane My 14 Pro vaporizes every other iPhone out there and moving that to the standard iPhone kind of shocks me
"Is no tech YouTuber going to be honest and just call this how they see it 
An iPhone 14 Pro in a new body and a USB C port"
"Pro Max Plus Ultra This is getting confusing 
If there is no USB OTG file manager and keyboard swiping for more languages this will still be only an expensive Kardashian selfi phone"
Honestly I would have titled this video as iPhone 15a stagnation of Apple This by far has been the most underwhelming launch by Apple in years There is nothing to be excited about except the new material and USBC I am sure a trillion dollar company at this point can start taking some risks and give people something more to care about Just skip this generation and wait for the iPhone 16 because as of now Apple seems to have lost their path
iPhone 15 and still no astrophotography mode
In thumbnail u literally look like miles Somerville 
Same display same puch hole camara only upgrade but single image cannot explainfullynow mkbhd is best awesam more morebut activaly now 15 pro is 14 pro plus only
Next generation portrait has been on Pixel for ages It should be called last generation
it built  so good but they need to upgrade back design
Welp I guess my X gonna have to last till the iphone 16
Im definitely preordering and getting one right away
tired of 900 iphones with 60hz and the same chassis  apple gotta be stopped
The new update is a yawner thats for sure The only interesting thing going on in phones these days is the foldables and thats only on the Android side Apple is too busy making  from its iMessages monopoly to bother with innovation
Did Apple tell you not to mention why theyre forced to switching to USBC
I still have the 12 but I need to upgrade my memory anyway so thatll be the only way I upgrade
Looks same boring
Does iPhone 15 and 15 plus have pro motion display
He definitely has the phone already
"I have been waiting for your review 
Thank you "
"543 
When people ask for practice things Apple would offer but with constraints "
200k views in 25mins  
Ive been waiting all day for this
200k in 30 mins jesus
I bought the 14pro about 6 months ago Should I upgrade
"This year they made the regular iphone even more degraded and presented it like its for the poor people
iphone 15 is made of fiber glass just like 14 12 and 13 series were made of Aluminium
They come in ugly cheap childish light colors The screen refresh rate is probably still 60hz
And they made up some new bs All day battery instead of showing the real battery lifetime Lame

And they even cheaped out on the USBC iphone 15 comes with USBC USB2 speeds and iphone 15 pro comes with USBC USB3 support with 20x speed haha

AND no good looking Gold colors on the PROs No thanks Let the regular sheep cult fanboys buy it
iphone 12 and 13 series will survive for many more years Keep them"
They did not implement fast charging for now so that they can implement it to their future phones
ASHEEPS
Im glad you remember flying there 
Accessories is the only reason I am going to wait to upgrade It is extremely convenient to travel with one cable and one power brick
it not an upgrade for my pixel 7 pro Or is it
He missed the features I thought was cool and it was the gaming and spatial video for AVP Im also very curious how much RAM these phones will have either 6 or 8 GBs since nobody knows and if they will be locked by storage size
Nothing about dynamic island coming to the baseline iPhone 15 
So nothing new 
Yeah looks like Apple is either purposely kneecapping the USBC iPhone just to warm the consumer up for a noport iPhone on the next generation or theyre saving the fast charge and high throughput features for the next gen
"The only good feature USBC was enforced by EU law so its not even Apples innovation

Also I remember when the 350 Pixel 6a got a lot of critic for not supporting 90Hz or 120Hz and the iphone 15 still has 60hz and no one cares"
I think it should be mandatory to add a small thanks you note to the EU every time anyone talks about USBC on this lineup Lets DEFINITELY not forget who made Apple crack
Might be changing to 15 pro max from my iPhone 11 pro max  this the time now 
omg early
You forgot to talk about the 2x telephoto of i phone 15 I felt like its one of the best upgrade ever i phone made in non pro models
No fast charging and usb 2 in 2023 is just down right disgusting
my main question is  if I have a iPhone 13 Pro Max is this the year to upgrade
I think its just petty how apple implemented USBC on the new Phones USB 2 Speeds and no fastcharging They almost act like a child who does it halfassed out of spite because it was forced to do something it doesnt want to do lol
"Broke gang
"
Andrews message on the thumbnail 
Its funny most androids are still 20 with type c so no big deal for most people
The tactile mute switch will be dearly missed
Your shirt looks like the Autotrader UK logo
They have truly ran out of ideas SMH
iPhone 15 is repacked last year pro model yea not the refresh rate tho 
Jual ginjal lu
Some are great Some are more like overdue 
OK so its the same phone again but at least it has new colors I mean its the only thing the mass users of apple products care about
My upgrade 12 white 128gb to 15 blue 256gb 
I really hate how apple treats people like sheep
Wow amazing it looks just like the previous three models Boring
Finally apple let their stubborness go and adapt to USB C
Who else was waiting for this guy to do this video  I feel like other people will be lying
So i need some suggestions Before i was considering buying an iPhone 14 plus and now with this Iphone 15 lineup i am a little bit confused So should i go for an Iphone 14 plus or Iphone 14 pro or Iphone 15 plus or iphone 15 pro UGHHHHH I HATE THIS Switching first time to IOS
Still waiting for pixel 8 pro October the fourth
iPhone is more like a Nothing now nicee
Also they skipped the USBC adapter to ear Pods in the box 
It clearly shows it doesnt cost apple 100 for storage upgrade xd
and apple strikes again they made a phone that has USB C but none of the benefits of USB C
So the phone is same same but different
USBC I think is more important than you might think since file transfers are MUCH faster than lightning And its unfortunate that the speed is still USB 20 on the nonpro They definitely could of gone to USB 3
Love the titanium finish But other than that Im not sold on upgrading from 14 pro
Damn Ive never been this early
We was waiting
Skippable phone I still have the 12 Pro max I didnt get the 13 pro max because while the screen upgrade was wild theres no need to upgrade every single year I didnt buy the 14 pro max because we all knew that apple was being bullied into USB C for the 15 so i wasnt about to upgrade to a phone right before a refresh And im not buying the 15 Pro max because asside from the button and usb C its a pretty mid upgrade Ive heard rumors that apple might skip a release in 2024 i dont remember where i heard that but regardless im getting a 16 series if its announced If we dont get an iphone next year then ill just buy the spring midcycle color when that gets released Hopefully its a fun color and not another round of pastel
"Im going to wait for the iphone 15bro option
Thats a 15pro in beaten up condition and no warranty with 50 off"
"It is fascinating to realize that essentially Apples biggest innovation this year the introduction of USBC wasnt even their own idea but enforced by the European Commission
I guess Apples marketing department actually deserved most praise during this Apple Event"
D days hv come down fr apple to copy from OnePlus about d iconic switch Surreal
These upgrades feel unexceptional to me Nothing compelling Wed all worked around the slow lighting cable issue with Airdrop for videos and pics so that doesnt really matter For all the fuss made out of the 3 nm architecture I wouldve expected better performance I am interested to see that new zoom in action though
do you know why they didnt update usbc to iphone se is it going to be discontinued
Marques say it if there is nothing new why making it complecated sounding not so gud these like typical review any way
The action button should be a shutter button with a satisfying click
Tim Cook name dropping you at an Apple presentation is your canon event
What is USB C 
People from 2013 wouldnt have guessed that usb c will be huge news in 2023
i found it so funny watching the iphone 15 and 15 plus reveal in the beginning and just being like i already have all this in my 14 pro i find it interesting how they didnt drop the prices of it either probably cause people would just go for the 14 pro instead
Ive been patiently waiting for this 
A17 pro
My current iphone is having troubles with batterie and overheating so i think ill upgrade anyways besides usb c is a thing i wantetd for a long time in an iphone
USB Finally one reason less to hate Apple Baby step towards the customers tho it does count Better late than never Good move Apple
Still rocking an 11 pro max and Im kinda glad I waited until this version to upgrade
If you map the action button to camera for example  then how do silent the phone
Ive been impatiently waiting for this video 
iPhone is the Madden of all phones  its not just a roster update  stfu
I am in the camp of Android baby 
"I have a regular iPhone 12 now and was thinking about upgradeing to the 15 plus
But the lack of always on display on it is disappointing to be honest
In my opinion a phone that expensive should have that  as standard"
Still no 120 hz display on the base model 
643 They wouldve if they werent forced to switch to USBC
The base 15 is the best option now
did u bleach your palms like wtf
Was going to buy AirPods 3 with usbc case Alas they only bring usbc to the AirPods Pro 2 Meanwhile give a 30 minute CSR presentation and how sustainable they are
The USB C cable will cost you extra 
Marques just skipped AAA gaming on an iPhone like its nothing
I dont remember the video maybe some oneplus phone video where you said that i dont see apple ditching mute switch for a very long time atleast a decade or something
That action button UI reminds me of an Android smartphone companys UI where they havent even released a phone but claimed a lot for their software I couldnt remember that company name
This is the first time since the iPhone 5C that Im planning on purchasing an iPhone Ive had androids pretty much most of my life and the main dealbreaker for me was the iPhone not having USBC among other things The 15 Pro seems very promising and Im just tired of the look and feel of android texting A welcome change
This is the review and the reviewer thay Ive been waiting
Its just the same old phone with new colors
Kk Battery refresh on 12pro for me
2am bro
Apple didnt switch to USBC outta the goodness of their hearts its only thanks to European Union legislation that demanded all EUsold iphones should have usb c  From an american thank you EU
Was waiting for your video
The USBC supports DisplayPort Out On the Pros you can game on a big flat screen TV
Ill be getting a pro modelIm still using an XR so its time for an upgrade
Love the point about titanium vs stainless steel isnt that big of a difference in terms of strength I also really dont like the pastelley colored 15s predicting there will be a less neutral colored pro in the midcycle 
Thank you MK God bless You
One thing I noticed unless I missed it cause truth be told I did doze off for a few minutes of this thing  but they didnt mention anything regarding battery improvements so thats of course one of the key things I look forward to seeing in your review Marques Keep doing the great work you do
The best thing about the new iPhones releasing has to be the fact the actually interesting future charging accessories that dont focus on MagSafe will now work with all other phones by default
I dont even use apple but literally just add another hole down there 
Great review and what an honor today
My main problem is with my air pods pro they are my only accessory with lightning  this is super annoying
Dont worry about android being able to borrow apple cable   its always other way around iPhone users looking for compatible cable as they cant use the universal type c cable
In the camp Dont care at all
They are finally realising their weakness 
I loved the shoutout Tim Cook gave to you
everything else had USB type C MORE THAN A COUPLE OF YEARS
Im in the Im going to wait and watch the reviews camp
Here we go lets see how my 14 pro max is useless
You know you are old when the next iPhone is not interesting to you
We early
Is it worth to switch from the 14 pro max
As a iPhone 14 Pro Max owner the 15 is a skip for me Just not enough to warrant the cost I recon I will be keen to upgrade by the time the 16 rolls around
Kinda interested to see what usbc accessories come about that i can use on my Samsung lol
Homie was quoted in the Apple Event Too bad the new phones are not impressive
Apple talk about that they care environment so much but they cant make a battery which last for 1 full day
so its an iPhone 14s
60hz for non pro device is criminal
Same shit except usb c im good with my 13 pro
More than usb c  copium
Im going to miss the lightning cable Its so low profile and subtle Strong Im worried the usbc internals will snap and fail
Ive never liked the usbc I feel like the week point is in my device I wish the female end was in the device I feel like the ports will fail more often than lightning Should have made it modular Can pick which you want haha
Irony is getting a Samsung z flip ad on this video 
Only watching to se if i made a mistake buying the 14 pro last year instead of waiting Seems like i didnt D
new pros are nice im sticking with my 13 pro for at least another 2 gens tho
How long are they going to use a decade old 60hz display No one asked for the dynamic island on the 15 Also no charging speeds mentioned in both the models meaning theyll be as usual painfully slow
They needs to put 4 cameras n AirPods colors and have camera on Apple Watch
At this point we expect Iphone to be good in everything if not it will be next year price will be high for some of usetc The fact that you work really hard to entertain us is much appreciated
bros video quality is immaculate
Still have my iPhone 11
Thank you EU for forcing Apple to finally use USBC on their hardware worldwide 
So what are you sticking to pro or pro max this year
iPhone 15 Pro Max I cant wait to buy it for gaming like me I love trying a new thing especially for mobile gaming
Thank you for the video Marcus top quality as usual My sister and her husband will be rushing right out to buy the newest Iphone they do every year thats 7 people at 1100 each ill stick with my S21 ultra 1300 for it new back then was enough maybe in a few years ill switch upmaybe
Its a usb C U get to charge your iPhone ipad airpods with just one cable What a novelty
Will go pro max this time
I seriously  think able lovers need a repair 
Imagine at the end of the live stream they said one more thingand unveiled the apple foldable 
"I was waiting for your video about 15
Thanks"
Im getting a 15 Pro for free in TMobile with 13 Pro Max trade in why not 
Bro Tim Cook shoutout to you today Way to go man
Its the same phone
That Goatee lookin good on you man 
Congratulations Apple Im embracing USBC Now your products suck a little bit less
your videos are so good and so well edited Great work 
Is 722 some sort of easter egg 
They are all boring  this one was the most boring
Best iPhone impressions video and I havent even watch it
The fact that Apple keep saying innovative frequently make me crack 
Apple announced the 14 series lineup with USBC
Gona see if att give me good trade in on my old spare 12 pro hopefully 1000 credit and Ill get 15 pro max 1tb
The next nothing thing for the slavescustomersconsumers Sorry NOT
"Customizable key
USB type C
 thats transformation into one hardware phone
Not its war of softwares"
THERE IS MY REAL APPLE EVENT UNLESS MARQUES UPLOADS IT JUST AINT REAL lmao thanks 
Titanium is NOT stronger than stainless steel its just lighter
I was so happy when they used his review in keynote 
The battery gotta b crazy
is it magasfe compatible
Have you ever shattered one of your daily driver phones dropping it
its honestly borring looking like blackberry
EU forced them to change it to USBC
6 different models and no mini
Thunderbolt on iPhone expect that in 2030 as a ground breaking feature
Everyone watch out for dirty thieving Apple owners stealing our charging cables
These videos keep getting better and better Keep up the good work
I wonder why it was lacklustre 
Looking forward to the phone regardless finally upgrading from my 2020 SE to an actual flagship for the first time ever lol
Its funny to imagine all the apple people waiting for this single event hoping for something of juicy to come but then find out there is not so much and part of thisnot so much is action button something that someone in the world has already explored
time to wash your watch band
Roll on friday when I can order one nothing else to say  Action button is great because Im left handed and its the thumb spot for me
Id love to see the Pro Max pitted against the Sony RX100 now that the Max covers 13120mm equivalent focal lengths
I feel like this USBC thing is a prank but its not April
MKBHD the 
Another paid apple sponsored videoif it was an android devicehe might have used a totally different languagelike samsung has settledusb C a cool featureseriously mkbhd
Apple usbc cable cost
"I am so interested in the iPhone 15
I dont care for the Pros"
Im surprised that they didnt make it seem like USBC was the groundbreaking upgrade for the 15s haha
I dont know what else they can possibly add to the phone
10 Minutes after the Keynote I ordered a refurbished iPhone 13 mini The prices are insane and Im still pissed that they killed the only small iPhone
"waste of money 
mine works still better
no need of wasting my money"
Cool video for a boring phone
If they only came out with a usbc mini iphone I dont like the regular iphone size or the max size because theyre too chunky and fat I prefer a discrete mini iphone
We make minor changes you give us moolah Capiche Tim Cook
These zoomins and zoomouts are getting a little  annoying TBH Especially zoomins when a certain pointpunch line is being made  as if the audience needs the zoom in to get the point Example 508
The USBc seems like it will be harder to clean from pocket lint Also expect all the calls from relatives trying to shove a ligtning cable up that thing
Lost interest in in the iPhone but watched for MKBHDs take on it 
Pixel
15 looks curved screen Or it is flat as before
"Really not a much wow factor
The standard 15 and 15 Plus with munted 480mbps USB2 speed
I used to upgrade every 2 years till 13 Pro Max and cant see a reason to upgrade maybe 16 or 17"
Coming from years of android having a usbc  iphone might be what I needed to switch I just need to understand how easy it is ti transfer files from iphone to windows
Unbelievable I still have the IPhone 12 Pro and theres still not much thats convinced me to upgrade  Im disappointed I was looking forward on upgrading too
Looking forward to replacing my 12 with this Nice review
All these new camera features like the magic eraser changing focus action mode cinematic mode etc were introduced by the NOKIA Lumia 925 10 years ago
Been waiting for your review
Usbc by force
Maybe maybe can we use the USBC to a monitor and have a DEX like desktop OS ie MacOS lite
I want to buy this soon 
New IPhone
Thank you EU for gifting us with USBC
Samsung ad on start of this video hmmmm great start of video
iPhone 14 Pro Max club here
"Hey Marques thanks for astonishing recap of the iPhone 15
After 3 nanometer you think there will be a 2 nm chip What are the limits"
Casually showing off the GFX100 II I see 
My Iphone 14 pro still is good  there is not much changed to make me excited to buy 15 at this moment  Will wait for 16 pro
Tim mentioned your name bro kudos you are going far
They cant use thunderbolt to show the world how shitty the lightning was
Its ridiculous how Apple didnt bother to capitalize on USBC implementation and lead by example No real use of the USBC they put out Pretty cocky too on their part not to include fast charging too I feel Ah well theyll still sell truck loads of these 
If the iPhone 15 can get the next generation portraits with the same processor and main camera lens as the iPhone 14 pro Why cant they bring the same to the iPhone 14 pros I mean they cant say the new processor makes this possible as its quite literally the same as the 14 pro
Probs for MKBHD that he made a 13 minute video about the most minor of phone updates in the history of phone updates
Apple should add the same action button functionality to power button double click Why its only siripay there Using power button to launch the camera will be much more convenient rather than using action button
Congrats on the mention in the first 5 mins of the presentation mkbhd
Waiting for October
All you guys wanted was to switch to usbc they dont have to make it faster or thunderbolt or anything else Stop complaining
The Most Interesting Thing is AV1 and ProRES codecs HW Acceleration And Also The Fact That You Can Record Video Using iPhone Directly to An External Storage is just lit
The iPhone 15 The same as the iPhone 14 which was the same as the iPhone 13 Which was the same asyou get the picture
there is iphone 15 gigantic pro max and there is HUAWEI P60 PRO
Ill be honest fast charging kills batteries so im fine with the current charging state
Studio vlog coming soon 
If they didnt give even 90Hz in base models the least they couldve done is reduce the prices to 500600 because at 800 if you dont provide promotion or 90Hz display in 2023 its an outrage
first
Jeez im gonna get samsung flip or s23 u its sad how all iPhone looks same boring   My buddy at gym asked me if my iPhone 12 Pro is 15 pro because i didnt have case on 
Worth waiting for the next iphone
Camp not caring at all all lightning model resale values are going to poop this year
Im about to move out of the country to Japan and Im thinking about getting an iPhone to replace my android Do you think iPhones work better out of the states or does it not really matter
Really disappointed that the 5x is only available for the max 
Im hearing a lot of buts to justify apples decisions  but when samsung or google reuse things you bash them hard Your biase is showing hard
"MARQUES BROWNLEE 

LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
USB C being pretty much the only wire necessary is great
soooo Ive been holding onto my iphone 8 plus hoping apple would bring back a touch ID Its been fine all these years but its starting to show its age Ill be getting a 15 pro max Should be a huge upgrade
WTFNo 60HZ in Non  Pro Models  WTF APPLE this is 2023 and still  60HZ and 700 price point
Before the Event I was fully prepared to swap my 12 Pro for a 15 Pro Now I dont know Maybe Ill just wait and see what the 16 offers next year The 15 doesnt really do anything my 12 couldnt do And Im not giving up on pacific blue and spending hundreds of dollars on a glorified USBport
I have a Xs and its on its last legs  like it heats up when I facetime someone so looking to maybe get a 15 the action button seems cool i guess
Honestly when we getting a new SE phone
The only reviewer of tech on YouTube that I trust  Thanks for the upload
I think theyre purposely keeping slow charging so that if the iPhone does ever go completely wireless the charging speed would be the same
Thumbnail wallpaper link
The action button should have been the power button where you can customize it with one tap double tap triple tab or a long press 
The action button is not so new stuff
Im paying VERY VERY close attention to this phone The last iPhone I had was the iPhone4 Ever since then Ive been an Android user and i have the pixel 4a right now Im sure whatever i get will be a significant upgrade but I feel like i cannot call myself a tech guy if i dont go experience the other side once in a while and see what its like yknow
Selling 60Hz phone for 899 is robbery and being tech Youtuber you should have pointed out to consumers how they are getting robbed
Im still using the iPhone 11 Maybe its time for me to upgrade
Am buying it anyone which is colour variant for pro max
14 pro max on sale vs 15 pro max hmmmmmmmmmm
Bruh what took You so long
If I was a filmmaking astronaut maybe I would be interested in the Pro Im good with my Pixel
I cant afford the pro phones but I want that USB 3 SPEEDSSSSSS
Finally I can go a bar and meet a random girl and wake up at her house she has the same charger as me All these years I wake up and my phone is almost dead and Im trying to Uber home on 3 battery life at 5Am7AM
Oeh
I would recommend to just completely disregard the regular iphone 15 and 15 plus Cant believe a smartphone in 2023 costing 800 and 900 usd dont have usb 20 and 120 hz display not even surprised sadly
How did you miss the part where he said using the extra space in the pro model for the new lens and get the back glass part
Pretty boring release But a good upgrade for my wifes X
The pro costs 300 usd more in europe than in the us
The cushions and ID color coordination at the background is DOPE
So basically what Im getting is that its the same phonebut usbc remarkable Im absolutely impressed at how apple consistently does this every year
There is a fast charging but not today saving it for next year or so
the only highlight of that event is the usb c and the new icloud expendables storage
That UI for the Action button though 
What an extremely underwhelming phone announcement yeah its better on paper but wow zero innovation and insultingly lazy for the average consumer
ohh a new color I will wait in line for 8 hours
The pink color is something we needed a long time ago
"Camp like totally getting one of these
The camera and lighter weight of the pro max
Action button will be my homes light switch via shortcuts"
Are you serious iPhone 15 with an old processor same 60Hz display and a pretty slow USB Type C Are people really excited about this crap I cant believe it
Cant they just make a normal black phone why does it always have a shade of blue 
23th  iPhone already damn i feel like an old man
Longterm android user here I am converting to the apple ecosystem to give it another shot Previously had iPhone 7 Plus and I hated it But I got a M2 Mac and AirPods Pro 2 and I plan on preordering the iPhone 15 Pro Max this Friday Finally couldnt stand the lower battery life windows laptops hearing about how great the AirPods are they are great tbh and regretting my purchase of a Z Flip 4 these Flip phones dont inspire long term confidence so this plus Apple embracing USB C on iPhone was the perfect storm
Im just here to watch it how it look
So wait theres a new larger sensor for 48mp sensor on the pro models I thought it was the same sensor as 14pro
So how do you mute and unmute the phone if you have the button mapped to something else
I am in camp I hate Apple more and more Its a miracle that they can sell this like a hot potato
S23 Ultra is still the better phone by a mile 24 Ultra will hit it out of the park
I just wanna know if the pro max is worth it or not this year Like is the only difference the 5x zoom vs the regular pro
recording straight to ssd will be GREAT
Was Waiting For Your Video
What is this audio
Watching this 144p love it
How much should be the Chargers power  in Watt for pro models 
Im just waiting for a foldable iPhone at this point
It seems to me only reviewed a device as entertainment unit not a phone All I encounter with a iphone and want apple to impvoe is the better receiving carriers signal quality for the past few generations I had stop upgrade my phone on ip12 due to I found there is no improvements on ip13 and ip14 as a phone But up until now no one and even with one of the best youtubers Marques to review a proper iphone if the device still belongs to phone category
Great video as always but how could they add usb c and only make it usb 20  like usb 30 is about to be replaced with usb 4 and apple just went usb 20 in 2023 
"My sister had a kid when USBC was invented That child is NINE now Apple are slow and them augmenting USBC to USB2 speeds is so typical 
Good luck sheeple"
Whats that scraping the barrel noise apple
Im waiting to see how good the Iphone 15 pro max for Filmmaking
"Fast charge
Not so bad but apple says we dont do it until we can do it  apple way"
Anker
Apple used him for advertising their products and yall are creaming your pants
I am an iphone user But I think its ridiculous how apple pandered being environmentally friendly their whole event and yet its still damn near and probably will continue to affordably repair these stupid phones
I already have the 14 pro max and I know I dont need to upgrade but I really want to upgrade to the 15 pro max the 5x optical zoom would be a game changer for me
Dont buy apple products wtf
Cant  believe Marques loves a  Bixby button
Who cant afford even iphone 11 anx the pro
Looks to me that the space black doesnt look as nice as last year Pls examine it in the review
The crappiest upgrade ever
Congrats on being mentioned in the keynote Incredible to see how much respect you gained in the whole tech industry Keep it up
The shoutout from Tim Apple though Congrats man 
So does the action button have click long click and double click assignment options
Need a iphone very badly my oneplus has green line issue facing so many problems need a iphone 15
The refresh rate of the display on the regular iPhone has not changed right
Titanium
Wouldnt mind someone gifting me an iPhone 15pro come October 25th next month as my birthday gift
iPhone 15 is crazy bruh frfr
Lets C
739 Glass is glass and it breaks 
For those so eager to upgrade their already recent phone I waited 9 iterations to upgrade my IPhone 6 so patience  less high tech trash dumped somewhere Not easy but necessary to remind that we are the source of massive pollution if we do not take steps like being more patient when renewing our phones
its still the same phone   zero innovation can they make a phone dat looks new
After this disappointing release Im excited to go back to Galaxy
I dont care about usbc or the action button  Im all about the titanium housing and telescopic lenses I wont be getting the 15 pro anyway I have 1yr left on my 14 pro contract but Ill be getting 16 pro or pro max 100
In my opinion the 13 is just a steal now Basically the same phone if you can get over the usb c and the one year older chip set for way cheap 
Man its really amazing about your content Youre like the LeBron of youtube
Soo its the same junk with USB C and its double the price
So let me get this straight A plus sized iPhone 15 in 2023 that cost 900 has USB 20 a 60hz display and no fast charging For 900 Never change Apple
Bro pls show what color is ur iphone 15 pro max in ur pocket
yep so youve been quoted by Timmy two weeks ago here the review
Looking forward to the AAA Games on iPhone This will be an exciting addition to mobile gaming The processor upgrades are way more meaningful now
Are there still apple certified accessories
I was wondering why its showing 360p  I thought my iPhone already degraded 
Im still using my old iPhone Xs Max So this upgrade is more than worth it to me
Great vid cannot wait to listen to your review 
I was so bored of the video not becoz of Marques but becoz of Apple bringing the same shit again and again that I skipped a major chunk of it and still gonna buy this shit
Still iphone 13  13 pro max are the best mobile 
Watching on my iPad mini 3 Lols Lols TT
MKBHD the goat 
Ive been waiting for usdc for 3 years now Im finally switching to Iphone
cant wait to preorder lol
I need to know am I the only one disappointed that we now have a charging port with a breakable male piece inside again I feel like were moving backwards
They had to change the port for the European market New laws coming out
I predict that apple will increase the data transfer rate and faster charging on the iPhone 16 Pro Series next year
USBC is enough to want to upgrade from my 14 Pro I knew I should have held out one more year
"Youtube How high quality do you want an Apple first impressions video on release day to be

MKBHD Yes"
My favorite part of the keynote was when Tim Cook name dropped you
Waiting to see if th upgrade from my 13 Pro Max is worth it USBC is a big candidate but not Shute about the rest
MKBHD looks newer than before than the new iPhone 
TBH the biggest highlight is Apples dedication to carbon neutral and the best way to support them i guess is to NOT BUY ANY IPHONE from this year
"509
The ONLY reason they did that was so they could add it next year and claim the 15 has a new feature"
12x focal length is 28mm 13x is 35mm Which simulates the same field of view as some full frame cameras
I would suggest to skip to iphone 16
799 its unbelievable  in 2023 and still 60Hrz display but we have a great thing  10 year old connector is finally available on iphone  what an innovation
Titanium isnt stronger than steel though Its lighter It lets the phone be lighter for the same strength maybe even a little less strength
lets gooooo
"It needs to be noted that the 14 pro and 15 pro have a larger 48 megapixel sensor compared to the 15 and 15 
Have a look at the pixel size on the 15 it is two microns whereas the 14 pro its 244 

There is also a difference between the apertures 
The 15  15 plus have a faster f 16 aperture while the 14 and 15 pro use a f 178 aperture I imagine the slower aperture is offset by the larger sensor found in the pro 

It looks like the 14 pro and 15 pro are using the same sensors  except for the pro max telephoto which has a 25 larger sensor 

And it looks like the ultra wide gets a better coating for lens flare compensation 

Everything else is software related Smart hdr 5 and the extra focal lengths appear to be all enabled by software"
After the Apple event from yesterday I was waiting for this video to come out to say this since MKBHD is now officially on Apples payroll I believe he lost all credibility on all videos recent and future relating to their products OR products of their competitors
I still cant quite use one cable to charge everything because of some other things and even if they somehow update the ports on AirPods its an expensive price to pay for this convenience 1323
the whole portrait mode thing has been on android for 5 years now nothing about iphone is ground breaking at all
Ehhh Ill stick with my 14 Pro
Wheres the 15 ultra
He is the best reviewer We addict to his videos  Lets get iphone 15 pro max
Who came here from tiktok 
010 damn marques really handsome
900 Now that there is no switch is there a silent mode icon  in the status bar to notify you of the silent mode status and remind you to turn it off to avoid missing calls
Youre not going to mention the shoutout you got
Minor improvement
40gbsec
Seems like apple just keeps adding features that have been on every android phone for years and asks ppl to pay more money for it and still being cheap and giving the 15 and 15 plus 60hz screens in 2023 is just stupid
Reason they dont wanna enhance the feature of USBC is because Apple is still salty that EU forced them to switch instead of them naturally switching Also action button that Samsung been using  for years now Bixby Button  but tech YouTube for some reason thinks its revolutionary
Ngl I gasped audible when I saw your testimonial being featured in the Keynote along with iJustine
Over the years intentionally make a phone hard to repair and then when you get called out for it Make the change now and claim it as repair friendly Oh apple
Thank youuu for this video and so proud of you too
This gives them an upgrade path for next years phones where they add thunderboltusb 4 and faster charging
Yea I am totally to get it well at least try
Yeah but USBC Light a button instead of toggle Im definitely looking at this as 145 Once they started going on and on and how recyclable it was I realised it was cover blurb for a lack of features
The only things that make this new iPhone line up look new are the new colors for the regulars iPhone 15s and the USB C for the phones only major changes  is it worth it to upgrade
Upgrading from 6sPlus so looking forward to this
The Special Button Is effectively what you have been able to do with Androids by doubletriple tapping the side power button
Hurrai lightning is gone
Silly MQBHD you should know by now that Apple will always leave a feature out for 3 4 or 5 years after android has already done it  Then sell it as a new product  Theyll probably remove the usbc port  when they can get 50 watt wireless charging
MKB360P I was really early 
Ok hear me out what if the action button ends up being a shutter button for the camera Short press to focus and long press to click the photo the position is convenient to be used as a shutter button and it would make taking photos so much more fun and convenient 
no more mini phones huh
Honestly love the content and everything you guys do obviously its not just you but as the ring master I must say congratulations as for the phone I think next year they might up the anti after collecting some usb c apple user data to see where features would be most desirable lightningfast chargingdifferent connectivity options
14 minutes since upload  101k views  Marques killing it
is it smart for me to update from a 12 pro max i love my phone but im also looking for a new feeling should i just wait for the 16 for a bigger change
Did you really say heres a lens to look at this through then show the 15s camera lenses Thats absolutely comedy gold
Type C
No big change at all 
Butthat was just what they already told Wheres YOUR impressions
"Thanks for the great video as always Love your content
One thing you didnt mention is the spatial video recording i know you really disliked the part of the vision pro presentation because you were saying that recording a memory with the helmet on was a weird thing and ruining the moment I was really really hoping for this feature on the iphone to eliminate this issue and just record as usual with the phone but be able to relieve it in an immersive way later
To each their own many dont wantneed it  i am happy and will upgrade my 12 max pro to the 15 max pro And buy the vision pro asap"
Its embarrassing that apple refuses to give the standard model a higher refresh rate I would even be happy if they just bumped the base up to 90hz and left 120 for the pros but the fact that phones a third of the price of iPhone have twice the refresh rate of the base model gets more frustrating every year Overall though I like the new phones they seem all around good Im just so tired of feeling left behind by apple
Funny is that the USB C was required here in Europe by EU regulations but Apple does as if that was no reason whatsoever 
15 mins late 
Honestly I dont care at all Lol
usb c with a bunch of new gimmicks basically
So sim card slotno way Makes this phone incredibly annoying for international travel Apple simply doest not want me to buy their products I was waiting for usb c to give i phone a try But with no sim slot Its completely out of tge question
112  I think that was a voice crack
Watched Aruns video 8 minutes after it was released Warned MKBHDs video 15 minutes after it was released
One question  is it better than S23 ultra  Is there any game or app which shows significant difference between both
Is it just me who thinks that the coolest new feature is the hardware ray tracing on the new pro phone 
For me the headliner is the A17 Pro The GPU changes improved neural engine and hardware AV1 support are super exciting Particularly when you think about how it will be scaled up for the M3 chips
Totally interested in 15pro But no money 
I guess you mentioned in a video that Apple might not comply with EU regulations and switch new iPhones to Bluetooth charging
How did apple say about usb c We have made a new best port 
Waiting for the giveaway 
"This is the comment that got me  

All new phones have USBC and the new pro models take usbc to the next level

Apple  usb 3 10 gig  has been around for a literal decade Its not next level"
Meh I guess I wont upgrade from 14 pro just for that type c And also I like this deep purple color more than the new one 
Not interested in iPhone 15 they are not putting thier efforts
"Wow this new USB interface created by Apple is gonna be a gamechanger 
Wonder when the rest of the industry will catch on"
You didnt talk about the log video format
Honestly other than USB C and dynamic island I dont see any difference between the 14 and 15camera quality matches that of the earlier Pro Max Models Besides with wireless charging who honestly cares about USB C Gonna stick with my 13 for at least a few years more
I cant imagine 20W charging in 2023 Its just awesome at this price Wow apple fixed the port issue thats revolutionary technology but gotta enjoy that silky smooth 60Hz you guys will love that The best ray tracing eva eva evaaa without any proper cooling VC Well vapor chamber is to be imagined for next years revolutionary slabs only This year enjoy the ray traced hotness Flat sides of last year was just the cherry on top for a proper in hand feel This year after denting all those users hands they took that cherry away probably flat edges for next year
No fast charging disgrace
That naturnal titanium color is looking mint Especially if you have the titanium watch ultra
You have to try so hard when you have to justify 60 htz in 2023  Still remember the samsung meme which says  Tell us when it folds
Im interested would you get one for me please
MKBHD got a shout out by Apple during the event  
Apple stopped innovating for the regular iphones
Will you be making a video on your opinions on the Apple Watch ultra 2
Heres a question On the old toggle switch You could easily see if the phone is silent without having to switch on the display or go into a menu That feature is lost with the action button
First i seen the video
Cant wait for the iPhone 17 and 18 
Rocking new GFX100II D
"Do u have to press and hold the action button for it to open an app or just press Because of its press and hold
I would say opening the phone normally is way faster"
Should I upgrade if I have a iPhone 13
I dont care at all
People are gonna start mapping the action button to a Siri Shortcut for the Google Assistant 
Gotta say the material is the biggest invite for me but coming from an iPhone 14 Pro Max I wasnt that blown away Quality video as always though 
All this but they still havent fixed phone spazzing out with the macro lens
S24 Ultra for the win
They said they updated the ceramic glass
Even tho the design is the same but i do kinda dig the titanium brush texture look on the pro models Its pretty clean and like sleek
Wow quality vid put together when the event ended less than 24 hours kudos 
The regular 15 models feel like what iph 14 pro already had except the USBC cable now 15 pro had some difference in material to titanium 5x camera lense  the action button replacing the muteunmute Pretty cool but the colors for pro are a bit dull
To conclude its the same thing We will still buy and complain about it tho 
Honestly they didnt change or add anything new lol
They did mention in the keynote that they used the extra space in the Pro Max to fit the fancy sensor in
fingerprint sensor 
Kinda underwhelming event
Apple fell off
But Samsung is the one that settled right 
Thanks for taking the opportunity Love your reviews
011  is this a money shot Is this supposed to make us fall in love with you looking at your eyes WELL IT GOD DAMN WORKED 
619 so disappointing
Watching this kinda discourages me buying the pro model I have a XR
Cant wait to use the iPhone 15 with an electric car 
Im still up Wassup yall
Look at these multimillionaire shills
Just another phone
So funny how people still buy iphones lol
Type c even if its slow is still an upgrade for people Less cable for us
Congratulations on getting featured in the presentation 
is ProMotion only on Pros
Im thinking about getting a 15 Pro  because my current phones a galaxy a13 and I want something faster to game etc but I also want a small phone without compromising battery or other stuff should I get the 15 pro or pro max
apple is boring
My IPhone 14 bro max Good battery
Best video before bed
"Dear Apple

It is with immense pleasure and a touch of whimsical nostalgia that I extend my heartfelt congratulations to you on your recent leap into the future with the adoption of USB TypeC charging technology In this thrilling era of 2023 your decision to embrace this revolutionary standard has undoubtedly propelled you into the hallowed halls of contemporary connectivity a realm that the techsavvy masses have been exploring since 2015

Oh what a journey it has been The world watched with bated breath as USB TypeC first emerged on the scene offering unparalleled versatility faster data transfer speeds and the longawaited dream of reversible connectors It was without a doubt a monumental stride towards simplifying our lives and untangling the web of cables that once ruled our gadgetcluttered drawers

And now here we stand eight years later as Apple takes its graceful step into this USB TypeC utopia The oncedistant future is now a reality and your users are rejoicing in the harmonious symphony of compatibility and convenience that this transition brings

Imagine the countless sighs of relief as your loyal customers bid farewell to the endless struggle of distinguishing between their chargers in the dark Picture the jubilation as they seamlessly connect their iPhones iPads and MacBooks to a single universal cable liberating themselves from the tyranny of adapter clutter

The world may have danced to the rhythm of TypeC for quite some time now but Apples arrival is like a crescendo in an orchestra harmonizing the symphony of technology and innovation Your commitment to this transition is a testament to your unwavering dedication to providing the best for your users even if it means catching up with the future that had already unfolded years ago

So dear Apple we applaud you for your embrace of USB TypeC and we do so with a standing ovation that spans the years from 2015 to 2023 May this step forward be a precursor to even greater leaps in the realm of technology and may your devices continue to bring joy and convenience to the lives of millions

With utmost admiration and respect
A Grateful Tech Enthusiast"
Ill stick with Android
Who else saw the tiktok of Marques and his big ass camera
Yippee
guess you forgot the non pro variants are still on 60Hz
I think when Apple cant think of any innovative tech features they should spend time on the durability of the device
Wait so no higher transfer speeds No USB PD fast charging What That is so far beyond disappointing Its absolutely baffling
Waited all day for this
Your name popping up in the first few minutes just left me with a proud smileWell deserved Marques 
I got here when he uploaded in 3 min And when I went to like the video it had jumped from 345 likes to 53k likes lol
Me trying to figure out why the fuck Apple needs 34 different versions of the same Iphone besides being greedy as fuck
Action button More like accidental button 
Samsung Ad came 
After Apple event  your reviews are the one the worlds waiting for
got here as fast as i could
Are you still telling people to subscribe Seriously 
"USB C is a utterly garbage standard
RIP
"
Oh my God the wait was excruciating For your review not the phone I had actually forgotten that it was today
He says you can now charge your friends Android phone like you dont have or can not have your own 
Usb c is the only new upgrade
A thousand comments in 11 minutes
Feels strange Ive been waiting for the USBC in iphone but now that it has it doesnt feel that exciting One main identity of Apple is controversy and it got rid of one here kind of
Apple shouldnt bother telling us about the design they should just say same old same old then move on
mrwhosetheboss got his review down first unlucky man
I saw your review first so send me the gift
better than Samsung Galaxy s23 ultra 
Wow 15 is completely different from 14
Not Just USBC   really  
You guys were up late burning the midnight oil editing appreciate all the hard work you guys do to bring us the latest and greatest content
What is new in this iPhone 
23rd iphone 
360p Gang Wya
So were already down to 3nm so are they just keep going and actually say like oh the new half nm chip kr the 18 nm chip 
Thanks to EU USBC Upcoming replaceable batteries and universal chargers for all gadgets
60 hz display in 2023 Apple never fails to disappoint me
Well ladys and gentlemen lets thank the EU for forcing the usbc on Apple products D
I LOVE IPHONE 15 AND MARQUES BROWNLEE 
nah its all about the USBc in my eyes
Congrats on becoming one of the biggest tech creators in the world
"People talking about strength Apple said 5x stronger TENSILE strength When the metal is being PULLED APART 

This enhancement they pointed out is entirely pointless in everyway An iPhone is never in a scenario where it is been pulled apart It is only every compressed through drops sitting on etc Its marketing nonsense"
Mkb but not hd
now Identifying fake iphones will be a little harder cus the fake ones have usb c too
I appreciate the quality of the video
Im early Holy waveform
The iPhone 14 had square edges just so the 15 could have rounded ones
Its crazy how long his content has been good for and he still keeps improving
I can tell youre not exited about the new iPhone
Solid changes S23 ultra still better
"The USB C port on the new iPhone15 support Display Port
Do you possibly think Apple could introduce Stage Manager for iphones Something to compete with Samsung Dex"
4K60 ProRes Log is nut
"Thanks to european union for forcing apple to type c 
Now RCS"
"Friendship ended with Lightning
Now USBC is my favorite connector"
we know why theyre doing ittt 
You know Marques made it when he gets recognized in big events glad they included your review Proud of your journey
USBC the apple way x
Its hilarious to me that my old Galaxy s5 from 2014 has USB 30 and after all this time Apple finally has it What the hell is going on with that This is like how the iPhone XR had a 900p screen in 2018 lol
Titanium is also for better thermals not just strengths it is important that those Pro chips are cooling correctly
I remember during the keynote they mentioned the 15 pro had slightly smaller dimensions can anyone confirm Update 715
If the iPhone 15 is using USB 20 speeds that would be a slap in the face I think it is USB 32 Gen 1 5 Gbps for iPhone 15 and USB 32 Gen 2 10 Gbps for iPhone 15 Pro
Been waiting on this
"Type C  
welcome to the tech world apple"
ok now this is epic
Now I dont have to carry an extra Lightning cable in my car for my Apple friends
For normal folks in the Apple ecosystem we already had 1 cable to charge all of our products and that was the Lightning cable Us non techies kinda dont care about USB C 
Im gonna set the action button to bixby 
Sponored review
Is it just me or Marquees was actually speaking in 125 x  at the start specially
A17 Pro next up A17 Ultra
I have been waiting for this video
They did a great job removing 128 GB storage option from their Pro Max I feel like 128 just isnt enough for phone thats capable of doing so much Knowing that I really dont mind the increase in price difference between the Pro and the Pro Max
This years biggest iPhone feature USBC by EU parlament 
It is just usbc
I was waiting for your video For me its a big change coming from Android phones for years It was about time Apple adopted USBC for good
I have a feeling that the reason they called it A17 Pro is that theyre gonna put an A17 chip in regular iPhone 16s
339 Im still annoyed theres no builtin manual focus
One thing that i liked about lightning port over USB C which also i never heard people talking about it that because USB C is a hollow port unlike lightning the connector can be bent which happened with my s21 cable Yeah thats pretty much the only thing i like about lightning
Its just the same stuff every year These are good if you are switching to iphone but there is no real reason upgrading to these
"Apple really spinning oh no only the pro phones have the USB 3 chip no way we could do that

And no fast charging Ugh Apple will keep milking the people who buy them"
Shout out to the EU for forcing Apple to change The upgrade doesnt really feel worth it this year maybe for a 3 year old phone USB C was long overdue but I dont think everyone is going to really need it Most changes are esthetics and cater to the creatives Its like they forgot about the every day user
Its more like an EU update
"Disappointment list
Thunderbolt 
Camera
Fast charging 
List goes on and on"
Let me guess next year Apple gonna brand their chips A18 and A18 Pro
Mkbhd it doesnt matter what company does what first just copy it But never fails to mention android has had features for years
Mobile phones can now run AAA games Read that again
still trash
It was so cool to see your quote in the keynote I was like hey I know who that is vs no idea who tom is in Toms guide
"Please can we stop pretending new Apple releases are exciting After like 10 years Apple have added the industry standard port to their old phone 
Aside from power iPhone hasnt been exciting since the X

Additionally only Apple could do USB C wrong Amazing Ive used an iPhone since 2016 but Im out"
3 minutes ago Holy
Does the iPhone 15 shoot Proraw
Worst iPhone release ever
104 The ONE PIECEEE
At least an one impression 
Why the video at 360p  First time ever i see marques upload a low quality video
053 what color is that
 love you bro super explenation
Anyone else mainly interested in the 15 because it has USBC
I can climb up to my exs room at 10th floor tying up all the lightening cables that Ive bought or been given for all those years
Finally USBC on an iPhone 
257 not actually twice as bright on a logarithmic scale
Yes only type c
Samsung has better features
"Samsung slapping themselves right now seeing the Action Button

Samsung had the Bixby button but instead of working to make it more customizable they removed it and kept its limited remap function to the power button hold if you have Good Lock which while Samsung is still third party in function

Anyways somehow they introduced USBC yet they out Androided Android phones with a single custom button"
Im so early so this is MKBSD for now
Hotel WiFi 3
they didnt do itcuz these upgrades are enoughmaybe next year this will introduce fast charging
Possible to review Mate 60 Pro series
IPhone is just behind lol
Marques reminding us the quality of iphone 1s 360p video so we can appreciate iphone 15 Respect
360p gang
Matching apple tags for pillow 
Cant wait to try resident evil village and the resident evil 4 remake that are coming to the iPhone 15 Pros Pro chips enables hardware based ray tracing sounds like a big boost to mobile gaming
Galaxy fold ads are so obvious 
Keep up the good work its better to see ur reviews then buy any tec
Very curious to see how the Dynamic Island works on a 60hz screen
360p video 
They legit quoted my man during the event
Anyone from Bangladesh 
Here you have it a new iPhone with a great marketing team behind it with nothing new compared to pixel 
Your friends Android I am that friend
"I mean who would even want to fast charge their phones





FREAKING EVERYONE"
Bruh r u kidding Video is in 360p lol

WOW So Amazing 
Iphone is iphone
I think I speak for everyone when I say that the biggest surprise this year was the lack of a price hike to account for all the innovation
why does SE not need usb C
I was double checking my WiFi connection to see video quality will improve eventually nevertheless settled at 360p
finally think its Time to retire my 12 pro max
Im not going to lie Im probably still only going to use mag safe to charge my phone  I cant wait for your full indepth review on the pro max
360p squad
I just know he will upload very soon right after the livestream
They are saving fast charging for the next year 
I am waiting for apple to release a revolutionary feature they tend to play catch up in apple way
Wy 360p only
I wish they brought back the mini series it was nice having a smaller cheaper option
Just bought a 14
And you were mentioned on stage  that was cool uh congrats man keep it up I wonder which color of the titanium to go with  but im deff getting the pro max
Welcome 360p squad
it is fun to watch iPhone users get excited for things that android users had it for years lol
Help me decide which Color to get on the pros
It was not 360p video guys
Its funny cause apple was legally forced to incorporate USBC
213 Your friends Android phoneYou nailed it bro
So Im early coz its only available in 360p
For the people upgrading this will be a huge upgrade  great video as always marques Keep it up
"Hello
There
Matey"
That port though 
Now you are MKBSD
love your review as always  big fan btw what is the point t get a faster USB 3 on Pro if we cant really extract ro transfer data like a HDD mount
Remember when 20w was considered fast charging
wow video you just uploaded videos 
 ITS OFFICIALLY TECHTEMBER 
Im too early Watching this in 360p is wild 
My boy is flying bussiness Love ya man
"not even 10 hours gone by and the dude tried the phone edited the video and uploaded it in that time
dude is getting better after every keynote"
Apple finally accepted that the port to charge all of your device with single cable is a privilege that android community were living on for many years
MKBHD 360p videoiPhone 15 and back to 2012
Wow Iphones are so innovative and daring leading the way with their cutting edge designs USB C is there only because they have been forced by the EU Delve into Android world and the choice is staggering All Apple thinks about is s

Now Im waiting for their Magic Keyboards and trackpads to charge with usbc
Watching through Starlink directly  from Brazil 
Finally
Curious to see your review of the iPhone 15 since it has a lot of the 14 Pro features Which is a huge upgrade
011 lightskin shot
Why 360p 
360p yet good quality
Do we need more performance in a phone It aint gonna make you text faster 
Been waiting for this video
360p 
Great video Marques Glad that Apple finally hears they iPhone users
ALMOST 1700 IN INDIAIPHONE IS A JOKE
cant wairt to pre order the 15 pro max i have a iphone 11 this will be a big upgrade
I can see the Blue BubbleGreen Bubble reference you did there  VERY CLEVER
Apple finally capitulated to the European Union   
"The shoutout he got from Apple in such a big event was so amazing 
Happy to see that You have come so far bro"
Marques they say you dont give hearts to people is it true
YouTube slacking as always In wont watch it in 360p Ill be back in a few minutes
Just finished Mrwhostheboss video  now watching yours whos with me 
Iphone 15 the Iphone X we all deserved 5 years ago
Nobody talking about how useless is wireless reverse charging Literally you cant use your phone if something is charging on the back Same reasoning as not being able to use the Magic Mouse while charging It is much clever to use the cable for reverse charging
Its a gorgeous phone but when you consider the 1000 price tag isnt it fair to assume that at least 50 of buyers will still throw a case on this thing even though its made from titanium
Not just USB C in the title is crazy 
HOTEL WIFI 
Just in time for my breakfast
The audio is so offyou sound like you have a sore throat  being forced to film this hands on
Iphone never ceases to amaze the consumer on how they will never change the design  the fractional power difference in the chip
Back to 2008 with this 360p
The Blue Titanium goes hard Definitely picking one up upgrading from a 12 Pro Max 
Yeah not only usbc but also new anti repair way put into this new junk
Woah the video isnt even done processing yet thats crazy
Action button already in Samsung Galaxy S8 2018
Twitter sent me
Damn Ive been waiting for his review like every 30 min since the Apple event ended
While watching the Wonderlust yesterday i was refreshing your twitter to get your first impressions was really cool and now a vid nice and thank you 
Very nice 
Same main sensor size as the 14 Pro Max 
Early enough to see crunchy 360p Marques always a pleasure
Glad Im not disappointed in picking up my purple iPhone 14 pro max then a few weeks ago lol
360p video is the best
Is that the new GFX 100 II
This is better than the apple event
I knew that Marques will not mention 60hz on base model for this expensive phones but glad he likes them
was anybody else hoping for a metallic red or pink colorway for the Prosjust me
I swear I was just searching for this video since like 10 minutes ago 
360p
Is it me but they didnt talk anything about the batteries for the pro models
"New iphone 15 I got a usb port
Iphone users   I want one "
These are just 1414pro S
Im thinking should i take 14 pro or 15 without pro What do you guys think Im afraid that the battery issue would be bad in last year model so i think i would rather buy 15 and in next 2 years 17 or 16 pro if they fix that issue
is the islandnotch change gonna be apploed to 14 too
"before the launch apple start allowing in older phone to releasing radiation low battery to force people to buy the new stupid same old phone 
but he wont criticizes cuz hes  apple cult and hes on payroll of Apple"
"Yeah 360p
Means Im early"
10 years later I still get chills from this
Is it really light
I refuse to buy the new iPhone 15 with 800 and a fking 60hz display in 2023
The 5X telephoto is an insult
28k views in 5 minutes thats crazy man
Brave dropping this in the middle of the night
Throughout the day all the YouTubers uploading their videos this is the only one thats actually worth it
Never been this early to Marques upload
Mr Quotable drops another video
"Been waiting for MKBHDs video on the Apple event 2nd fastest Ive seen a video after being uploaded 19 seconds
Was on MrWhoseTheBoss Apple event video just 2 seconds after it was uploaded"
Only 360p
520 loooool
I am gonna buy 15 for myself
"Me whos watching this video still on an iphone 5S 
Can I get at least a 7 Plus gifted "
Absolutely blown away by the cuttingedge tech showcased in this video Marques Your indepth insights and articulate explanations always make the complex seem so accessible Keep pushing the boundaries of tech journalism  youre a true inspiration 
Your friends android phone a lot of iPhone users will be mad at this they wont like the idea
FINALLYYYYY
The first Matte Black Everything iPhone
Quality 360
Why is the video quality locked at 360p
The iPhone is slowly adopting android features 
Low key flexing the new Fujifilm GFX100II through the camera app smart and ironic 
You got botted viewers How do you get 22k views in 2 minutes
after long time MKBHD  uploaded on 1440p not 4k
Dude you must feel so proud about the mentioning of your work in the presentation and you rightly should be 
Wooo
Am I the only one whos watching this on 360p resolution The quality of this video is pretty bad I wonder if it was intentional 
First name to search soon as I heard about new iPhone

Too early that the video quality is still at 360

Anyone els see only available at 360p resolution This video
Im earlier than 1080p4K 
Does the regular IPhone 15 get pro motion120Hz
Not just USB C It also supports USB 2 speeds Welcome to 2000 Its things like these that makes me hate apple
mostly just USBC
been refreshing the feed all day for this
LOVE THE VIDS THEY GET BETTER AND BETTER EACH TIME
Hey Marques  For your Waveform podcast please have your team limit the jokes and laughing around and mostly inside jokes that audience has no idea what they are talking about Focus more on actual topic of discussion As you have added more people into the live podcast they tend to keep making jokes about things and keep laughing and keep deviating from the actual topic They are not there to hangout they are there for a podcast Audience is there to listen to the podcast not them laughing around trying to be funny
"You have no idea how happy it made me when they used your review in the keynote
Just made me realise how far youve come
Kudos man"

Watching at 360p it doesnt matter
Rpido en Espaol
Marques its truly blessed both upstairs and downstairs
Shame they got rid of the Pro 128GB pushing the base price up for ProMax 
apple using reUSED items to charge you NON reUSED prices lol they think people actually give a fuck about their fake environment friendly nonsense
Been using the OnePlus 7 Pro since it came out in 2019 I might just switch to the 15 Pro Max 
What took you so long to upload
Biggest apple glazer
Why am I awake
MKBHD on the grind
Craziest feature in Apples event was the shout out to Marques
So early the video is only 360p
Im really impressed with the quality of this video considering that the event happened earlier today 
"Wow Apple really cant stop innovating USBC  What year is it Are we living in the future 

Seeing every year iPhone users getting all excited over the most trivial features is always hilarious 
"
Breakthrough moment  your name being called in the first 5 minutes And you capturing events through Pixel Fold
finally been waiting for this ALL DAY Marques ALL DAY 3 u thank you for all you do
first 3 nm chip nice
Yo yo
Pora aliya
360p only
Why is this video at 360p
Marquesyou posted at 140AM for me you cant be doing this 
Fun fact for the price of a 15 pro max in India you can get two 15 pros in the US  This things wild
The iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max seem to have that sleek design that keeps you selling one of your kidneys to be able to afford one Seems like its definitely worth the purchase
Early
Nice commercial like every of your videos
i was waiting for this 
Not the poke around
I actually do  love this upgrade
With all of todays changes I am willing to say this is the last true Super Cycle
Hi MK
Bring back touchID to the power button
Finally mkbhd
You know you made it when the video is at 360p and it still looks good
I have a really old phone Trying to have a new phone a functional one Is the 15 pro with it or should I go for the 14
Watching in my 5s
I dont like the 15 line up wallpaper this year 
Why is the quality of this videos 360p
Hopefully theyre in stock and not getting scalped
Finally 
MB name was pinned at launch Thats something
What about 60 hz display at these expensive phones
Got a Samsung ad 
Techtubers are shooting new iPhone content in order like students handing over their students 
I think the best update to the iPhones design is usability Finally doesnt feel like Im hold a squared brick in my hand
Watchingon hotel wifi
Feels like a rebranded iPhone 14 Going to skip this year
Lol just after I watched mrwhostheboss vids covering iphone 15
The video weve been waiting for
"104
"
The moment that youre that early watching the video that just the 360p version is available 
"Im a huge fan marques
Minor improvements and changes
An all round better package
I use an iphone x and i cant even afford a 12 and were talking about the 15 series  nah"
Why is this video 360p
Oh great i can finally buy iphone 12 now
Love from India  big fan
Lightning to Type C converters
Still 360p 
My eyes on 15 plus 
Your late who else kept refreshing you tube to see if mkbhd uploaded the apple i phone 15 pro hands on video Lol
What I have been waiting for a MKBHD video
Ive never been this early
This event could have been an email
The standard iPhones have USB C 20 Apple always being Apple
I can explain it to you But I can not understand it for you  Peace 
fast charge 
this is what we re expecting USBC
Ahh Im glad to see this I was online just waiting for this video from this channel 
Waiting for MKHBD REVIEW
MKB360p 
USB C change may actually be the convincing factor to switch to Apple
Love from India 
I am excited to see the titanium in person and see how much lighter the phone feels did you feel a noticeable difference in weight
Was Eagerly waiting for your review 
Congrats on the mention by the CEO
The review everyone was waiting for since the apple event finished lol thank you  
"hey bro
Subtitle plz add video"
a
Its not worth it Then Ill wait for the next year to buy a new iPhone
its crazy how excited we are for usbc on iPhone
Thank you to the European Union for giving us USBC iPhones Shame America dont have the spine to have good proconsumer laws and will bend over to any corpo that throws money at them
Y quality is only 360p
Finally the video I am ready for
Will iPhone users upgrade to a 15 or choose the 14 so they dont have to get a new charger
Wayyyy to early
Hello Marques please help support my college tuition
I think apple should bring back the s naming scheme back this phone feels more like a 14s Pro than a 15
Video is still in 360p 
Oh yea its JUST usb c
Why is this video in 360p
With a Titanium body I wouldnt even put a case on that iPhone Ive had my titanium Apple Watch Ultra for 10 months now worn it every single day and it looks like it just came out of the box
360p fam where u at 
That blue titanium is just marvelous  Great video as always happy to see usbc 
Team Samsung
When you dont want to be too criticize so you dont get blacklisted by Apple lol
Whats the battery capacity
Watching in 360p 
Looking forward to pay around with these See if they are really that different from the last few years
Been waiting the whole day for thisGreat video and welcome to California
Love your content man It gets better and better You are a huge voice in the tech industry and I think you a great example of what a human can do when being so passionate about something
Whys this 360p
iPhone 15 is alright
Is it me or the audio a bit off
Also I like how apple thinks adding USB C was a leap forward even though they had too
makabahada
11 year iPhone useriPhone  borIng phones
Dynamic Island 
who couldnt afford it like me 
So any different to the 14 pro Besides USB c and toggle button is it worth it
USB C is really it End of video 
You know youre early when the videos only in 360p
Hoping that 15 pros actualy have a good battery lifes cause Apple is claiming that they have same battery life as 14 pros
So the camera is really massive I could get behind the 61 pro cause I like the size
Just 360p huh 
I love the way Apple put your review name in Pitch MKBHD   I wish I have this Iphone 15 pro titanium
Well well well What are yall upgrading from Im going from a 12 pro to the 15 pro
Literally went to ur yt channel to see if u made a vid yet Sick timing
I love this upgrade Seriously considering an upgrade from my 14 pro max The A17 pro and support for log and aces I mean  its amazing I think weve hit peak smartphone now
360p gang where you at
Titanium seems cool
The fact that the only significant update I see is a usb type C is funny 
Its justttttttt type C nothing special we all know deep inside 
ive been waiting to upgrade my 11
Apple invented USBC today
Well iphone 14 is now cheaper buy that one
Wow Apple caught up to 2016 Truly amazing
FINALLY
Didnt go to sleep was waiting for this video Love your content Marquess gotta get that iPhone 15 Plus in black or blue
Ive been waiting for this video
Hiii
Op dude
Honestly Mid
The 15 Pro Max Titanium finally moves me to an Apple product for the 1st time ever Always something else better
It has actually the same thinghs that Android had years before 
iPhone 14
Meh it looks the same
This is the most used port in our products is such an apple thing to say
Video quality is 360P worst ever from MB
I have been waiting for this Upload God bless you all
First time I experience MKB360p
I said no upgrading but Im upgrading 
I was SHOOK when you got a mention by name from Tim Cook at the beginning of the presentation
MKBHD flew there on a United 777200ER dont ask why I can tell that just from that intro clip
I literally waited this long now I dont want to upgrade my 14 pro max
Its iPhone 14 pro pro
Waiting all day for this Thanks for pushing it out
The Studio team Cupertino California yet again
IPhone 15 seems more value with Dynamic island and USBC and better cam  3 attractive features I see But still 60Hz and No Fast charging sucks
Colours are cool Specially Pinky   Natural Titanium 
I literally was thinking man when is MKBHDs video coming out Im about to buy my first iPhone ever and want to see the first thoughts coming from an S22 Ultra Then I get here 30 seconds after he posts it
Why is the vid 360p only
360p videos always hit different
The regular 15 isnt worth it atp Just get the 14 pro
is the vid quality only 360p
Apple out here following ferrari business model
I was waiting
MKBHD shoutout in the apple live was sexy ngl
iPhone 15 Pro is everything changed 
I decided not to waste an hour and a half to watch the Apple event today so that I can just watch this
You are so early that you only get 320p 
So Ive been using iPhone 15 for a couple weeks
50 seconds ago this is the fatest iver been
First P

Biggest tech influencer 
This is legit nice exploring
Le 3eme vue trop nul le Usb C
USB C on airpods pro is the game changer for me
Im buying USB C is a game changer
Work hard play hard  excited to watch this Thanks
I felt so proud when I saw you being mentioned in this event Finally some recognition
They all look boring no cap
Ive been stuck on my galaxy s21 plus for a couple years now this phone might make me upgrade to iPhone 15 pro max
YOUR VIDEO INSPIRED ME AND BRIGHTENED MY DAYKEEP SPREADING YOUR POSITIVITY AND PASSION WITH ALL OF USYOURE INCREDIBLE
Leaving an iphone 14 for a 15 is actual downgrading 
So I have been using Type C for 15 years now
can i get a new phone 
The fact that MKBHD was also published in apple event is worth it
Who Else Loves MKBHD
